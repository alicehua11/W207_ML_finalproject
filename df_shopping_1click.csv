But how about the 25 people jockeying to replace him as president? Forbes dug into the details—examining financial disclosure statements, scouring local real estate records and calculating pension benefits—to figure out the finances of the 2020 candidates.There were some surprises. Bernie is a millionaire. So is “middle-class Joe” Biden. Elizabeth Warren is richer than both of them, worth an estimated $12 million. But she’s a long way from John Delaney, whose $200 million fortune makes him twice as wealthy as every other Democratic candidate not named Tom Steyer or Michael Bloomberg.Aside from Trump, Steyer and Bloomberg, the average net worth is $12.9 million—the same as it was for the 2016 contenders. The median net worth is $2 million. The poorest is Pete Buttigieg, who has an estimated $100,000—or about 0.003% of Trump’s fortune.We reached out to the candidates. No one, not even the Democrats who spend the most time bashing Trump for his financial dealings, answered every question. So we ranked the entire field on transparency, assigning scores ranging from 0 (lips sealed) to 5 (full disclosure). In the end, we uncovered the money, regardless of whether the candidates wanted it out in the open.In November, former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg joined a dozen other Democrats aiming to unseat Donald Trump. He has the money to compete, thanks to an 88% stake in financial information company Bloomberg LP, which generates an estimated $10 billion in annual revenue and throws off piles of cash. Bloomberg used $250 million of his own money running for mayor three times, and he has funneled $8 billion into philanthropic and activist causes, including fighting climate change and guns.The billionaire-in-chief is rich enough to fund his entire presidential campaign by himself. Not that he will. While donors around the country have been pitching in to support his reelection effort, the richest president in American history has donated exactly $0 of his own, according to the latest filings.After years of backing other Democrats, the hedge funder is trying his own luck as a candidate. Money won’t be an issue. Steyer founded Farallon Capital in 1986 and turned it into one of the largest hedge fund firms in the country. He stepped back in 2012 to focus on politics and philanthropy, concentrating his early efforts on protecting the environment. That struck some people as odd, given that he had previously invested in the fossil-fuel industry. Oil tycoon Harold Hamm, a prominent Trump supporter, once called Steyer “the world’s biggest hypocrite.” For his part, Steyer said he had a change of heart and divested his old fossil-fuel holdings.Delaney made a fortune in the business world before serving three terms in Congress. The son of a union electrician, he launched HealthCare Financial Partners, a lender to health care businesses, in 1993. One of his major backers: Tom Steyer, whose hedge fund invested $25 million. Delaney took HealthCare Financial Partners public in 1996 and pocketed $30 million when he sold it three years later to Heller Financial (later rolled into GE Capital). He quickly founded a second company, commercial lender CapitalSource, raising $542 million to launch it—$190 million of it from Steyer’s firm.The Democratic senator got millions working for Republican megadonor Philip Anschutz. After serving in the Justice Department during the Clinton administration, Bennet left Washington in 1997 to join the Anschutz Investment Company. There, he worked on a deal to merge three movie theater chains into Regal Entertainment Group and ultimately joined its board of directors. Today his assets include hedge fund holdings and Colorado real estate.Teachers aren’t paid so poorly after all—at least not Harvard professors. Warren and her husband, Bruce Mann, both longtime instructors at the university, have built up a small fortune through years of teaching, writing and consulting. Their largest holdings include TIAA and CREF accounts—available to educators and nonprofit employees—worth more than $4 million. One of their best investments has been their home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, purchased in 1995 for $447,000. It’s now worth an estimated $3 million.“Middle-class Joe” is now solidly upper class. The former vice president and his wife, Jill, earned more than $15 million in the two years after they left the White House, cashing in on a multi-book deal with publisher Flatiron. In 2017, they dropped $2.7 million on a 4,800-square-foot pad in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. The next year, they paid off a mortgage on their other home, in Wilmington, Delaware.Senator Harris married lawyer Douglas Emhoff in 2014, creating a California power couple. She brought the clout, and he brought the money. Since then, they have raked in $8.2 million—most of it from Emhoff’s work at law firms Venable and DLA Piper. The couple owns homes in Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco, worth a combined $5.8 million before debt.Sestak graduated second in his class at the U.S. Naval Academy in 1974 and retired as a three-star admiral three decades later. For his service, he gets roughly $120,000 every year for the rest of his life. That pension is worth nearly $1.5 million. Sestak has funneled his salary into a diversified portfolio, which includes more than $15,000 of Apple stock and at least $100,000 in Amazon shares.The former Texas congressman married into a rich family—his wife, Amy, is the daughter of an El Paso real estate tycoon—but only a small chunk of that wealth has trickled down to the couple. Their largest asset is a note held by Amy, worth $2.5 million, according to a campaign spokesperson. Beto holds a minority interest in a $2.5 million El Paso strip mall, which he got from his mother.Elizabeth Warren announces her bid for president on Feb. 9, 2019 in Lawrence, Massachusetts.Mayor Bill de Blasio has spent most of his life in public service, but like the Oval Office occupant he hopes to replace, he owes his fortune to timely investments in New York City real estate. In 2000 de Blasio, who held a handful of city and federal jobs before being elected mayor, and his wife bought a 1,200-square-foot row house on a quiet Brooklyn block. Four years later, they picked up a 1,600-square-footer just down the road. Since then, real estate values have skyrocketed. Last year de Blasio collected $108,450 by renting out the two properties while he and his family live in Gracie Mansion, the mayor’s official residence.Turns out, the socialist senator is a pretty successful capitalist. After running for president in 2016, Sanders inked three lucrative book deals that have brought him more than $2 million so far, catapulting him into the 1%. Since the 2016 election, he has shelled out $575,000 for a northern Vermont summer home and paid off a 30-year mortgage on his Burlington, Vermont, house—25 years early.Since 1988, Inslee has bounced back and forth between the Washington state government (serving as a legislator and now governor) and the federal government (representing Washington’s 4th district, then its 1st district). That’s made him eligible for an estimated $68,000 per year for life in state and federal pensions, an income stream worth around $750,000 in all. He owns a five-bedroom, $1 million home outside Seattle.A prosecutor turned politician, Klobuchar holds a plain-vanilla portfolio. Her retirement holdings include a federal pension worth an estimated $560,000, the result of 12 years in the U.S. senate.When the New Jersey senator arrived in Washington in 2013, he owned stock in companies like Netflix, Facebook and Amazon. He sold all of that within a year of taking office, putting the proceeds into checking and savings accounts. Today Booker’s portfolio includes a 2,800-square-foot house in Newark, where he served as mayor from 2006 to 2013, and a New Jersey state pension. His federal tax returns show average annual giving of 11%, higher than any of the other 14 candidates who have released their filings.This is a modal window.The governor of Montana is a small-time landlord. He owns 50% of a historic building in Helena, Montana, where he rents out two commercial spaces and one residential apartment. It’s in a convenient location for Bullock, just a mile down the road from his office at the state capitol. His stake is worth roughly $300,000 after debt. The rest of Bullock’s portfolio is mostly composed of retirement accounts.   Williamson made millions as a self-help guru and author (with books like the 1992 bestseller A Return To Love), but she hasn’t held onto most of the money. What she does have sits in mutual funds, money market accounts and cash accounts, along with a handful of publicly traded stocks like Apple, Home Depot and VF Corp. While Williamson is not likely to win the election, she’ll almost certainly make money off her campaign: In April, she released her latest book, A Politics of Love.Gillibrand owns a $350,000 home in Troy, New York, with her husband, Jonathan. She’s the breadwinner, earning $174,000 annually for serving in the senate. He made just $185,000 as a consultant and investor between 2007 and 2018, according to tax returns. Their most valuable asset appears to be Gillibrand’s federal pension, worth an estimated $450,000.Moulton got a physics degree from Harvard, then joined the Marine Corps and served four tours in Iraq. Back Stateside, he used the G.I. Bill to get master's degrees from Harvard’s public policy and business schools, before running for Congress. His $1 million fortune is largely spread among mutual funds, index funds and a 2,750-square-foot condo in Salem, Massachusetts.Joe Biden arrives for a campaign kickoff rally on May 18, 2019 in Philadelphia.The son of Taiwanese immigrants, Yang left a corporate law gig to go into the startup world. In 2000 he cofounded Stargiving.com, a website that gave charitable donors the chance to meet celebrities. After it folded he went to work for small mobile software and healthcare companies, then became CEO of test prep business Manhattan Prep in 2006. Yang helped grow the company to $11 million in revenues before industry giant Kaplan bought it in 2009 for tens of millions.Barack Obama’s former secretary of housing and urban development has more than $100,000 in cash accounts, plus stock in a handful of mutual funds. After Obama left office, Castro joined the faculty of the University of Texas’ school of public affairs. His $40,000-per-year university pension is worth about $110,000. He also owns a modest, 2,000-square-foot home in San Antonio, where he served as mayor from 2009 to 2014.Gabbard invested in the cryptocurrency craze in 2017, buying between $2,000 and $30,000 worth of Litecoin and Ethereum, according to documents she filed with the government. By the time she turned in her most recent financial disclosure report, in July 2019, she had gotten rid of those investments. It’s not clear if she made money on them. Most of her fortune is tied up in an $865,000 home in Washington, D.C., which has an estimated $560,000 in debt against it.Elected to the House of Representatives at 29 years old, Ryan has been earning a congressional salary for years. After getting a law degree in 2000, he briefly served in the Ohio state senate, then won his House seat in 2002. In 2013, Ryan married a public school teacher, who is still paying off her student loans, according to his most recent financial disclosure report. Mayor Pete has enough money to live comfortably in the Midwest, but he’s still the poorest 2020 contender. Chalk that up to his age (at 37, he’s the youngest candidate), student loan debt and his decision to give up a lucrative McKinsey job to run for treasurer of his home state of Indiana in 2010. He lost but got a six-figure gig as mayor of South Bend two years later. Still, he and his husband, Chasten, a former teacher, disclosed between $100,000 and $230,000 in student loans.Get Forbes’ daily top headlines straight to your inbox for news on the world’s most important entrepreneurs and superstars, expert career advice, and success secrets.I am a senior editor at Forbes, as well as the author of White House, Inc.: How Donald Trump Turned the Presidency into a Business, released Sept. 22, 2020.

Symba’s platform connects companies with talented remote interns from around the world and curates meaningful remote internship experiences. Gupta and her co-founder, Ahva Sadeghi, recently closed their first financing round. They learned a lot during the process about how to pitch their mission.“Start with a personal anecdote—paint a picture for your audience,” offers the 2020 30 Under 30 honoree and Cornell University graduate in computer science and engineering. “If you tell a real story about yourself, it makes the pitch more relatable. Be natural and don’t force anything.“Second,” Gupta says, “your audience needs to know you’re the right person to make this idea real. Stress right away that you have the appropriate skill sets and the relevant experience for the job. “Third, if investors don’t understand the problem your idea is intended to solve, your idea isn’t going to make any sense to them. Make it as clear as possible how your business is going to provide value in the world.”Agent Phil Quist, a 2018 Under 30 honoree, hasn’t only given his share of presentations. At Creative Artists Agency, where he represents top musical talent, he’s been on the receiving end of more of them than he can count. What works when you’re standing in front of a conference room full of people with the power to make your project come to life?“A pitch should tell a story,” says Quist, who got hooked on the music business when he promoted Dallas-area concerts as a student at Southern Methodist University. “And like every good story, it should have a beginning, a middle and an end.“Be sure, too, to make clear what’s unique about your product/business. You’d be surprised to learn how many pitches I’ve been through that don’t include that key point.“Finally,” Quist says, “explain your revenue model and growth plan. People want to hear about your finances. At the end of the day, your project has to be a sustainable proposition.”Sarah Ahmed, a 2018 Under 30 list member, was chief creative officer at the eco-conscious premium denim brand DL1961 before founding Warp + Weft, a jeans brand that stresses sustainable manufacturing and body-type inclusivity. It’s perhaps her passion for making a difference that informs her advice about giving an effective pitch.“Start your pitch with an easy-to-digest synthesis of your company that ties into a macro trend or problem,” says Ahmed. “Setting up context for your pitch not only makes it impactful, but subconsciously defines the market need for your product or service,” adds the Parsons School of Design grad.WeTransfer was founded in 2009 as the simplest way to send big files around the world.

2,['https://www.forbes.com/sites/servicenow/2020/10/15/using-iot-data-to-drive-customer-satisfaction/'],['ServiceNow BrandVoice: Using IoT Data To Drive Customer Satisfaction'],"[""When the term Internet of Things (IoT) first gained popularity a decade ago, many futurists looked forward excitedly to the commercial and industrial applications of these always-on, always-connected data sources.Today, smart homes and internet-enabled personal devices are ubiquitous and commercially successful, but B2B applications haven’t seen the same success. Vast pools of underutilized IoT data are left to grow stale in organizational silos.It’s little wonder, when one considers the numbers:Nearly 80 zettabytes? That’s 80,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. “We’re building IoT systems that take data from all these devices, and this data is classified as alerts,” or active signals, says Dave Wright, ServiceNow’s chief innovation officer. “The challenge then becomes: What do you do with all of these alerts?”There’s untapped value hidden within these massive data volumes, Wright believes—particularly when IoT data is integrated with a customer service management platform (CSM) using smart workflows. Device data can be analyzed to prioritize service calls, for example, add value to a customer contract, even predict and prevent costly equipment failures.“With the number of connected assets set to increase dramatically,” — an estimated 41.6 billion devices by 2025, according to research — “it’s important that we start to analyze and understand the business context of any given device,” Wright says. “In the world of connected assets, no one has really focused on this before.”Keep reading to learn how connected enterprises use smart workflows to analyze IoT data in real time — and deliver measurable ROI in customer service, field engineering and other mission-critical departments.At first glance, TAPCO may seem like an unlikely source of cutting-edge IoT innovation. Since 1956, the third-generation, family-owned company has been making traffic signs for customers in all 50 states. In fact TAPCO was an early, insightful adopter of IoT.Today, the Wisconsin-based company provides an impressive array of internet-enabled products, including radar-equipped speed limit signs; programmable traffic safety displays; pedestrian crosswalk systems; and Wrong-Way driver alerts, which automatically detect cars driving in the wrong direction.To make better use of these always-on streams of device data, TAPCO’s leadership partnered with ServiceNow to pilot Connected Operations, a new product that uses existing IoT signals for customer support and field service applications.Before Connected Operations, data collected from IoT devices was stored and indexed on their own network and servers. ServiceNow saw opportunities to connect these signals to Customer Service Management (CSM) and Field Service Management (FSM), yielding greater automation and efficiency.Consider the chain of events following an equipment failure. When the solar panel on a speed limit sign fails, for example, a signal is sent to the service center. Before Connected Operations. A human being identified this particular sign and searched through customer records, asking: Is this item under warranty? Does the client have a service contract? How should this ticket be prioritized?Only then is a field service engineer dispatched.Thanks to Connected Operations, much of this process has been automated. Now, a device’s fail signal triggers an automatic search of TAPCO’s equipment records, and all pertinent information is delivered directly to customer service and the remote operations center simultaneously.Now, service decisions are made more quickly and accurately. Downtime is reduced and repairs can cost less. In some cases, issues are resolved even before the customer is aware of the problem.The trial program—currently deployed on TAPCO’s Wrong-Way driver alerts systems—brought greater capabilities to both customer service and field service by creating new, smart workflows that seamlessly pass data and analysis between once-separate departments.“The power it gives us is incredible,” says Jason Anderson, TAPCO’s IT director and member of the executive team.“For us, there was a lot of opportunity to move to a digital workflow,” says Anderson. “Not having to jump back and forth between multiple systems, not having to look up contracts over on this file server, not having to look up the customer contact,” he adds. “All that information is right here, gathered when the alert arrives.”This, says Anderson, has allowed TAPCO to continue serving long-time clients—many relationships go back decades—with cutting-edge, data-driven products featuring greater uptime, lower lifetime costs and greater overall customer satisfaction.TAPCO’s customers are also empowered. Working on a single integrated platform, they can now submit service requests, check a work order status and track new equipment orders. Thanks to these newly unlocked IoT data sources, these benefits are realized in near-real time.“Having a seamless, end-to-end workflow…is a huge efficiency gain for us and our customers,” Anderson says. “Now, we’re making decisions based on real data, instead of gut feelings.”As TAPCO’s experience demonstrates, it’s an exciting time to build more fully connected enterprises that use IoT-based data sources to improve the customer service experience. But this is just the beginning, says ServiceNow’s Dave Wright, who offers three examples of what’s coming across industries in the near future.The Internet of Things has come a long way since the term was first coined in 1999, then popularized in the ‘00s. Tens of billions of devices are already online, and billions more are expected to connect in the next few years.As to the question of what we can do with so much data, Dave Wright is excited to see what comes next — particularly when the use cases are essential to public health .“We've had other companies ask about monitoring wind speeds to decide whether they should shut down amusement park rides,” Wright says. “The level of importance being put on data is very interesting, especially when it might have life-or-death consequences.”ServiceNow is making the world of work, work better for people. Our cloud-based platform and solutions deliver digital workflows that create great experiences and unlock…""]","['68,981 views']",['Innovation'],"['Oct 15, 2020, 09:00am EDT']"

While Williamson is not likely to win the election, she’ll almost certainly make money off her campaign: In April, she released her latest book, A Politics of Love.Gillibrand owns a $350,000 home in Troy, New York, with her husband, Jonathan. She’s the breadwinner, earning $174,000 annually for serving in the senate. He made just $185,000 as a consultant and investor between 2007 and 2018, according to tax returns. Their most valuable asset appears to be Gillibrand’s federal pension, worth an estimated $450,000.Moulton got a physics degree from Harvard, then joined the Marine Corps and served four tours in Iraq.

After Obama left office, Castro joined the faculty of the University of Texas’ school of public affairs. His $40,000-per-year university pension is worth about $110,000. He also owns a modest, 2,000-square-foot home in San Antonio, where he served as mayor from 2009 to 2014.Gabbard invested in the cryptocurrency craze in 2017, buying between $2,000 and $30,000 worth of Litecoin and Ethereum, according to documents she filed with the government. By the time she turned in her most recent financial disclosure report, in July 2019, she had gotten rid of those investments. It’s not clear if she made money on them. Most of her fortune is tied up in an $865,000 home in Washington, D.C., which has an estimated $560,000 in debt against it.Elected to the House of Representatives at 29 years old, Ryan has been earning a congressional salary for years. After getting a law degree in 2000, he briefly served in the Ohio state senate, then won his House seat in 2002. In 2013, Ryan married a public school teacher, who is still paying off her student loans, according to his most recent financial disclosure report. Mayor Pete has enough money to live comfortably in the Midwest, but he’s still the poorest 2020 contender. Chalk that up to his age (at 37, he’s the youngest candidate), student loan debt and his decision to give up a lucrative McKinsey job to run for treasurer of his home state of Indiana in 2010. He lost but got a six-figure gig as mayor of South Bend two years later. Still, he and his husband, Chasten, a former teacher, disclosed between $100,000 and $230,000 in student loans.Get Forbes’ daily top headlines straight to your inbox for news on the world’s most important entrepreneurs and superstars, expert career advice, and success secrets.I am a senior editor at Forbes, as well as the author of White House, Inc.: How Donald Trump Turned the Presidency into a Business, released Sept. 22, 2020.

Symba’s platform connects companies with talented remote interns from around the world and curates meaningful remote internship experiences. Gupta and her co-founder, Ahva Sadeghi, recently closed their first financing round. They learned a lot during the process about how to pitch their mission.“Start with a personal anecdote—paint a picture for your audience,” offers the 2020 30 Under 30 honoree and Cornell University graduate in computer science and engineering. “If you tell a real story about yourself, it makes the pitch more relatable. Be natural and don’t force anything.“Second,” Gupta says, “your audience needs to know you’re the right person to make this idea real. Stress right away that you have the appropriate skill sets and the relevant experience for the job. “Third, if investors don’t understand the problem your idea is intended to solve, your idea isn’t going to make any sense to them. Make it as clear as possible how your business is going to provide value in the world.”Agent Phil Quist, a 2018 Under 30 honoree, hasn’t only given his share of presentations. At Creative Artists Agency, where he represents top musical talent, he’s been on the receiving end of more of them than he can count.

You’d be surprised to learn how many pitches I’ve been through that don’t include that key point.“Finally,” Quist says, “explain your revenue model and growth plan. People want to hear about your finances. At the end of the day, your project has to be a sustainable proposition.”Sarah Ahmed, a 2018 Under 30 list member, was chief creative officer at the eco-conscious premium denim brand DL1961 before founding Warp + Weft, a jeans brand that stresses sustainable manufacturing and body-type inclusivity.

5,['https://www.forbes.com/sites/servicenow/2020/10/15/using-iot-data-to-drive-customer-satisfaction/'],['ServiceNow BrandVoice: Using IoT Data To Drive Customer Satisfaction'],"[""When the term Internet of Things (IoT) first gained popularity a decade ago, many futurists looked forward excitedly to the commercial and industrial applications of these always-on, always-connected data sources.Today, smart homes and internet-enabled personal devices are ubiquitous and commercially successful, but B2B applications haven’t seen the same success. Vast pools of underutilized IoT data are left to grow stale in organizational silos.It’s little wonder, when one considers the numbers:Nearly 80 zettabytes? That’s 80,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. “We’re building IoT systems that take data from all these devices, and this data is classified as alerts,” or active signals, says Dave Wright, ServiceNow’s chief innovation officer. “The challenge then becomes: What do you do with all of these alerts?”There’s untapped value hidden within these massive data volumes, Wright believes—particularly when IoT data is integrated with a customer service management platform (CSM) using smart workflows. Device data can be analyzed to prioritize service calls, for example, add value to a customer contract, even predict and prevent costly equipment failures.“With the number of connected assets set to increase dramatically,” — an estimated 41.6 billion devices by 2025, according to research — “it’s important that we start to analyze and understand the business context of any given device,” Wright says. “In the world of connected assets, no one has really focused on this before.”Keep reading to learn how connected enterprises use smart workflows to analyze IoT data in real time — and deliver measurable ROI in customer service, field engineering and other mission-critical departments.At first glance, TAPCO may seem like an unlikely source of cutting-edge IoT innovation. Since 1956, the third-generation, family-owned company has been making traffic signs for customers in all 50 states. In fact TAPCO was an early, insightful adopter of IoT.Today, the Wisconsin-based company provides an impressive array of internet-enabled products, including radar-equipped speed limit signs; programmable traffic safety displays; pedestrian crosswalk systems; and Wrong-Way driver alerts, which automatically detect cars driving in the wrong direction.To make better use of these always-on streams of device data, TAPCO’s leadership partnered with ServiceNow to pilot Connected Operations, a new product that uses existing IoT signals for customer support and field service applications.Before Connected Operations, data collected from IoT devices was stored and indexed on their own network and servers. ServiceNow saw opportunities to connect these signals to Customer Service Management (CSM) and Field Service Management (FSM), yielding greater automation and efficiency.Consider the chain of events following an equipment failure. When the solar panel on a speed limit sign fails, for example, a signal is sent to the service center. Before Connected Operations. A human being identified this particular sign and searched through customer records, asking: Is this item under warranty? Does the client have a service contract? How should this ticket be prioritized?Only then is a field service engineer dispatched.Thanks to Connected Operations, much of this process has been automated. Now, a device’s fail signal triggers an automatic search of TAPCO’s equipment records, and all pertinent information is delivered directly to customer service and the remote operations center simultaneously.Now, service decisions are made more quickly and accurately. Downtime is reduced and repairs can cost less. In some cases, issues are resolved even before the customer is aware of the problem.The trial program—currently deployed on TAPCO’s Wrong-Way driver alerts systems—brought greater capabilities to both customer service and field service by creating new, smart workflows that seamlessly pass data and analysis between once-separate departments.“The power it gives us is incredible,” says Jason Anderson, TAPCO’s IT director and member of the executive team.“For us, there was a lot of opportunity to move to a digital workflow,” says Anderson. “Not having to jump back and forth between multiple systems, not having to look up contracts over on this file server, not having to look up the customer contact,” he adds. “All that information is right here, gathered when the alert arrives.”This, says Anderson, has allowed TAPCO to continue serving long-time clients—many relationships go back decades—with cutting-edge, data-driven products featuring greater uptime, lower lifetime costs and greater overall customer satisfaction.TAPCO’s customers are also empowered. Working on a single integrated platform, they can now submit service requests, check a work order status and track new equipment orders. Thanks to these newly unlocked IoT data sources, these benefits are realized in near-real time.“Having a seamless, end-to-end workflow…is a huge efficiency gain for us and our customers,” Anderson says. “Now, we’re making decisions based on real data, instead of gut feelings.”As TAPCO’s experience demonstrates, it’s an exciting time to build more fully connected enterprises that use IoT-based data sources to improve the customer service experience. But this is just the beginning, says ServiceNow’s Dave Wright, who offers three examples of what’s coming across industries in the near future.The Internet of Things has come a long way since the term was first coined in 1999, then popularized in the ‘00s. Tens of billions of devices are already online, and billions more are expected to connect in the next few years.As to the question of what we can do with so much data, Dave Wright is excited to see what comes next — particularly when the use cases are essential to public health .“We've had other companies ask about monitoring wind speeds to decide whether they should shut down amusement park rides,” Wright says. “The level of importance being put on data is very interesting, especially when it might have life-or-death consequences.”ServiceNow is making the world of work, work better for people. Our cloud-based platform and solutions deliver digital workflows that create great experiences and unlock…""]","['68,981 views']",['Innovation'],"['Oct 15, 2020, 09:00am EDT']"
