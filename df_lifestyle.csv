But how about the 25 people jockeying to replace him as president? Forbes dug into the details—examining financial disclosure statements, scouring local real estate records and calculating pension benefits—to figure out the finances of the 2020 candidates.There were some surprises. Bernie is a millionaire. So is “middle-class Joe” Biden. Elizabeth Warren is richer than both of them, worth an estimated $12 million. But she’s a long way from John Delaney, whose $200 million fortune makes him twice as wealthy as every other Democratic candidate not named Tom Steyer or Michael Bloomberg.Aside from Trump, Steyer and Bloomberg, the average net worth is $12.9 million—the same as it was for the 2016 contenders. The median net worth is $2 million. The poorest is Pete Buttigieg, who has an estimated $100,000—or about 0.003% of Trump’s fortune.We reached out to the candidates. No one, not even the Democrats who spend the most time bashing Trump for his financial dealings, answered every question. So we ranked the entire field on transparency, assigning scores ranging from 0 (lips sealed) to 5 (full disclosure). In the end, we uncovered the money, regardless of whether the candidates wanted it out in the open.In November, former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg joined a dozen other Democrats aiming to unseat Donald Trump. He has the money to compete, thanks to an 88% stake in financial information company Bloomberg LP, which generates an estimated $10 billion in annual revenue and throws off piles of cash. Bloomberg used $250 million of his own money running for mayor three times, and he has funneled $8 billion into philanthropic and activist causes, including fighting climate change and guns.The billionaire-in-chief is rich enough to fund his entire presidential campaign by himself. Not that he will. While donors around the country have been pitching in to support his reelection effort, the richest president in American history has donated exactly $0 of his own, according to the latest filings.After years of backing other Democrats, the hedge funder is trying his own luck as a candidate. Money won’t be an issue. Steyer founded Farallon Capital in 1986 and turned it into one of the largest hedge fund firms in the country. He stepped back in 2012 to focus on politics and philanthropy, concentrating his early efforts on protecting the environment. That struck some people as odd, given that he had previously invested in the fossil-fuel industry. Oil tycoon Harold Hamm, a prominent Trump supporter, once called Steyer “the world’s biggest hypocrite.” For his part, Steyer said he had a change of heart and divested his old fossil-fuel holdings.Delaney made a fortune in the business world before serving three terms in Congress. The son of a union electrician, he launched HealthCare Financial Partners, a lender to health care businesses, in 1993. One of his major backers: Tom Steyer, whose hedge fund invested $25 million. Delaney took HealthCare Financial Partners public in 1996 and pocketed $30 million when he sold it three years later to Heller Financial (later rolled into GE Capital). He quickly founded a second company, commercial lender CapitalSource, raising $542 million to launch it—$190 million of it from Steyer’s firm.The Democratic senator got millions working for Republican megadonor Philip Anschutz. After serving in the Justice Department during the Clinton administration, Bennet left Washington in 1997 to join the Anschutz Investment Company. There, he worked on a deal to merge three movie theater chains into Regal Entertainment Group and ultimately joined its board of directors. Today his assets include hedge fund holdings and Colorado real estate.Teachers aren’t paid so poorly after all—at least not Harvard professors. Warren and her husband, Bruce Mann, both longtime instructors at the university, have built up a small fortune through years of teaching, writing and consulting. Their largest holdings include TIAA and CREF accounts—available to educators and nonprofit employees—worth more than $4 million. One of their best investments has been their home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, purchased in 1995 for $447,000. It’s now worth an estimated $3 million.“Middle-class Joe” is now solidly upper class. The former vice president and his wife, Jill, earned more than $15 million in the two years after they left the White House, cashing in on a multi-book deal with publisher Flatiron. In 2017, they dropped $2.7 million on a 4,800-square-foot pad in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. The next year, they paid off a mortgage on their other home, in Wilmington, Delaware.Senator Harris married lawyer Douglas Emhoff in 2014, creating a California power couple. She brought the clout, and he brought the money. Since then, they have raked in $8.2 million—most of it from Emhoff’s work at law firms Venable and DLA Piper. The couple owns homes in Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco, worth a combined $5.8 million before debt.Sestak graduated second in his class at the U.S. Naval Academy in 1974 and retired as a three-star admiral three decades later. For his service, he gets roughly $120,000 every year for the rest of his life. That pension is worth nearly $1.5 million. Sestak has funneled his salary into a diversified portfolio, which includes more than $15,000 of Apple stock and at least $100,000 in Amazon shares.The former Texas congressman married into a rich family—his wife, Amy, is the daughter of an El Paso real estate tycoon—but only a small chunk of that wealth has trickled down to the couple. Their largest asset is a note held by Amy, worth $2.5 million, according to a campaign spokesperson. Beto holds a minority interest in a $2.5 million El Paso strip mall, which he got from his mother.Elizabeth Warren announces her bid for president on Feb. 9, 2019 in Lawrence, Massachusetts.Mayor Bill de Blasio has spent most of his life in public service, but like the Oval Office occupant he hopes to replace, he owes his fortune to timely investments in New York City real estate. In 2000 de Blasio, who held a handful of city and federal jobs before being elected mayor, and his wife bought a 1,200-square-foot row house on a quiet Brooklyn block. Four years later, they picked up a 1,600-square-footer just down the road. Since then, real estate values have skyrocketed. Last year de Blasio collected $108,450 by renting out the two properties while he and his family live in Gracie Mansion, the mayor’s official residence.Turns out, the socialist senator is a pretty successful capitalist. After running for president in 2016, Sanders inked three lucrative book deals that have brought him more than $2 million so far, catapulting him into the 1%. Since the 2016 election, he has shelled out $575,000 for a northern Vermont summer home and paid off a 30-year mortgage on his Burlington, Vermont, house—25 years early.Since 1988, Inslee has bounced back and forth between the Washington state government (serving as a legislator and now governor) and the federal government (representing Washington’s 4th district, then its 1st district). That’s made him eligible for an estimated $68,000 per year for life in state and federal pensions, an income stream worth around $750,000 in all. He owns a five-bedroom, $1 million home outside Seattle.A prosecutor turned politician, Klobuchar holds a plain-vanilla portfolio. Her retirement holdings include a federal pension worth an estimated $560,000, the result of 12 years in the U.S. senate.When the New Jersey senator arrived in Washington in 2013, he owned stock in companies like Netflix, Facebook and Amazon. He sold all of that within a year of taking office, putting the proceeds into checking and savings accounts. Today Booker’s portfolio includes a 2,800-square-foot house in Newark, where he served as mayor from 2006 to 2013, and a New Jersey state pension. His federal tax returns show average annual giving of 11%, higher than any of the other 14 candidates who have released their filings.The governor of Montana is a small-time landlord. He owns 50% of a historic building in Helena, Montana, where he rents out two commercial spaces and one residential apartment. It’s in a convenient location for Bullock, just a mile down the road from his office at the state capitol. His stake is worth roughly $300,000 after debt. The rest of Bullock’s portfolio is mostly composed of retirement accounts.   Williamson made millions as a self-help guru and author (with books like the 1992 bestseller A Return To Love), but she hasn’t held onto most of the money. What she does have sits in mutual funds, money market accounts and cash accounts, along with a handful of publicly traded stocks like Apple, Home Depot and VF Corp. While Williamson is not likely to win the election, she’ll almost certainly make money off her campaign: In April, she released her latest book, A Politics of Love.Gillibrand owns a $350,000 home in Troy, New York, with her husband, Jonathan. She’s the breadwinner, earning $174,000 annually for serving in the senate. He made just $185,000 as a consultant and investor between 2007 and 2018, according to tax returns. Their most valuable asset appears to be Gillibrand’s federal pension, worth an estimated $450,000.Moulton got a physics degree from Harvard, then joined the Marine Corps and served four tours in Iraq. Back Stateside, he used the G.I. Bill to get master's degrees from Harvard’s public policy and business schools, before running for Congress. His $1 million fortune is largely spread among mutual funds, index funds and a 2,750-square-foot condo in Salem, Massachusetts.Joe Biden arrives for a campaign kickoff rally on May 18, 2019 in Philadelphia.The son of Taiwanese immigrants, Yang left a corporate law gig to go into the startup world. In 2000 he cofounded Stargiving.com, a website that gave charitable donors the chance to meet celebrities. After it folded he went to work for small mobile software and healthcare companies, then became CEO of test prep business Manhattan Prep in 2006. Yang helped grow the company to $11 million in revenues before industry giant Kaplan bought it in 2009 for tens of millions.Barack Obama’s former secretary of housing and urban development has more than $100,000 in cash accounts, plus stock in a handful of mutual funds. After Obama left office, Castro joined the faculty of the University of Texas’ school of public affairs. His $40,000-per-year university pension is worth about $110,000. He also owns a modest, 2,000-square-foot home in San Antonio, where he served as mayor from 2009 to 2014.Gabbard invested in the cryptocurrency craze in 2017, buying between $2,000 and $30,000 worth of Litecoin and Ethereum, according to documents she filed with the government. By the time she turned in her most recent financial disclosure report, in July 2019, she had gotten rid of those investments. It’s not clear if she made money on them. Most of her fortune is tied up in an $865,000 home in Washington, D.C., which has an estimated $560,000 in debt against it.Elected to the House of Representatives at 29 years old, Ryan has been earning a congressional salary for years. After getting a law degree in 2000, he briefly served in the Ohio state senate, then won his House seat in 2002. In 2013, Ryan married a public school teacher, who is still paying off her student loans, according to his most recent financial disclosure report. Mayor Pete has enough money to live comfortably in the Midwest, but he’s still the poorest 2020 contender. Chalk that up to his age (at 37, he’s the youngest candidate), student loan debt and his decision to give up a lucrative McKinsey job to run for treasurer of his home state of Indiana in 2010. He lost but got a six-figure gig as mayor of South Bend two years later. Still, he and his husband, Chasten, a former teacher, disclosed between $100,000 and $230,000 in student loans.Get Forbes’ daily top headlines straight to your inbox for news on the world’s most important entrepreneurs and superstars, expert career advice, and success secrets.I am a senior editor at Forbes, as well as the author of White House, Inc.: How Donald Trump Turned the Presidency into a Business, released Sept. 22, 2020.

Symba’s platform connects companies with talented remote interns from around the world and curates meaningful remote internship experiences. Gupta and her co-founder, Ahva Sadeghi, recently closed their first financing round. They learned a lot during the process about how to pitch their mission.“Start with a personal anecdote—paint a picture for your audience,” offers the 2020 30 Under 30 honoree and Cornell University graduate in computer science and engineering. “If you tell a real story about yourself, it makes the pitch more relatable. Be natural and don’t force anything.“Second,” Gupta says, “your audience needs to know you’re the right person to make this idea real. Stress right away that you have the appropriate skill sets and the relevant experience for the job. “Third, if investors don’t understand the problem your idea is intended to solve, your idea isn’t going to make any sense to them.

2,['https://www.forbes.com/sites/servicenow/2020/10/15/using-iot-data-to-drive-customer-satisfaction/'],['ServiceNow BrandVoice: Using IoT Data To Drive Customer Satisfaction'],"[""When the term Internet of Things (IoT) first gained popularity a decade ago, many futurists looked forward excitedly to the commercial and industrial applications of these always-on, always-connected data sources.Today, smart homes and internet-enabled personal devices are ubiquitous and commercially successful, but B2B applications haven’t seen the same success. Vast pools of underutilized IoT data are left to grow stale in organizational silos.It’s little wonder, when one considers the numbers:Nearly 80 zettabytes? That’s 80,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. “We’re building IoT systems that take data from all these devices, and this data is classified as alerts,” or active signals, says Dave Wright, ServiceNow’s chief innovation officer. “The challenge then becomes: What do you do with all of these alerts?”There’s untapped value hidden within these massive data volumes, Wright believes—particularly when IoT data is integrated with a customer service management platform (CSM) using smart workflows. Device data can be analyzed to prioritize service calls, for example, add value to a customer contract, even predict and prevent costly equipment failures.“With the number of connected assets set to increase dramatically,” — an estimated 41.6 billion devices by 2025, according to research — “it’s important that we start to analyze and understand the business context of any given device,” Wright says. “In the world of connected assets, no one has really focused on this before.”Keep reading to learn how connected enterprises use smart workflows to analyze IoT data in real time — and deliver measurable ROI in customer service, field engineering and other mission-critical departments.At first glance, TAPCO may seem like an unlikely source of cutting-edge IoT innovation. Since 1956, the third-generation, family-owned company has been making traffic signs for customers in all 50 states. In fact TAPCO was an early, insightful adopter of IoT.Today, the Wisconsin-based company provides an impressive array of internet-enabled products, including radar-equipped speed limit signs; programmable traffic safety displays; pedestrian crosswalk systems; and Wrong-Way driver alerts, which automatically detect cars driving in the wrong direction.To make better use of these always-on streams of device data, TAPCO’s leadership partnered with ServiceNow to pilot Connected Operations, a new product that uses existing IoT signals for customer support and field service applications.Before Connected Operations, data collected from IoT devices was stored and indexed on their own network and servers. ServiceNow saw opportunities to connect these signals to Customer Service Management (CSM) and Field Service Management (FSM), yielding greater automation and efficiency.Consider the chain of events following an equipment failure. When the solar panel on a speed limit sign fails, for example, a signal is sent to the service center. Before Connected Operations. A human being identified this particular sign and searched through customer records, asking: Is this item under warranty? Does the client have a service contract? How should this ticket be prioritized?Only then is a field service engineer dispatched.Thanks to Connected Operations, much of this process has been automated. Now, a device’s fail signal triggers an automatic search of TAPCO’s equipment records, and all pertinent information is delivered directly to customer service and the remote operations center simultaneously.Now, service decisions are made more quickly and accurately. Downtime is reduced and repairs can cost less. In some cases, issues are resolved even before the customer is aware of the problem.The trial program—currently deployed on TAPCO’s Wrong-Way driver alerts systems—brought greater capabilities to both customer service and field service by creating new, smart workflows that seamlessly pass data and analysis between once-separate departments.“The power it gives us is incredible,” says Jason Anderson, TAPCO’s IT director and member of the executive team.“For us, there was a lot of opportunity to move to a digital workflow,” says Anderson. “Not having to jump back and forth between multiple systems, not having to look up contracts over on this file server, not having to look up the customer contact,” he adds. “All that information is right here, gathered when the alert arrives.”This, says Anderson, has allowed TAPCO to continue serving long-time clients—many relationships go back decades—with cutting-edge, data-driven products featuring greater uptime, lower lifetime costs and greater overall customer satisfaction.TAPCO’s customers are also empowered. Working on a single integrated platform, they can now submit service requests, check a work order status and track new equipment orders. Thanks to these newly unlocked IoT data sources, these benefits are realized in near-real time.“Having a seamless, end-to-end workflow…is a huge efficiency gain for us and our customers,” Anderson says. “Now, we’re making decisions based on real data, instead of gut feelings.”As TAPCO’s experience demonstrates, it’s an exciting time to build more fully connected enterprises that use IoT-based data sources to improve the customer service experience. But this is just the beginning, says ServiceNow’s Dave Wright, who offers three examples of what’s coming across industries in the near future.The Internet of Things has come a long way since the term was first coined in 1999, then popularized in the ‘00s. Tens of billions of devices are already online, and billions more are expected to connect in the next few years.As to the question of what we can do with so much data, Dave Wright is excited to see what comes next — particularly when the use cases are essential to public health .“We've had other companies ask about monitoring wind speeds to decide whether they should shut down amusement park rides,” Wright says. “The level of importance being put on data is very interesting, especially when it might have life-or-death consequences.”ServiceNow is making the world of work, work better for people. Our cloud-based platform and solutions deliver digital workflows that create great experiences and unlock…""]","['68,910 views']",['Innovation'],"['Oct 15, 2020, 09:00am EDT']"

While the transition is likely to increase the operational efficacy of banking and heighten customer experience, it also threatens to expose individuals to privacy and security shortfalls. With banks required to divulge personal financial information, basic protections can no longer be guaranteed. That's where digitally verified self-sovereign IDs come in. The Benefits of Open BankingIt's been one year since the second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) went live. In that time, and despite disruption from covid-19, over two million customers have started using open banking-enabled products. The figure has doubled since January 2020, with a steady uptick of 160,000 users per month.The open banking initiative has unearthed a latent desire in consumers to exercise their data rights, benefiting both themselves and their finances. At the same time, it's expanded the market for finance-touting business models, fostering competition, and allowing small businesses to successfully bid for consumer attention.Open banking represents the interoperability consumers so direly needed. Since its inception, a deluge of apps and tools to manage finances have swamped the market, allowing users a linchpin to their once-segregated banking systems to streamline, organize, and even aggregate separate accounts in a single application.It's not purely accounting-centric either. Open banking has allowed third-party developers to produce a litany of novel offerings such as couponing, rewards and discount apps, credit building apps to help mortgage applicants get off the starting mark, and even cryptocurrency conversion apps allowing token holders to pay in crypto.With banks required to divulge personal financial information, basic protections can no longer be ... [+]Open Banking, Open RiskWhile the benefits of open banking look to keep it in vogue and its adoption rate climbing, privacy, and security drawbacks remain potentially significant. The biggest danger for the banks is they have provided the service as agreed with the regulator, but once beyond their walls, privacy and security can go awry. And that's not good for any of us, customers, or banks.Under open banking regulation, very few safeguards exist to protect customer data should it fall into the wrong hands. For example, malicious actors could effortlessly establish a fintech for the sole purpose of swiping important financial data. Risks also extend to the exploitation of legitimate fintech infrastructure. All it takes is an attack on the central server of one of these fintechs—or even via the app itself—for bad actors to gather what they need to impersonate the users.In addition, many fintech apps still use outmoded and insecure two-Factor authentication  (2FA) in the form of SMS or email to verify transactions, which is no longer fit for purpose. Attacks arising from sim swapping and email hacking can easily circumvent 2FA in its most basic form.But it's the end-user that is at most risk of attack. Phishing emails appearing to be from a third-party provider asking for a password or other pieces of sensitive information could place the user’s data in jeopardy. While many consumers have been conditioned to ignore such communication from banks, apps have a tendency to leverage their mailing lists to push users a new product, service, deal, or even a newsletter. As such, unsuspecting consumers could be caught off guard and unwittingly provide access to malicious actors and hackers.In the same vein, open banking makes it very easy to send the wrong money to the wrong person. Bad actors achieve this via invoice fraud—or sending a payment in response to an email with a sort code and account number.The globalization ushered in under the innovation of open banking also presents a regulatory risk, on a global scale. No longer are due diligence processes limited to one country, language, or regulator. It’s now paramount to have a real-time pan-EEA view of all regulated entities so customer data and financial information can be protected, and the Open Banking ecosystem can operate as intended, in a secure way. That’s where verified digital identities can counter this. Owning Our DataDisclosing financial data was always bound to end in tears. But that doesn't mean it has to stay this way. Instead, consumers and businesses on either side need to control and secure that data themselves. Digitally verified Identity and payment may prove to be the answer here.Harnessing biometrically validated digital IDs underpinned by the immutability of the blockchain and connected to the payment source, not only removes the onus on third party businesses to keep our financial data safe but it can also remove the risk of fraudulent push payments and identity theft. Rather than using the antiquated username and password combination coupled with insecure SMS and email verifications, the customer could frictionlessly tie their digital ID to their bank through apps, platforms, and services—all without intermediaries endangering the customer's privacy and security or indeed that of the bank itself. In turn, the bank can provide the customer with their rightful access to the services and products with confidence. Digitally verified IDs also help mitigate (even eradicate) push payment fraud. With verified IDs on either side of the transaction, payment requests made outside of the established channels cannot and will not be processed.Perhaps most importantly, digital IDs ensure that the person who is logging in is the rightful owner and that the service connecting a user to their bank is doing so in a secure environment. This also caps the chance of data breaches with all information cryptographically secured. Additionally, with the use of technology such as zero-knowledge proofs, the information can be cryptographically proven without revealing any information. Upon exceptional requests or functions from the customer, additional verification can be sought through the digital identity in the form of biometrics, from controlled devices, and or additional biometric verification. Blockchain can also help evolve the system by recording private transactions and activities to inform and reinforce future legitimate interactions and help prevent irregular ones. This will undoubtedly increase the viability and success of open banking, enabling an entire ecosystem of services to securely offer more to consumers and cultivate further innovation within the financial sector—bringing easy privacy, security and peace of mind to both individuals and banks.Alastair, an entrepreneur and innovator, believes the blockchain is about to transform relationships between individuals and institutions they interact with.

Sheth, the co-founder and President of Vista Equity Partners, is leaving the firm after his partner was revealed to be a tax cheat.Perhaps no duo on Wall Street has ever soared higher and broken apart quicker than the partnership between billionaires Robert F. Smith and Brian N. Sheth, the co-founders of Vista Equity Partners. For the past decade, Smith and Sheth towered over Wall Street, as they perfected the software buyout and built Vista into a $73 billion private equity giant with returns to put virtually every competitor to shame. Investors were so enamored with Vista, the privately-held firm was valued by outside parties at $7 billion. As it became the hottest ticket on Wall Street, Smith and Sheth became billionaires many times over. The bond went far beyond making money. They were best friends, vacationing together and regularly fly fishing for trout in streams fed by the Rocky Mountains. It was Smith who introduced Sheth to the world of philanthropy, a passion that now makes him one of the world’s preeminent young conservationists. Sheth was even Smith’s groomsman at his star-studded 2014 wedding to a former Playboy playmate.But as Americans were preparing their turkeys and stuffing for Thanksgiving, Smith and Sheth, and a phalanx of expensive lawyers around the country, were putting the final touches on a hard fought separation that will mean Sheth will leave Vista for good and hand back his minority ownership in the firm, a stake Forbes once valued at over $1 billion. For this, Sheth will retain his valuable cut of Vista’s performance fee earnings, which could be worth billions of dollars a decade from now. Almost as important, he will eventually be freed from the restrictive bonds embedded in Wall Street partnership agreements, and able to make his own name as an investor in the future. The speedy end of the most dynamic tandem on Wall Street this past decade will undoubtedly send shockwaves through the ultra-competitive and lucrative world of buyouts. It is the result of a giant secret that has rocked Austin-based Vista for a year.Smith and Sheth’s partnership was one that pleased investors around the world. Little did anyone know that Smith, America’s wealthiest African American, was even more deeply intertwined with the financial dealings of a third figure, Robert Brockman, the owner of Universal Computer Systems. That discreet partnership, according to prosecutors allegations, went beyond the boundaries of the law and threatened to put both behind bars.In the late 1990s, Smith was Brockman’s banker at Goldman Sachs and witnessed the hidden value in software companies. Brockman seeded Smith as an investor, helping him create Vista. According to the Justice Department, however, their financial arrangement flowed through illegal offshore tax structures in countries like Belize and Switzerland that Brockman had built to evade taxes. For Brockman, the IRS alleges the structure evaded tax on billions of profits that Smith earned from Vista’s investments, and which recently led to his arrest and criminal prosecution. (Brockman’s lawyers maintain his innocence)Robert Smith graced the cover of the Forbes in our 2018 issue of America\'s richest people.Smith is currently a cooperating witness against Brockman after striking a non-prosecution agreement with the DoJ, in which he admitted to tax fraud, evading taxes on hundreds of millions of dollars in investment profits, some which were used to buy a Sonoma estate and a Colorado ski home. The settlement casts a disturbing pall over Smith’s flurry of recent charitable contributions, which have gained worldwide press and inspired millions. According to the DoJ’s statement of facts, millions of untaxed income at the center of the case was used by Smith starting in 2014 to fund some of his philanthropic activities. This was after he became aware of his tax issues. Under the terms of his agreement, Smith will pay approximately $56 million in taxes and penalties on unreported income and another $82 million in penalties stemming from his concealment of his offshore bank accounts. Additionally, he abandoned $182 million in tax refund claims he made with the IRS for his charitable giving.The revelation stunned the world of finance, presenting Smith, an icon in business, in a criminal light. It forever altered the real history behind Smith and Vista’s meteoric rise. And the revelation appears to have ended the relationship between Smith and Sheth.Sheth spoke with Forbes exclusively the night before Thanksgiving, and his 45th birthday, as the final touches of his exit were being signed. Due to the terms of the severance, Sheth spoke with the stiffest of upper lips regarding his departure amid revelations about his former partner and struck an optimistic view of Vista’s future. But his words are clear:The potential there might have been for Sheth, Vista’s most active dealmaker, to take the reins of Vista from Smith until his legal troubles concluded, has passed. And while he will be cheerleading on Vista’s dealmakers from outside the firm, Sheth’s mostly done talking about his former best friend, Robert F. Smith. “It’s Robert’s firm,” says Sheth, “I’m grateful for the opportunity he gave me to do transformational work so early in my career.”During his over two decades at Vista, Sheth transformed from a hungry banker in his mid-twenties hunting for an opportunity, and into a prolific billionaire dealmaker, helping to oversee one of the most active and lucrative firms in the world. Under Sheth’s close day-to-day watch, Vista returned tens of billions of dollars in profits to its investors, and the bounty turned the firm’s co-founders into two of America’s richest investors.“We were able to accomplish amazing things at Vista,” reflects Sheth. About handing over his minority ownership in the firm, he adds. “We’re taking care of and giving an opportunity to the next generation of leadership to step up. From my standpoint, it was really important to give this next generation of folks a great economic incentive to make the next chapter of Vista even more successful than the last twenty-one years.”“Living in Austin, I\'ll see them. We socialize. Our families know each other,” he says wistfully of his former colleagues. “So I\'m excited to continue to, from afar, watch and root them on… We have a huge amount of committed capital. I think they\'ve got an opportunity to continue to prove to folks that they can be great.”When Sheth returns as an investor after taking some time off, he plans to marry his passion of environmentalism and conservation with investing, deploying his skills as a turnaround guru and deal-making visionary on companies’ environmental bottom line. It’s close to Vista’s model, but not enough to encroach on their turf. In recent weeks and months, not only was Sheth working towards an honorable and fair exit from Vista and his ability to continue his career independently, he was fighting for his life. In October, he contracted the Coronavirus, and was hospitalized for a week in Austin and given convalescent blood plasma treatments. “If I didn’t get the care that I got in Austin and I wasn’t lucky enough to have access to great doctors, there’s no doubt I’d be dead right now,” he says. “I’m grateful for so much. It reinforced what’s most important: family, friends and health.”*** Brian Sheth grew up in a Boston suburb reading about Michael Milken and Carl Icahn, the son of working class parents. His father was an immigrant from India while his Irish-Catholic mother was an insurance analyst. From an early age, Sheth was drawn to both technology and Wall Street, a combination that would eventually make him billions. After graduating from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, Sheth headed to San Francisco to be part of the tech investment banking scene, working for infamous investment banker Frank Quattrone. After Quattrone left for Credit Suisse, Sheth needed a new opportunity. A close friend suggested he meet Smith, who was then a rising star technology banker at Goldman. They hit it off immediately. In 1999 Smith left Goldman and soon began recruiting cofounders, like Sheth and a business-school classmate named Stephen Davis, who worked under him at Goldman. When Vista started to take off in the mid-2000s, Smith, an engaging public speaker and embodiment of minority success on Wall Street, became the face of the firm to investors and outside companies. Meanwhile, Sheth was Vista’s grinder at its Austin headquarters as a prolific deal scout and company president, helping to implement its special playbook to help portfolio companies grow. In a 2018 Forbes cover story, we called Vista’s playbook “an in-house McKinsey,” with over 100 best practices distilled to “three to ten pages, with reams of attachments and examples. Printed out, they fill binders. They are stored in a password-protected online library, available only to authorized portfolio company managers.”Their deals were enormously successful. Software has grown from a niche sector with good, but relatively  small returns, to one that as the deals get bigger, so do the payouts. Vista’s exits in recent years have consistently reaped multi-billion dollar profits.Amid the success, their relationship became ironclad: ""When something is happening with our families we are each other\'s first call,"" Sheth told Forbes in 2018. It was Smith who inspired Sheth to set up his Sangreal Foundation focused on wildlife conservation. It has backed Global Wildlife Conservation, a nonprofit Sheth chairs that is working in dozens of countries to save species and habitats.Unbeknownst to many, behind Vista’s roots and Smith’s philanthropy was a deep, troubling secret that would violate any partnership. As Smith’s non-prosecution agreement admitting a statement of facts regarding tax fraud culminated in October, Sheth wanted to give the firm a clean slate. Over an hour-long Zoom call, Sheth and Smith debated who would be in charge of Vista. The sticking point was control, and Smith prevailed.*After the Department of Justice released its charges against Brockman and its non-prosecution agreement with Smith, Sheth learned the full details of their ties. Weeks of negotiations ensued about Sheth’s departure, even as the billionaire was holed up in a hospital room at the Dell Seton Medical Center at The University of Texas in Austin, fighting for his life. (A spokesperson for Smith is adamant that Sheth’s departure had nothing to do with the tax woes.)About whether Smith can reclaim his perch as one America’s pre-eminent businessmen and bastion of the American Dream, Sheth offers the following: “I think more about Vista,” he says, declining to speak further about Smith. “I\'m really proud of how resilient the firm has been. Obviously, it\'s been a tough year for the people who work at Vista and I think they’ve performed incredibly well.”Says Smith in a press release, “I want to thank Brian for his partnership and contributions to Vista’s success – from working together to build an engineered solution to private equity, to establishing a standard of excellence across the Vista ecosystem.”(*This article has been updated.)With past reporting from Nathan Vardi and Sergei KlebnikovI’m a staff writer and associate editor at Forbes, where I cover finance and investing.

Try 3%.SecurityLucky you, to be retiring today, when your retirement assets are so richly valued. But not as lucky as you think. Rich stock and bond prices help only so much.The big question for someone living off savings is how much can be safely pulled out every year. The old rule of thumb was 4%: If you had $1 million in your IRA, you could spend $40,000 the first year and kick up the annual withdrawal just enough to match inflation. At that rate you probably wouldn’t outlive your assets. Such a conclusion could be reached by looking back at stock and bond returns over the past century.But now, with asset prices high? When prices are high, it’s easier for them to fall and harder for them to keep up with the cost of living. That changes everything.We are living in strange times. Yields on bonds are abnormally low—indeed, for safe Treasury bonds, yields scarcely top the rate of inflation. Earnings yields are stocks are abnormally low, too. That is the same as saying that price/earnings ratios are high.Who knows why this is. It could be that investors are irrationally exuberant, or that the globe is awash in savings, or that the Federal Reserve is tossing dollars out of helicopters. Whatever the cause, it complicates the matter of safe withdrawal rates.Stock prices have doubled in the last seven years. That helps, since you will be selling stocks as you age. But it doesn’t leave you in a position to double your spending.To see why, imagine that your sole investment asset is a nice rental property. The real estate generates, say, $30,000 a year of rent after expenses. Suppose that last year the building was worth $500,000 but that now, amidst real estate euphoria, it’s worth $1 million, even though the rental income is no higher. Are you better off?Yes and no. If you are about to sell the building and use the proceeds to acquire a sailboat, you are better off by a factor of two. If, on the other hand, you’re planning to hold onto the real estate and cover living expenses with the income from it, you are no better off at all.A new retiree sitting on a pile of stocks and bonds is midway between those extremes. If your assets need to last you 30 years, but not forever, you are half landlord and half sailor. Like a landlord you are earning a current return on your assets, and that current return drives a lot of your spending power. But you are also, like the sailor, selling off a little of the property every year, and property prices matter for that.In November 2013 the S&P 500 index hovered around 1,800, and index earnings came to $100 for the year. The index has climbed to 3,600 but earnings are down, to an estimated $94 for 2020. That equates to a current earnings yield of 2.6%, down from 5.6% in 2013. The earning power of equity capital is meager, and that makes for meager future returns in the stock market.Yes, earnings will rebound a bit with the arrival of vaccines and the resumption of a normal economy. But they won’t double next year. They will remain small in relation to today’s stock prices.The story is the same in fixed income. Yields on long-term Treasuries (1.6%) are a bit less than half as high as they were seven years ago (3.8%). If you bought some of those bonds in 2013 you’re looking at a handsome gain in their value, but this gain does nothing for the interest coupons on the bonds. If you are trying to live on the interest without dipping into principal, you are no better off.Your IRA statement probably says that you are twice as rich as you were in 2013. Nice, but don’t get carried away. The percentage of the account you can spend annually has gone down. That is the consequence of low bond yields and low stock earnings yields.  What’s a safe withdrawal rate now? That’s a matter of debate. A 3% draw seems defensible; at this level, I think, you can afford to give yourself raises to keep up with the CPI. It’s appropriate for a newly retired 67-year-old who might live to 97, or whose spouse might live until 2050.That is, a $1 million account, somewhat conservatively invested 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds, is good for $2,500 a month to start. If inflation comes to 2%, you can step up to $2,550 a month the second year.You could go higher than 3% if you knew there wouldn’t be any stock market crash early in your retirement, and if you also knew there wouldn’t be any burst of inflation between now and 2050. But you can’t know either of these things.You could also go higher if you were emotionally equipped to cut your spending during a crash in stock or bond prices. Belt-tightening would protect more of your principal from the irrecoverable damage of selling in a down market. Not everyone is so equipped.Related: Expected Returns 2020-2040I aim to help you save on taxes and money management costs.

[+]Hosting soaring prices over the past few weeks, bitcoin (BTC) has returned to the mainstream spotlight lately, at least on some level. The asset’s price recently broke past $19,000, putting it less than $1,000 away from its 2017 all-time high near $20,000. Although the asset has shown substantial upward price movement, the current bullish trend could be topping out, at least in the short term, according to derivatives trader and YouTuber Tone Vays, and Brian Krogsgard, a trader and podcaster.“I’m expecting this bull run to end this month,” Vays told me in a message on November 24, 2020. “It’s possible that it has already just ended, but I’ve been saying for the last ten days or so, that this bull run should end in November or early December, but I’m not expecting a bear market.”[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Bull runs represent periods of time yielding notable upward price action. Runs or trends can rely on context and vary based on different time horizons. Just because an asset may retrace in price for a period of time after an exuberant rally does not necessarily mean the asset has entered a predominantly bearish macro environment.Market prices generally move in waves. In a macro bull market, upswings are often followed by smaller pullbacks, followed by additional larger upswings and smaller pullbacks. Higher highs and higher lows, as chartists say.“I’m expecting either significant consolidation or most likely a pullback to the $14,000 to $15,000 area over the next few months,” Vays explained. “Then, it’ll take another month or two to get back to $20,000, and I am expecting the break of $20,000 around the end of Q1 of next year, so maybe March or April is when I’m expecting the break of the $20,000 area, and then we go up quickly.”Markets, however, move fast sometimes, requiring constant evaluation. “That’s my current outlook, but it can change tomorrow,” Vays noted of his position on bitcoin.Bitcoin’s last all-time high occurred in December 2017, when the asset reached $19,892, based on Coinbase exchange data on TradingView.com. The coin revisited the $19,000 level three years later, reaching $19,468 on November 24, 2020 after more than seven weeks of strong upward price movement, shown via the past seven consecutive green weekly price candles on bitcoin’s chart. Mainstream media outlets, such as CNBC, Reuters and Fox FOXA -0.5% have also jumped on board covering bitcoin’s price recently, giving the blockchain-based asset attention.Overall in 2020, bitcoin has seen significant highs and lows. Between February and March, the asset dropped from $10,500 to $3,860 around Covid-19 news. By May, bitcoin found itself back up past $10,000 once again. The months following yielded relatively sideways price action, leading up to a July breakout.“In my mind, the bitcoin bull run began in July of 2020 with the break of consolidation around $9,200 and confirmed it by holding the 20-week moving average at $10,400 in September,” Krogsgard told me in a message on November 24, 2020.“Many market participants are willing to wait for new highs and price exploration to participate. We have now run very hot, and are due for a substantial mean reversion — which would be a big buy on dip opportunity; the macro environment favors bitcoin greatly.”For bitcoin, all-time high levels past the $20,000 range stand as foreign territory, lacking historical price chart levels from which to base evaluation.“I expect we can see at least one year of price exploration in this cycle, and I want to maintain significant bitcoin exposure at least until $50,000,” Krogsgard noted.Although a number of mainstream financial players have bought into bitcoin this year, such as business intelligence outfit MicroStrategy MSTR +0.4% and its $425 million BTC purchase, some participants still remain opposed to the coin. Peter Schiff has repetitively expressed gold as superior to bitcoin. Warren Buffett has also commented negatively on bitcoin in previous years.Note: This article has been updated, clarifying that weekly candles refer to bitcoin’s price chart.Disclaimer: I actively trade cryptocurrencies, as well as hold a small amount of BTC, ETH, LTC, ZEC, BCH and LINK.I am a full-time writer in the cryptocurrency space, on staff with Cointelegraph.

It’s a small help for retirement account owners who don’t need all the money they’re required to take from their plans each year.Most owners of IRAs and other qualified retirement plans who turn age 72 after 2019 must take RMDs from the accounts beginning in the year they turn 72. Older taxpayers were required to to begin RMDs after turning age 70½. The amount of the RMD each year is based on the account owner’s life expectancy as determined by tables issued by the IRS.The current life expectancy tables had been in place for a while, and average life expectancy had increased over the years. So, in November 2019 the IRS issued proposed regulations with updated life expectancy tables. The IRS issued the final version of the regulations recently. In the proposed regulations it was anticipated that the final regulations would take effect for tax years after 2020. But because retirement plan sponsors and IRA custodians need time to update their systems, the final regulations take effect for calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.The new life expectancy tables use mortality rates anticipated for 2022. The basis for the life expectancies are the 2012 Individual Annuity Mortality Basic Tables adjusted for anticipated mortality improvements.The new tables make modest changes in life expectancy. In the current tables, the life expectancy of a 70-year-old is 27.4. In the new tables, life expectancy increases to 29.1 years. When the proposed regulations were issued, the IRS estimated that the new tables would cause only a 1% increase in an IRA balance at age 90.RMDs are a negative factor for IRA owners who have other income and assets that can be used to maintain their standards of living. Taking RMDs from their traditional IRAs increases their taxable income and income taxes. The RMDs also increase adjusted gross income, which can cause increases in the amount of Social Security benefits that are taxed and the Medicare premium surtax (also known as IRMAA). RMDs also can trigger increases in other taxes or decreases in tax benefits.Under the life expectancy tables, the percentage of the IRA that must be distributed each year increases. So, the tax problems of RMDs can increase over time. That’s why IRA owners who have sufficient income and assets outside their IRAs should consider strategies to reduce future RMDs. They can convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. Or they can take distributions from the IRAs before they are required to and pay the taxes at today’s rates. The after-tax amount can be used to fund life insurance payable to their children, make gifts to their children or other loved ones, or invest in taxable accounts that can be inherited by their children.I discussed in more detail the problems with RMDs and the strategies to avoid them when the proposed regulations were issued.  The IRS said that in the future it anticipated reviewing the life expectancy tables at the earlier of every 10 years or whenever a new study of individual annuity mortality is published.I am the editor of Retirement Watch, a monthly newsletter and web site I founded in 1990.

According to CNBC, “Department stores were already losing customers prior to the pandemic, which accelerated that trend.”During 2020 department stores such as Neiman Marcus, Lord & Taylor and J.C. Penney filed for bankruptcy, and others are vulnerable such as Forever 21, Macy’s, Saks, and Bloomingdales.The first mall to open in the U.S. was the Southdale Center in Edina, Minnesota. The 1.3 million mall opened in 1956 and anchored by Macys and is owned by the largest U.S. mall REIT, Simon Property Group (SPG).This 74-year old mall has seen many cycles, including recessions, high inflation, and now, a global pandemic.As tenants come and go, Simon has been able to retain value of Southdale Center by demolishing a former JC Penney store to construct a $43 million Life Time Fitness store (opened in 2019). Other enhancements to the mall include a RH (Restoration Hardware) store and Shae Shack.Simon also constructed luxury apartments on the property and is currently building a new library (set to open in 2022).While Southdale Center is likely to survive COVID-19, many malls across the country are turning into flea markets, like the one in my hometown of South Carolina. I wrote a Forbes article in April explaining that “the coronavirus is killing my hometown mall”. I went onto explain,“The coronavirus has forced all of these stores to temporarily shut - and some businesses will likely suffer indefinitely, never reopening again. I would imagine many of the tenants, especially the mom-and-pop owners, are not going to be able to pay CBL rent with their stores sitting shut. And that could hurt CBL on its mortgage payments.”More recently CBL has filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in order to reduce around $1.5 billion of debt. At the time of the filing, CBL has around $258 million of cash.On the recent Q3-20 earnings the company said it was handing the keys back to its lender for malls located in Forsyth, IL, Little Rock, AR, Cincinnati, OH, and Asheville, NC.In another Forbes article last April I explained That “with roughly 1,100 shopping malls across the U.S., America was already over-retailed, even prior to the coronavirus. The demise of many of these centers was already inevitable. Now, that will only be accelerated.” I added,“We anticipate a bloodbath. With a situation so unprecedented, it’s hard to make much of a prediction beyond that.”Now add another bankruptcy to the mix.On November 1st, Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (PEI) filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy to implement a prepackaged financial restructuring plan.It just doesn’t look good…Within our Mall REIT coverage spectrum, we track eight companies that include·        Simon Property Group·        Taubman Centers TCO 0.0% ·        Macerich MAC -0.7% ·        Tanger Factory Outlet SKT +0.2% ·        Washington Prime Group WPG -4.5% ·        Pennsylvania REIT ·        CBL & Associates ·       Brookfield Property REIT All of the mall REITs, except for Brookfield Property REIT (BPYU) has either cut or suspended its dividend. As illustrated below, all of the mall REITs are trading at substantial discounts:Mall REITsThe Mall REITs have returned an average of -42.7 percent year-to-date, although shares have rallied over the last few weeks to the prospects of the vaccine for COVID-19 (mall REITs were +22 percent over the last 30 days):Mall REIT PerformanceWe maintain a Speculative Strong Buy for Simon Properties SPG -1.9%, and we were happy to ess that a few days ago, the dominant mall REIT announced an agreement to revise its merger deal price (lower), with Taubman Centers.The two REITs were in a lawsuit and Simon was able to re-trade the deal that resulted in a new price of $43/sh, or 18 percent below the prior agreement of $52.50/sh ($1 billion below the previously announced merger price).Simon’s scale advantage ($52 billion enterprise value) and fortress balance sheet (A rated by S&P) provide the dominating mall REIT with wide moat advantages that should enable the company to navigate the pandemic.The average mall REIT is expected to see earnings (or funds from operations) decline by around 44 percent in 2020; however, Simon is forecasted to decline by half of that amount, or -22 percent.Meanwhile, Simon is forecasted (by analysts) to recover to normalized 2015 FFO per share levels by the end of 2022, while other mall REITs – like CBL and PEI – are forecasted to erode in value as more malls shutter.The future does not look bright for malls across America, unless you’re the landlord in strong market…like Edina, Minnesota.I own shares in SPG, SKT, and BPYUBrad Thomas currently writes weekly for Forbes.com and Seeking Alpha where he maintains “real time” REIT research on many publicly-listed REITs.

High volume days are important clues on what big investors are thinking as these investors utilize them to shift their portfolios. What did today tell us? The value catch trade is a global phenomenon just as the growth outperformance over the last decade has been a global phenomenon. The 50 stock Hang Seng Index was up today masking an ugly day as the 400+ stock Hang Seng Composite was down -0.69% and the Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong within the MSCI MSCI -0.4% China All Shares Index were down -1.36%.

Helping value stocks are rumors that HSBC’s dividend could be reinstated.Hong Kong volume leaders were Tencent, which fell -1.88% and had a rare selling day by Mainland investors via Southbound Connect, Xiaomi, which was off -3.68%, Alibaba BABA -0.4% Hong Kong, which dropped -1.11%, Meituan, which fell -3.23%, Ping An, which rose +2%, HSBC, which gained +6.54%, Hong Kong Exchanges, which fell -2.3%, BYD, which was off -3.55% and AIA, which rose +0.74%. Shanghai and Shenzhen were off -1.19% and -1.74% respectively despite Premier Li’s positive statements about the economy during the “1+6” Roundtable with the World Bank, WTO, OECD, Financial Stability Board, and IMF. Not helping growth stocks was India increasing the number of banned Chinese apps, including Alibaba’s international e-commerce unit. Growth names and YTD outperformers, which tend to be mid and small caps, were off on profit-taking. Concerns that President Trump will not go gentle into the night had technology stocks off on concerns that the technology ban could be expanded. A smaller EV player is falling under regulator scrutiny, leading to all things auto being taken to the woodshed on profit-taking. Foreign investors got in on the value rotation with net buying of Shanghai stocks while Shenzhen stocks were sold for an outflow of -$238mm via Northbound Connect. CNY was stable overnight. JD.com Hong Kong was off overnight despite progress on its JD Health spin-off IPO making progress. The company will sell 381mm shares between HKD 62.80 and HKD 70.58, which would raise around HKD 3.5B.

And if you catch them just as they start their next leg up, you’ll line yourself up for big gains (and dividends!).I’ve found relative strength to be a potent strategy when it comes to timing the purchases of dividend stocks. With many income investors fishing in the same pond for payouts, identifying yield plays before the herd turns their attention to a particular sector often results in extra profits.Mid-Cap Stocks: The Perfect Buys for 2021We’ve got a nice “relative strength” play setting up in mid-cap stocks (those with market caps between $2 billion and $10 billion). I expect mid-caps to crush the S&P 500 in 2021—a year that’s already setting up to be the opposite of 2020, with two (and likely more) vaccines on the way and a settled presidential election delivering a level of certainty we haven’t seen in a long time.Here’s why I’m bullish on mid-caps: if you look at the performance of the benchmark SPDR S&P 400 MidCap ETF Trust (MDY) MDY +0.2%, you might conclude that mid-caps are losers: MDY lags the S&P 500 this year—by quite a lot.But look at the end of that chart—you can see mid-caps’ “relative strength” kicking in—they’ve crushed the big names in just about every shorter timeframe you can think of: five days, one month, three months, six months. It isn’t even close!That makes now a great time to add to your portfolio’s mid-cap holdings. Here are three stocks that could be a great fit for you now:A Mid-Cap ETF Pick That Grows Its PayoutBecause midcaps can be tough for individual investors to get good info on, buying through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) can make sense. A good option is the ProShares S&P MidCap 400 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (REGL) REGL -0.5%. The fund, like all ETFs, is run by an algorithm, which is one reason why I prefer to buy through closed end funds (CEFs) or to pick up mid-caps individually. But if you’re going the ETF route, REGL has some key advantages: for one, it yields 2.2%, nearly double MDY’s 1.2% yield and well above the S&P 500 average of 1.6%.You’re also assured of dividend growth: as REGL’s name implies, it follows the mid-cap “dividend aristocrats.” This group is different than the large cap Dividend Aristocrats you likely know. For one, the mid-cap versions have raised their payouts for 15 straight years, as opposed to 25 for the big names (this makes sense, as mid-caps tend to be younger than blue chips).The upshot is that this focus on dividend growers—and dividend payers—results in a more stable fund than MDY, or even an S&P 500 index fund: REGL’s five-year “beta” rating is 0.87, making it 13% less volatile than the S&P 500.That’s very rare among ETFs that focus on smaller stocks. And you’re not trading performance to get that stability: REGL is also showing relative strength versus the S&P 500, especially since the summer!All of this makes REGL a strong choice among ETFs. But don’t buy in just yet, because we can do a lot better if we buy our mid-caps “direct.”2 Mid-Caps That Are Better Buys Than ETFs, Grow Payouts 150%+Even though REGL isn’t my favorite option for mid-cap buying, we shouldn’t toss it out. Instead, let’s cherry-pick its portfolio for strong dividend payers. Two leap out:CONTRARIAN OUTLOOKBefore we go further, let’s address the one thing that’s likely screaming at you from the chart above right now: both stocks’ low current yields.Don’t let that put you off, because the two columns after the dividend yield tell the real story: both stocks’ dividends are way below my “safety line” of 50% of free cash flow (FCF). So they could goose their payouts by a lot—Carlisle Companies (CSL), in fact, could double its dividend tomorrow and the payout would still be safe!Second, both have incredible dividend-growth records that will help you build up your yield on cost fast. If you’d bought Graco GGG +0.4% Inc. (GGG) a decade ago, you’d be yielding 5.8% on your buy today, nearly four times the stock’s current yield.Carlisle? Because it’s more than tripled its payout in that time, you’d be looking at a 5.6% payout—almost six times what the stock pays today.And how’s this for relative strength? Carlisle and Graco have crushed MDY and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) SPY +0.3% in the last three months. That’s a strong sign that now is a good time to buy.These companies’ strong runs are likely just beginning, demand for their products—Graco provides gear for spraying coatings, paint and lubricants, while Carlisle sells engineered components to the construction, aerospace and automotive industries, among others—will likely pick up as more stimulus spending (a certainty—both parties have much to gain from sending out more checks to citizens) and vaccines give companies the certainty they need to unleash the record $1.9 trillion of cash they’re hoarding.No wonder analysts have called for big earnings-per-share gains for both Graco and Carlisle (13% and 30%, respectively) in 2021. Now is a good time to buy as rising profits build on both companies’ relative strength—and push their shares higher.Brett Owens is chief investment strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

We seek to collect them using proven income strategies.Dividend stock investing isn’t easy, even though it looks so on the surface. (Find a high yield, and buy it!) We’ve all had our heart broken by one or more “disappearing” dividend payers in the past. These delinquents are the reason we place such a premium on dividend security.One secure-looking strategy is (unfortunately) known as dividend capture. I don’t like the name because it sounds like something we should be interested in. I don’t like the approach itself because it doesn’t really work.The theory seems innocent enough:Let’s take Verizon VZ +0.3% (VZ), which is a stock that investors buy primarily for its 4.1% dividend. Its most recent ex-dividend date was October 8. (This means that anyone who held VZ shares when the market opened this day would receive its $0.627 quarterly payout.)Knowing that stocks tend to appreciate in anticipation of their ex-date, we could have attempted to “capture” the dividend by purchasing VZ on October 1 and holding the stock until mid-month.The S&P 500 happened to appreciate 3.1% during these 15 days, so we’d expect to have pocketed the payout with a bit of price appreciation to boot. Unfortunately, VZ dropped 1.1%!The above attempt wasn’t a complete disaster. Unless we project it out over a year and see that it puts us on pace to lose more than 26% annually. But I digress…Really, it’s about the timing of the purchase. Let’s look at ExxonMobil XOM -1.5% (XOM), which (let’s be honest) is these days the portfolio property of only income investors and degenerate gamblers. A dividend capture attempt of XOM’s most recent November 10 dividend would have worked out much better than with Verizon.Of course, the S&P 500 rocketed 9.7% higher over these 15 days, so that helped. XOM itself is still down 42% year-to-date, so any attempt to capture its dividend is likely outperforming its poor “buy and hope” investors!My VZ and XOM examples are, obviously, purely arbitrary and for educational and entertainment purposes only. That said, how do we find more 12% winners and fewer 1% losers?I’ll share a couple actionable income ideas with you in a moment. Neither has anything to do with ex-dividend dates, or capture of any sort.Why not? Because there’s no alpha available in a strategy this simple. How many supercomputers on Wall Street do we believe are mining for these ex-dates and any potential “blip” worth buying? Enough to act faster than you, me and our slow human brains, that is for sure.But we have an edge over the computers when we logically think a few steps ahead. Here’s an example. Drug distributor AmerisourceBergen ABC +0.1% (ABC) is bizarrely cheap at 11-times free cash flow (FCF). This is a company that has increased its dividend by 29% over the last five years!ABC, its two main competitors, and Johnson & Johnson JNJ +0.2% (JNJ) are being sued by 21 states. Hence, the discounted stock price.But the four firms have recently tentatively agreed to settle for $26 billion. This may sound huuuuge, but because it is actually less than the market feared, it likely boosted ABC’s stock price to help it catch up with its “dividend magnet.”Could we try to capture ABC’s next dividend payment in February? Sure, but I’d rather buy it here because it’s likely to be trading higher by the time it dishes its next dividend!Our next “special dividend situation” comes courtesy of an upcoming spinoff. Spinoff companies tend to be great deals for investors. It’s rare that we income investors get to enjoy one!Michigan-based utility DTE DTE -2.8% Energy (DTE) is spinning off its midstream business, which moves and stores natural gas. The spin is scheduled to happen in mid-2021.We could attempt to capture DTE’s next dividend by buying shares before December 18. But I’m concerned that they’ll be more expensive then than they are now as other income investors figure out that:Over the past five years, DTE has been no slouch when it comes to dividend growth. The utility has boosted its payout by a sweet 49%, more than four times the raise received by mainstream investors who only invest in the “utes” with the mainstream Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU) XLU -1%.Since 2009, DTE’s boosted its payout by 6.2% annually—so the spinoff will represent an acceleration of this already excellent trend. The company anticipates shareholders will receive a combined dividend of $4.34 next year (a 7% increase from 2020) with an even more generous raise coming in 2022:DTE’s Dividend: Past, Present and FutureDTE ENERGYIn this zero-point-nothing interest rate world, what’s not to like about a steady 3.2% payer with a proven catalyst (the spinoff) for price upside?Brett Owens is chief investment strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Can you still be “American” while living outside the US?The answer would, of course, depend on how one defines “American.” If you believe that to be American you must physically live within the geographical political boundaries of the USA, then the answer is simple: if you live anywhere that is not within the physical boundaries of the United States, then by definition, irrespective of how you act, you are no longer American, even though you keep your US citizenship, vote in US elections, pay US taxes, etc.I don’t believe that.Expats in MexicoAnd, according to my reading of the Declaration of Independence, the Founders of the US didn’t believe that, either. The Declaration of Independence (and what is more “American” than the Declaration of Independence?) begins with universal principles, not in any way subject to geography.If you haven’t read the Declaration recently, it’s worth a refresher in that even the first several sentences are arguably the most brilliant universal political statements ever made.“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”Does this statement contain anything about geography? If so, I missed it.Then if geography doesn’t define what it is to be American, what does?Jet Metier and Chuck Bolotin with Mexican children at Festival of the Virgin of GuadalupeI believe to be American is defined by the American attitude, American values and American culture identified by the Declaration and then infused into and consistent with how it is to “act American.” If one believes and acts according to the principles of the Declaration, then one is “American” in the way that matters—how they are as a person — regardless of where they are physically located.In the four and a half years we have lived in Mexico, we have, of course, seen how those from the US interact with the local Mexicans. I must admit that, before witnessing this myself, I had some trepidations about how “we” would act. Thankfully, this was a fear that was wholly unwarranted.Almost without exception, we have never seen an “Ugly American”; quite the contrary. Seeing how Americans in Mexico act has made us extremely proud to be Americans. Americans who live in Mexico are almost without exception kind, gracious, and extremely beneficial to the locals, volunteering and helping out everywhere. We have Americans donating libraries, building schools, helping the handicapped, etc.  You can be proud of how “America” is represented by the actions of people who came from the US to live in Mexico and how Americans are viewed by the locals.Jet Metier with young Mexican man in Mexico with Philippines t-shirtWhy Americans act this way can be found in the universal values in the Declaration and lived by generations of Americans after that, whether American because they were born in the United States, or because they came to the US looking for a better life, i.e., to a place that is governed by the principles stated in the Declaration. And it’s not just that some men created the Declaration of Independence and then forced everyone to abide by it; the Founders were just stating what they believed to be true and the rest of us used the gift of this construct to build a country and a culture around those principles, imperfectly, of course, but different from how other countries built theirs.What happened to this construct of the American way of acting? It created an American character that was shared by many (but not all) living within the physical boundaries of the US, and the value of this construct also spread to other places not within the physical boundaries of the US.  In places that do not have the American way of acting as described by the Declaration of Independence, their people have seen what “acting American” can achieve, and they want it, too.Jet Metier at the beach in Mexico with friendly localsIn the roughly one year we spent traveling through Mexico and afterwards, we have been fortunate to interact with lots of local Mexicans, including a young Mexican man and his wife who ran a tiny roadside carwash in an out-of-the-way village in Baja California Sur, about an hour from La Paz. As this young man explains in the video, he has three jobs: he manages a restaurant, helps his wife in their local bakery, and he has the car wash, of which he is the founder, CEO, Chairman of the Board, and along with some part time help from his wife, the only worker. When I asked him which of his three jobs he liked best, without a second of hesitation, he told me he liked the car wash the best. When I asked him off camera why, he told me because the car wash was the one in which he was working for himself and the one in which he had the chance, if he worked hard and provided a good service to his clients, to build into something more.Mexican car wash owner in Baja CaliforniaSo who is more “American” in his attitude and values, this young Mexican man who has three jobs and treasures the most the job where he created his own business, or, for example, a young man of the same age born and living in the US who plays video games all day in a room at his parent’s house and complains that others are not doing enough for him?In my view, the Mexican business-owner is more “American.” He is not waiting for others to help him or blaming his circumstances on anyone. He is self-reliant, works hard, and the only time he asks for money from others is after he provides them a service. Could it be that this Mexican is pursuing the American dream? I would say definitely “yes”, the same as my ancestors who came to America and made me “American.” All he or they asked was for the freedom to work hard at whatever they wished and keep enough of what they created to build a better life.So, does our client have to worry that he is no longer American just because he lives in Mexico? I don’t think so. I just think he has to explain the idea of “America” to his son, without the map.In 2016, my wife and I decided to try life abroad; selling, giving away, or putting into storage anything that wouldn’t fit into a large, white van, in which we and our']","['2,516 views']",['Retirement'],['https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckbolotin/2020/11/27/can-you-be-american-while-living-in-mexico/']

But how about the 25 people jockeying to replace him as president? Forbes dug into the details—examining financial disclosure statements, scouring local real estate records and calculating pension benefits—to figure out the finances of the 2020 candidates.There were some surprises. Bernie is a millionaire. So is “middle-class Joe” Biden. Elizabeth Warren is richer than both of them, worth an estimated $12 million. But she’s a long way from John Delaney, whose $200 million fortune makes him twice as wealthy as every other Democratic candidate not named Tom Steyer or Michael Bloomberg.Aside from Trump, Steyer and Bloomberg, the average net worth is $12.9 million—the same as it was for the 2016 contenders. The median net worth is $2 million. The poorest is Pete Buttigieg, who has an estimated $100,000—or about 0.003% of Trump’s fortune.We reached out to the candidates. No one, not even the Democrats who spend the most time bashing Trump for his financial dealings, answered every question. So we ranked the entire field on transparency, assigning scores ranging from 0 (lips sealed) to 5 (full disclosure). In the end, we uncovered the money, regardless of whether the candidates wanted it out in the open.In November, former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg joined a dozen other Democrats aiming to unseat Donald Trump. He has the money to compete, thanks to an 88% stake in financial information company Bloomberg LP, which generates an estimated $10 billion in annual revenue and throws off piles of cash. Bloomberg used $250 million of his own money running for mayor three times, and he has funneled $8 billion into philanthropic and activist causes, including fighting climate change and guns.The billionaire-in-chief is rich enough to fund his entire presidential campaign by himself. Not that he will. While donors around the country have been pitching in to support his reelection effort, the richest president in American history has donated exactly $0 of his own, according to the latest filings.After years of backing other Democrats, the hedge funder is trying his own luck as a candidate. Money won’t be an issue. Steyer founded Farallon Capital in 1986 and turned it into one of the largest hedge fund firms in the country. He stepped back in 2012 to focus on politics and philanthropy, concentrating his early efforts on protecting the environment. That struck some people as odd, given that he had previously invested in the fossil-fuel industry. Oil tycoon Harold Hamm, a prominent Trump supporter, once called Steyer “the world’s biggest hypocrite.” For his part, Steyer said he had a change of heart and divested his old fossil-fuel holdings.Delaney made a fortune in the business world before serving three terms in Congress. The son of a union electrician, he launched HealthCare Financial Partners, a lender to health care businesses, in 1993. One of his major backers: Tom Steyer, whose hedge fund invested $25 million. Delaney took HealthCare Financial Partners public in 1996 and pocketed $30 million when he sold it three years later to Heller Financial (later rolled into GE Capital). He quickly founded a second company, commercial lender CapitalSource, raising $542 million to launch it—$190 million of it from Steyer’s firm.The Democratic senator got millions working for Republican megadonor Philip Anschutz. After serving in the Justice Department during the Clinton administration, Bennet left Washington in 1997 to join the Anschutz Investment Company. There, he worked on a deal to merge three movie theater chains into Regal Entertainment Group and ultimately joined its board of directors. Today his assets include hedge fund holdings and Colorado real estate.Teachers aren’t paid so poorly after all—at least not Harvard professors. Warren and her husband, Bruce Mann, both longtime instructors at the university, have built up a small fortune through years of teaching, writing and consulting. Their largest holdings include TIAA and CREF accounts—available to educators and nonprofit employees—worth more than $4 million. One of their best investments has been their home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, purchased in 1995 for $447,000. It’s now worth an estimated $3 million.“Middle-class Joe” is now solidly upper class. The former vice president and his wife, Jill, earned more than $15 million in the two years after they left the White House, cashing in on a multi-book deal with publisher Flatiron. In 2017, they dropped $2.7 million on a 4,800-square-foot pad in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. The next year, they paid off a mortgage on their other home, in Wilmington, Delaware.Senator Harris married lawyer Douglas Emhoff in 2014, creating a California power couple. She brought the clout, and he brought the money. Since then, they have raked in $8.2 million—most of it from Emhoff’s work at law firms Venable and DLA Piper. The couple owns homes in Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco, worth a combined $5.8 million before debt.Sestak graduated second in his class at the U.S. Naval Academy in 1974 and retired as a three-star admiral three decades later. For his service, he gets roughly $120,000 every year for the rest of his life. That pension is worth nearly $1.5 million. Sestak has funneled his salary into a diversified portfolio, which includes more than $15,000 of Apple stock and at least $100,000 in Amazon shares.The former Texas congressman married into a rich family—his wife, Amy, is the daughter of an El Paso real estate tycoon—but only a small chunk of that wealth has trickled down to the couple. Their largest asset is a note held by Amy, worth $2.5 million, according to a campaign spokesperson. Beto holds a minority interest in a $2.5 million El Paso strip mall, which he got from his mother.Elizabeth Warren announces her bid for president on Feb. 9, 2019 in Lawrence, Massachusetts.Mayor Bill de Blasio has spent most of his life in public service, but like the Oval Office occupant he hopes to replace, he owes his fortune to timely investments in New York City real estate. In 2000 de Blasio, who held a handful of city and federal jobs before being elected mayor, and his wife bought a 1,200-square-foot row house on a quiet Brooklyn block. Four years later, they picked up a 1,600-square-footer just down the road. Since then, real estate values have skyrocketed. Last year de Blasio collected $108,450 by renting out the two properties while he and his family live in Gracie Mansion, the mayor’s official residence.Turns out, the socialist senator is a pretty successful capitalist. After running for president in 2016, Sanders inked three lucrative book deals that have brought him more than $2 million so far, catapulting him into the 1%. Since the 2016 election, he has shelled out $575,000 for a northern Vermont summer home and paid off a 30-year mortgage on his Burlington, Vermont, house—25 years early.Since 1988, Inslee has bounced back and forth between the Washington state government (serving as a legislator and now governor) and the federal government (representing Washington’s 4th district, then its 1st district). That’s made him eligible for an estimated $68,000 per year for life in state and federal pensions, an income stream worth around $750,000 in all. He owns a five-bedroom, $1 million home outside Seattle.A prosecutor turned politician, Klobuchar holds a plain-vanilla portfolio. Her retirement holdings include a federal pension worth an estimated $560,000, the result of 12 years in the U.S. senate.When the New Jersey senator arrived in Washington in 2013, he owned stock in companies like Netflix, Facebook and Amazon. He sold all of that within a year of taking office, putting the proceeds into checking and savings accounts. Today Booker’s portfolio includes a 2,800-square-foot house in Newark, where he served as mayor from 2006 to 2013, and a New Jersey state pension. His federal tax returns show average annual giving of 11%, higher than any of the other 14 candidates who have released their filings.The governor of Montana is a small-time landlord. He owns 50% of a historic building in Helena, Montana, where he rents out two commercial spaces and one residential apartment. It’s in a convenient location for Bullock, just a mile down the road from his office at the state capitol. His stake is worth roughly $300,000 after debt. The rest of Bullock’s portfolio is mostly composed of retirement accounts.   Williamson made millions as a self-help guru and author (with books like the 1992 bestseller A Return To Love), but she hasn’t held onto most of the money. What she does have sits in mutual funds, money market accounts and cash accounts, along with a handful of publicly traded stocks like Apple, Home Depot and VF Corp. While Williamson is not likely to win the election, she’ll almost certainly make money off her campaign: In April, she released her latest book, A Politics of Love.Gillibrand owns a $350,000 home in Troy, New York, with her husband, Jonathan. She’s the breadwinner, earning $174,000 annually for serving in the senate. He made just $185,000 as a consultant and investor between 2007 and 2018, according to tax returns. Their most valuable asset appears to be Gillibrand’s federal pension, worth an estimated $450,000.Moulton got a physics degree from Harvard, then joined the Marine Corps and served four tours in Iraq. Back Stateside, he used the G.I. Bill to get master's degrees from Harvard’s public policy and business schools, before running for Congress. His $1 million fortune is largely spread among mutual funds, index funds and a 2,750-square-foot condo in Salem, Massachusetts.Joe Biden arrives for a campaign kickoff rally on May 18, 2019 in Philadelphia.The son of Taiwanese immigrants, Yang left a corporate law gig to go into the startup world. In 2000 he cofounded Stargiving.com, a website that gave charitable donors the chance to meet celebrities. After it folded he went to work for small mobile software and healthcare companies, then became CEO of test prep business Manhattan Prep in 2006. Yang helped grow the company to $11 million in revenues before industry giant Kaplan bought it in 2009 for tens of millions.Barack Obama’s former secretary of housing and urban development has more than $100,000 in cash accounts, plus stock in a handful of mutual funds. After Obama left office, Castro joined the faculty of the University of Texas’ school of public affairs. His $40,000-per-year university pension is worth about $110,000. He also owns a modest, 2,000-square-foot home in San Antonio, where he served as mayor from 2009 to 2014.Gabbard invested in the cryptocurrency craze in 2017, buying between $2,000 and $30,000 worth of Litecoin and Ethereum, according to documents she filed with the government. By the time she turned in her most recent financial disclosure report, in July 2019, she had gotten rid of those investments. It’s not clear if she made money on them. Most of her fortune is tied up in an $865,000 home in Washington, D.C., which has an estimated $560,000 in debt against it.Elected to the House of Representatives at 29 years old, Ryan has been earning a congressional salary for years. After getting a law degree in 2000, he briefly served in the Ohio state senate, then won his House seat in 2002. In 2013, Ryan married a public school teacher, who is still paying off her student loans, according to his most recent financial disclosure report. Mayor Pete has enough money to live comfortably in the Midwest, but he’s still the poorest 2020 contender. Chalk that up to his age (at 37, he’s the youngest candidate), student loan debt and his decision to give up a lucrative McKinsey job to run for treasurer of his home state of Indiana in 2010. He lost but got a six-figure gig as mayor of South Bend two years later. Still, he and his husband, Chasten, a former teacher, disclosed between $100,000 and $230,000 in student loans.Get Forbes’ daily top headlines straight to your inbox for news on the world’s most important entrepreneurs and superstars, expert career advice, and success secrets.I am a senior editor at Forbes, as well as the author of White House, Inc.: How Donald Trump Turned the Presidency into a Business, released Sept. 22, 2020.

Apple spun the move as a goodwill gesture to support small businesses during Covid. But the truth is, it is just a sugar-coated concession.A few months ago, I wrote about brewing backlash against Apple’s monopoly in iPhone apps. I predicted that Apple would eventually give in to get lawmakers off its back. Turns out, it didn’t take long for that to happen.The move itself is not a biggie in terms of lost sales. But it tips off coming challenges for Apple’s most lucrative business—one that Apple’s stock price largely hangs on.I’ll tell you all about it in a moment, but first some background.Today services are Apple’s biggest moneymakerAs I’ve written in Meanwhile in Markets, iPhone is no longer Apple’s biggest moneymaker. Today, Apple’s suite of services—such as Apple Music, iCloud, and the App Store—earn more money than any other Apple product ever has.Here’s a breakdown of Apple\'s profits from last quarter:Apple\'s (AAPL) gross profit from services and productsIn Q2 2020, Apple’s services pulled in a record $9.7 billion. By my calculations, that’s 23% more than its once crown jewel, iPhone, made during the same time. And services are on track to earn more money than all Apple’s products. Combined!There are many reasons Apple pulled such phenomenal growth in services. But by far the biggest was the way its phones are made.How Apple used an OS monopoly to build its services empireEven as Apple’s phone sales are falling, iPhone remains the world’s best-selling phone. A billion people across the world carry an iPhone.But, unlike any other phone, Apple’s phone purposefully runs on a closed operating system (OS). That means Apple holds 100% control over its software—which lets it pull the strings on how a billion people use their phones in a number of ways.For starters, Apple doesn’t allow iPhone users to get apps from anywhere except its own App Store. And there, Apple dictates everything, including which apps (and competitors) make it to the store.For example, Apple recently denied Microsoft’s MSFT +0.6% xCloud gaming app from joining the App Store. Considering that Apple launched its own gaming service Apple Arcade last year, its motives here are murky.Then, Apple pre-packages iPhones with its own apps and services. Some of them come as hard-coded default options, which, until very recently, iPhone users couldn’t swap out with competing apps.And last, Apple slams an “Apple tax” of 15-30% on every dollar app makers earn from iPhone users. This fee gives Apple’s services an upper hand to undercut and otherwise restrain competition.In a picture, Apple’s OS monopoly looks like this:Infographic: Apple\'s OS monopoly in a nutshellAn “anti-Apple” coalition of app makers is rising upFor years, Apple successfully got away with its predatory practices. But one after another, app makers have risen up.It all started with Spotify (SPOT). Last year, the world\'s biggest music streamer sued Apple for using its App Store fees to undercut its service with Apple Music.Earlier this year, Apple came under fire again. After Epic Games started charging its customers directly to avoid Apple’s fees, Apple took down its blockbuster game Fortnite. In response, Epic Games filed an antitrust suit and started a fierce “anti-Apple” social media campaign.Then in late September, Epic Games, Tinder maker Match Group MTCH +0.4%, and Spotify formed the “Coalition for App Fairness.” A quickly growing antitrust group has united dozens of app makers to push for increased regulation over app stores.These are just a few names of those who\'ve taken action.There are many, many more tech companies who have roasted Apple for its app practices. The list includes Wordpress maker Automattic, and Airbnb, as well as the tech giants Microsoft and Facebook.Apple has long defended its policies and denied allegations, but it all changed this year.Apple is quietly throwing in the towelThis past November, Apple rolled out the latest update to its iPhone’s OS, iOS14. During the keynote, presenters touted many new features, but they glossed over the most important “update.”For the first time, Apple has cracked open its operating system. Apple now allows iPhone users to swap default Apple apps for mail and browsing. Apple will also play music from third-party music streamers like Spotify on its HomePods.And now, there’s this overhaul of App Store fees. Starting next year, Apple will slash its App Store commission in half for app makers that earn less than a million dollars per year.Of course, it was a calculated move to earn goodwill. The price cut affects 98% of app makers. But a SensorTower analysis found that Apple stands to lose only 5% of its App Store sales from it.It’s hard to tell how lawmakers will respond in the end. But the fact is, Apple wouldn’t sweat without a reason. This backdown signals that potential antitrust action is a serious threat. And every investor should take it as such.Keep a close watchNow, don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying Apple’s services are doomed. So far, these concessions have had a minimal effect on Apple’s business. But the mere fact that Apple is caving in is a red flag.As iPhone sales are falling, investors are banking on the explosive growth of Apple’s services. The App Store is by far the biggest moneymaker on this side of Apple’s empire. But with so much regulatory pressure, its growth hangs in the air.Not to mention, Apple might lose more of the “privileges” (like default apps) that gave its services a big leg up over competition.If Apple stock is on your watch list, keep a close eye on Apple\'s antitrust war with regulators and app makers. Any ruling or other barrier to the growth of Apple’s most lucrative business could heavily weigh on the stock.Stay ahead with ""big picture"" market insights you won’t find elsewhereEvery week, I put out a story that explains what’s driving the markets.

There can be some major benefits to rolling your 401(k) plan into your IRA, but individual circumstances may vary and you should make sure the rollover option is right for you.Upon separation of service or retirement, most people roll their 401(k) plans over to an IRA to take advantage of the increased investment options and control over their investment account. Many 401(k) plans offer limited investment options that make it difficult to target specific sectors or asset classes of the market. Employees of small or midsized companies are also very susceptible to having only high cost and underperforming funds in their lineup. The lack of investment options is especially pronounced on the bond funds offered for their investments. Another reason to take advantage of rolling a 401k to an IRA upon separation of service is to consolidate all your former employer’s 401(k)s into one IRA account. If you change jobs frequently, you could have numerous 401(k) accounts and various custodians. Rolling them over to a single IRA can help you get a better overall picture of your asset allocation, and prevent you from having to remember multiple account logins.There are other benefits when it comes time to take distributions from your retirement account. 401(k)s often have rules in place limiting when you can take a distribution. A large portion of plans require that you take your withdrawals in regularly scheduled installments, such as monthly or quarterly. Some are even more severe and require an “all or nothing” distribution. 401(k)s also require a 20% Federal withholding amount for federal taxes. IRAs offer much more flexibility on your federal withholding, and although it is generally advised to withhold an amount that would match your federal income tax bracket, you are not required to withhold anything.On the flip side of higher cost funds at small to midsize companies, if you work for a large company they may have access to institutional pricing rates that you would not be able to access through your IRA account. Because these large companies are often investing for hundreds of employees, they can use their buying power to get the lowest cost funds available.A rollover IRA may not be right for you if you are thinking about accessing your 401(k) before age 59 ½ years old. 401(k)s allow those who have reached age 55 to access their funds penalty free. If you're a public-safety worker (police or corrections officer, firefighter, EMS responder), you can be as young as 50. In order to be eligible for these post 55, pre 59 ½ penalty free distributions, you must have either retired or separated from service after reaching age 55. You would also still have the automatic 20% federal withholding on any withdrawal from your 401(k).Another minor consideration, that differs between 401(k)s and IRAs is their legal protections when dealing with a bankruptcy. 401(k)s are protected by federal law from the vast majority of creditor judgments. IRAs also have some protections from bankruptcy, but it is capped at $1,333,272 as of November 2020, and the types of protections vary from state to state.Remember, each person’s financial circumstance is different and a rollover may or may not be the best fit for you. Either way, make sure you know the pros and cons of each option. As always, be sure to consult with a financial professional before making any major decisions.I am CEO and Chief Investment Strategist of Mainstay Capital Management, LLC, a fee-only, independent, Registered Investment Advisor with $3.0 billion under management.

[+]December is the time for year-end tax planning, which leaves many people forgetting to plan to lower their Medicare premiums. To be real, most people probably have no idea that they can even proactively plan ahead to lower their Medicare premiums. If you are still making a good income, whether through working or investments, now is a great time to determine if some proactive tax planning to lower your 2020 income will also help you decrease your premiums for Medicare. For those of you who don’t know, your Medicare premiums are based on your income. The formula for Medicare premiums contains cliffs, leading to dramatically higher premiums if you make just one extra dollar in a given tax year. Similarly, some adjustments for inflation for 2021 can further complicate planning for your Medicare premiums.Is It Worth the Effort to Lower Your Medicare Premiums?Yes, it is worth putting in the effort to lower your Medicare premiums. In some cases, reducing your income by just one dollar could slash your Medicare premiums by 40%, per year. If you are married, the surcharge will apply to both spouses regardless of their individual incomes. Who Will Get Hit with The Medicare Surcharge?You are probably wondering, what does it take to be considered a higher earner when it comes to Medicare premiums? By 2021, surcharges for Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D will kick in for singles who had more than $88,000 of income. Medicare surcharge comes into play for couples who made more than $176,000, based on their 2019 tax returns. In this case, your income is your adjusted gross income (AGI) plus tax-exempt interest from things like municipal bonds. This is often called Modified Adjust Gross Income (MAGI), which is the combining of AGI with tax-exempt interest.To be clear, paying higher Medicare premiums will not translate into better coverage or care. The Medicare surcharge simply means that recipients will have varying premiums for the same service and coverage. I still need to point out that even those at the highest income brackets will still typically pay less for Medicare than they would for private insurance. The biggest surcharges will start to kick in for singles with incomes of more than $500,000, in 2019, or married couples with incomes above $750,000.Millions of Americans are getting hit with some level of Medicare surcharges. Luckily, some will get a little help from the inflation adjustments, which will increase the income levels and corresponding Medicare premiums. People may see themselves fall into a lower surcharge category, which may translate into hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in savings. That being said, the surcharge cliff will still be an issue for many Medicare recipients.Year’s end is the best time to do a quick review of where you expect your income to fall. If you procrastinate and wait until the tax-filing season, you will not be able to make most of the money moves that could help lower your Medicare premiums in the future. Keep in mind, the tax planning that you do now is for your 2022 Medicare premiums and beyond. Keep reading to learn the one way you may be able to lower your 2021 Medicare premiums NOW.Your AGI is the income listed on Line 7 of your 1040 tax form. That number will include your capital gains and loss from investments, earnings, self-employment income, as well as tax deductions for certain retirement plan contributions. It will not include the standard deduction or other tax deductions you have taken on your Schedule A.For those at a Medicare surcharge threshold, tax-loss harvesting may become even more valuable. Look for ways to sell holdings that will generate capital losses. Also, consider delaying sales of appreciated holdings until the following year.Manage Your Required Minimum DistributionsOnce you reach 72 years or older, you will be forced to take money out of your retirement accounts. Consider making a charitable donation from your IRA. You are allowed to donate up to $100,000, per year, this way.For philanthropic donors, that can be a huge tax-savings move. You won’t get a tax deduction for your generosity, but your withdrawal won’t be taxed. More importantly, it won’t raise your AGI, which means your Medicare premiums won’t increase.Contribute to Workplace Retirement AccountsIf you are a Medicare recipient who is still employed, you have a few ways to lower your AGI and MAGI. The easiest way is to contribute to your workplace 401(k) plan. Self-employed individuals should be able to deduct their Medicare premiums. More tax deductions should result in a lower AGI overall, which could help lower future Medicare surcharges. Self-employed workers also have more options to set up workplace retirement plans. There is still time to set up a Solo 401(k) for 2020, which could help lower your AGI by $63,500. Find Tax-Free Income That Doesn’t Count for Medicare PremiumsLook for ways to maximize your tax-free income. Things like a Roth IRA, Health Savings Account (HSA) income, or payouts from Cash Value Life Insurance won’t raise your income for Medicare surcharges.Pay Medicare Premiums with Your HSAIf you have an HSA, consider using those funds to pay your Medicare premiums. Money in your HSA will come out tax-free when used to pay eligible expenses. Doing so could be enough to drop some couples to a lower Medicare surcharge level.You can potentially pay your Medicare Part A, Medicare Part B, Medicare Part C, and Medicare Part D premiums from your HSA. Unfortunately, Medigap premiums are not eligible to be paid with HSA funds.Report a Drop in Your IncomeWe are talking 2020, after all, and many of you have seen bouts of unemployment or other drops in overall income for the year. If your overall financial situation has changed, you may be able to have your Medicare surcharges for 2021 reassessed. Your income will most likely need to have decreased because of a life event such as a new marriage, divorce, death of a spouse, or even retirement. Use form SSA-44, which outlines the requirements.I’m a big fan of year-end tax planning for everyone. All the same, year-end tax planning may be even more valuable for many Medicare recipients.

Whereas once OPEC tried be a force of stability in oil markets, now the cartel and OPEC+ have put themselves in a position where instead of setting policy and leading the markets, they are reacting to the moves and sentiments of others. This is not a good sign for the power and influence of OPEC+.OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Sanusi Barkindo (L) and Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Prince ... [+]The JMMC (Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee) is the body that recommends action for OPEC and OPEC+. It met last on November 17, and did not issue a policy recommendation to the larger group. Despite the lack of any official word, analysts believe that OPEC and OPEC+ are considering a three or six month extension of the group’s current quotas. Right now, the current production quotas are designed to expire January 1 and production is set to increase by 2 million barrels per day. The reason for this change, which has been under consideration since early October, is that oil consumption has been lower than expected due to economic lockdowns and travel restrictions in Europe and the U.S. Market watchers praised it as a prudent move by the organization to keep oil prices from falling further during the winter months.However, since the JMMC meeting on November 17, the price of oil has actually risen, based largely on the promise of new vaccines for coronavirus. Now, we have word that Saudi Arabia and Russia are calling an informal meeting of JMMC representatives on Sunday, in advance of next week’s full OPEC and OPEC+ meetings. In other words, OPEC and OPEC+ are reconsider their reaction to the ever-moving market. However, oil market fundamentals indicate that demand is still sluggish in the U.S. and Europe while production remains robust.A couple sits next to a huge wooden Russian ruble coin in the center of the Siberian city of Tomsk ...

Now, the cartel seems keen to respond to every change and blip in the market, dangling the possibility of adjustments to production levels every two months. This is not a good way for OPEC or its member nations to operate.First, it isn’t helpful for member nations. Many of these oil producers are not in a position to adjust their production based on the immediate movement of the price of oil. Revenue from oil sales is how most of these states make money. They need to set their budgets and work with oil companies that extract the oil. If OPEC keeps changing their oil production quotas every few months, they won’t be able to budget effectively. Second, by becoming reactive, OPEC has made itself less powerful as a player in the market. Yes, traders will watch to see what OPEC does, but they know now that OPEC is watching them even more closely and acting based on their whims.I’m an energy historian writing about how governments and energy businesses interact globally.

Or, more telling, the S&P 500’s 3,626.22 yesterday—its highest level ever.The real news comes from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), which released the first take on corporate profits in the third quarter of 2020.Given the Q3 GDP rebound that brought that measure of the economy within about ten percentage points of where it was before the second quarter crash, one might expect corporate profits to begin coming back.They did more than that.Here is a graph showing pre-tax quarterly corporate profits, with the last point being the third quarter of 2020.And here is a second graph showing the same data but in constant 1982-1984 dollars to account for inflation.In absolute dollars, pre-tax profits in Q3 2020 were the largest ever recorded. But even in constant dollars, they only dropped to second place behind the first quarter of 2012.After the pandemic-driven economic disaster, after hundreds of billions pumped into corporations—and not counting Federal Reserve actions providing further loans and bond purchases—companies came out fine.

Here are strategies to get your books in readers hands.I have several friends and colleagues who have published books in 2020. Because of the global pandemic we are all dealing with—now on its second wave tour—that is getting more publicity than the books out there, it’s a challenge to get people to notice your book and buy it. My co-authored beauty/health book Beautiful Skin was published nearly two decades ago, so, with books now on my mind, I have been collecting this advice from other writers in hopes I can use it for my memoir and novel in progress. As an NYU Adjunct Professor and Writer’s Digest instructor, I believe in sharing knowledge, so here are steps every writer can take to get their book out there.Build Your Platform: Whatever you have been doing up till now, do more of. That includes sharing content in the genre of your book, social media posts, reaching out to media and press through LinkedIn and other ways. Another tip: see what upcoming conferences are coming up that you can speak at, even if they are virtual. Hire Additional PR Help: If you can afford it, try to hire some pr muscle to add to your publisher’s overtaxed publicity department’s efforts. You can check the Public Relations Society of America, ask through the American Society of Journalists and Authors, or the Author’s Guild, or just through word of mouth. Look for glowing reports from authors who have worked with them and make sure they have contacts in the area or genre you write about in your book. You might also want to hire someone to do social media for you who is an expert in that realm.Agent Assists: Try to build a pre-publication publicity/marketing plan at least six to nine months prior to your book getting published with your agent and publisher. Include a plan for national chain bookstores and indie bookstores. See if you can be involved in creating publicity materials as they are being developed.Cultivate a Community: Find out who else is writing similar content, whether memoir or romance or parenting or children’s books, and connect with those people through associations, organizations, or by following them on social media and sharing their content. You can also submit to anthologies. Often the writers included in the anthology will boost each other’s work. Be Inviting on Instagram: Share weekly (or even daily) memes or tips from your forthcoming book. If you are verified, like I am, link away on your Instagram stories to keep building your following . Worth a Website: Try to have a website, or at the very least an author’s page on Amazon. If you have a website, make sure it is easy for people to find and buy the book, so include all those links. Also, set up a Contact Me page with all your information readily available, and a speaking/events page. When you post, share information, news, tips, tricks, or tidbits connected to your book. Also, have them sign up for a newsletter you will send out, even if it’s retreads of your posts.PDF’s Rule: Make sure you ask your publisher to send you a pdf of the book and make sure it is watermarked (to protect your material from being scrubbed or pirated). This way you can assist the publicity department in sending out to your direct contacts for book reviews or for editors or the media. You can also use Netgalley.com to share your book with key people in the media.Blog Book Tours: A lot of influencers and bloggers do blog book tours (where they take turns promoting new books through interviews, guest posts and social media shares). If you can find out about them and add your book into the mix, that will give you a leg up and help build your community of readers. You can ask them to write reviews of your book on Amazon and Goodreads.Get Excerpted: Figure out which chapters will have the most impact and get help from your agent/publisher on making connections with editors who handle excerpts.Podcast Power: There are podcasts that are dedicated to books, such as Moms Don’t Have Time to Read Books with Zibby Owens or What Should I Read Next? Or When In Romance or Bad on Paper . If you reach out to them, they may include your book in their upcoming roster. Get Some Local Library Love: If you can, talk to your local librarian about bringing your book to the library and perhaps having you do a virtual talk for them, that can boost your publicity efforts. Bookstores Are Believers: If you have local bookstores in your area make them aware that your book is coming out. Ask them about upcoming events and if they are doing any virtual talks or readings. If not, perhaps you can put one together on a common theme with others in your genre or local authors. Offer to sign copies of your book for them to sell. Buy Your Own Book: When you get closer to publication, the publisher will offer you discounted rates for you to buy your own book. You should take advantage of that opportunity. Added bonus: once this pandemic is over, you can sell them for full price at in person events. Good luck. It’s a fraught time to be publishing, but with a sound strategy you will succeed.

The experts agree that poor health habits ultimately take a devastating toll on your body, mood and appearance. Premature wrinkles, irritated skin, muscle aches and exhaustion are just some side effects left by the following hit-and-run habits. But there are ways to arrest these health burglars and stop them in their tracks. As the co-author of Beautiful Skin, and a former beauty editor, I’ve got the prescription for you.SmokingNot only are cigarettes hazardous to your health and well-being, they are also horrible for your skin. Here’s how: Nicotine by-products cut off oxygen to blood cells, leaving skin with a sickly pallor. It also leaves you with red eyes as blood vessels dilate, giving new meaning to the term looking through rose-colored glasses. Fix It: Moisturize your skin overnight to hydrate thirsty, dry skin, and don’t be afraid to use bronzer for a color boost. Keep a gel-filled eye mask in the refrigerator and lie down for ten minutes with your eyes covered and legs propped up to improve circulation. Of course quitting smoking is the best answer. You can check out info from The American Lung Association and also get a nicotine patch to wean yourself away from your smokes.AlcoholSure it’s nice to celebrate Thanksgiving, the weekend, or just getting through the day with a bit of bubbly, but boozing it up on the regular not only damages the way your organs function, it also gives you that same pasty skin tone you get from smoking (by breaking down the collage in skin).Fix It: Consume fluids such as water, broths, and citrus juices to replenish lost moisture. Also try using a humidifier and using a moisturizing mask to increase circulation and soothe parched areas.  Cut alcohol and wine cocktails with seltzer. If you think you have a serious problem (or others are suggesting you do), try contacting Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Yo-Yo DietingIf you take turns binging and then starving yourself, you aren’t doing your body or your health any favors. A food binge followed by fasting results in low blood sugar, decreased concentration and an overall feeling of tiredness that a nap won’t correct. Fix it: Never start the day with a high sugar meal, like a candy bar or sugary cereal. After that initial burst of energy, your blood sugar levels will plummet, leaving you jittery and weak. Try keeping a journal for one week that lists everything you put eat and how you feel while eating it. It will help you notice how your cravings may be related to mood swings. Instead, don’t graze between meals, so your body will burn the food you ate. Eat high-fiber foods, which help you feel satisfied longer. Poor PostureIf while on your computer or doing a Zoom call, you feel your shoulders slumping and your back aching, monitor how stooping affects your appearance and your mood. When you have poor posture, your stomach muscles loosen and shoulders hunch forward, making you look less than confident.Fix It: To lengthen the spine and slowly stretch back muscles, try stretching out three times a day—especially when you wake up in the morning. You can also apply a heating pad or a heating rub to relax tight back muscles. One way to help is to imagine a helium-filled balloon with a string attached to your chin. Every time you slouch, imagine the string gently pulling your head higher and your spine straighter. Whether you need a quick fix or want to make a drastic lifestyle change as you pursue your side hustle or second career goals, if you keep watch on these health burglars you won’t be their victim.

Just relax. Research shows its more than just your mental health at stake.Sometimes the added pressure to get everything done by the holidays makes us feel like we can’t cope, especially when doing the side hustle dance. Whether you are working on a new venture, trying to keep an existing one afloat or have started on that second career, stress will send emotions spinning out of control. Stress happens when an anxiety-producing situation sets off your body’s fight-or-flight response. The hypothalamus, a region of the brain, triggers the release of adrenaline, cortisol and other stress hormones, which boost blood sugar, blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature.Research shows if you don’t deal with stress, your immune system can falter, making you more prone to disease. In addition, high levels of stress may increase the amount of fat you carry around your stomach. According to a decades-old study from Yale, stressed out women may suffer higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol.Here are some easy and natural ways to get rid of stress, or hold it off for a while—at least till your next deadline or delivery date.Herbal HelpValerian calms the nervous system and relaxes muscles, so work best for anxiety and insomnia. You can take it as a tea, or tincture, but before taking any herbal remedies, it’s best to consult with your doctor, since it can affect other medications. Here is more information, including a listing of published studies.San-Francisco-based psychologist, Juli Fraga suggests doing the following:Make Time for Self-Care:Working a side hustle takes extra time, which means less time for exercise, sleep (in some cases), and taking care of yourself. Make sure to find some set time each week to exercise, do an enjoyable activity, and socialize with friends.Set boundaries:Working two jobs means interacting with co-workers, bosses, and schedules. Depending on what you\'re doing, everyone might want more from you. Decide how much you can give and set boundaries. Let your manager know when and how much more you can give. If you\'re a freelancer who can set your own schedule, plan accordingly. When your other job ramps up, give yourself permission to put the brakes on accepting additional work (if this is feasible).Imagine Yourself RelaxedThe next time you feel stressed, try this guided imagery trip suggested by hypnotherapist Tara Sutphen, host of the podcast Transformations With Tara:Find a comfortable spot and close your eyes. Breathe deeply and imagine yourself at the beach. Visualize walking in the sand. Breathe deeply, lie in the sand. Feel the sun. Smell the salt air. Scoop up the sand that’s on your fingers and toes. Listen to the seagulls.Feel the sand grains run gently off your body. As you feel the sand, tell yourself that you can feel the stress melting off. See the stress leave. Breathe deeply and relax completely.This visualization releases stress; as your breath slows, your heart rate and blood pressure also ease. As you breathe deeply you oxygenate your body. That relaxes muscles and provides an emotional release.Research also shows that controlled breathing may not only relieve stress but help the immune system. Tara suggests this rapid relaxation breathing tip: inhale deeply through your nose. Hold for seven seconds. Slowly exhale through slightly open lips. Repeat until calm.The holiday season is in full swing despite the pandemic. Deadline pressure, work demands, Zoom meetings and virtual school for our kids wind us up and it’s hard to find that downtime. But according to Dr. Fraga it’s essential: “Devise a workable schedule: Try to maximize your time by setting up a schedule that allows you to have a day off or take time away for vacation, while navigating a notoriously stressful time of the year.”One final thought: In the book ""Don\'t Sweat the Small Stuff,"" by Richard Carlson there are some great stress-busting rules to live by: ""Surrender to the Fact that Life Isn\'t Fair,"" and my favorite which I try to keep in mind during challenging projects and you should, too: ""Remember, One Hundred Years from Now, All New People.""Follow me on Facebook and Instagram and Twitter.Sign up for my NYU Course Writing Parenthood (learn from 7 editors in 8 weeks and work with me to get your essays, articles published and pitches accepted.Check out my website and sign up for my newsletter.Read my other Forbes articles.See my work as editor on Narratively.I am an award-winning journalist and writing coach, and the former magazine editor-in-chief of five national consumer publications, totaling over 10 million readers.

Why It Matters'],"[""HANGZHOU, CHINA - OCTOBER 26, 2020 - Ant group logo of Hangzhou headquarters of ant group. Hangzhou, ... [+]The Ant Group is the world’s largest Fintech company, and the most innovative. They pioneered many new forms of digital finance in China, faster and bigger than anyone else. Then, unexpectedly, the authorities in Beijing decided they had to redefine Ant as … a Bank. The fallout has been huge. What drove this decision? What are the implications?View of a row of black dominoes with shadows, 2013. (Photo by Tom Kelley/Getty Images)Ant’s failed/postponed/“TBD” public offering – to have been the world’s biggest ever, and a kind of coming-out party for Chinese Finance – was derailed not (in my opinion) by Xi Jinping’s discomfiture with Jack Ma, but by the abrupt realization among Chinese financial regulators that a chain of financial dominoes was set to topple, with some quite unpleasant consequences.Here is the sequence of events that suddenly loomed up, panicking the authorities in Beijing, who pulled the emergency brake.Ant's DominoesLet’s pause the domino chain here to quantify the valuation impact. It is the key to the whole sequence. Enterprise valuation is tricky, and imprecise. A company’s “intrinsic value” is real but unobservable. There are several different methods of estimating it, including the market’s valuation, if it is a public company (“Price”), the accountant’s valuation of net assets (“Book value”), and the calculation of present and future income streams or cash flows (“Model”).  Triangulating ValueThe best perspective is gained by triangulating from two different methods – which leads to ratios like Price/Earnings, Price/Book, and Return on Assets or Return on Equity. These triangulations explicitly involve an apples-to-oranges comparisons - which is why they are tricky. For example, the market’s price has nothing to do with the accountant’s calculation of net assets, or book value. These two numbers originate from totally different sources and methodologies. Comparing them can be illuminating, but also sometimes misleading. Nevertheless, there is a lot of information packed into these simple ratios – sentiment, fundamentals, market weather, past performance and future expectations. The starting point for valuing a public company is the most concrete: market capitalization. Since this reflects the market’s consensus view of the company’s prospects, it is determined initially by the prospects of the sector to which the company belongs. But a sector — like financial services — contains companies with often very different business models. The nature of the business model, in the context of the sector, defines the category. As noted in my most recent previous column: Category clarifies what is at stake for The Ant Group. Consider the market capitalization of leading firms in three categories related to financial services: large traditional American banks, large traditional Chinese banks, and tech-centric finance companies, including payments companies and FinTech companies. (Ant is by far the largest “true Fintech” company today. But Visa V +0.1% and Mastercard MA -0.7% are at least quasi-Fintech, and represent arguably a reasonable projection of the value position Fintech companies will track as they grow.) Market Capitalization - Banks vs FintechThis begins to tell the story. But it is also puzzling, because the big banks in the U.S. and China are much larger companies in terms of substantive measures such as total assets, and personnel employed, than the tech-centric companies.  Fintech vs Banks - Total EmployeesFintech vs Banks - Total AssetsThis is where the triangulation can provide perspective. The basic Price/Earnings ratio shows a striking difference between “Fintech” and “Bank.” Fintech vs Banks P/E Ratio The difference in the Price/Book ratios — which compares the market’s estimate of the company’s value with the accountant’s tabulation – is stark. “Banks” — on average — trade at less than their book value. “Fintech” trades at more than 20 times book value. Fintechs vs Banks - Price-Book ratioFinally, the third leg of the triangle – comparing income streams, profits, etc to net assets (book value) and equity (shareholders’ invested capital), confirms the divergence in the valuation characteristics of these two categories:Fintech vs Banks - ROA and ROEThe complex and subtle character of these ratios and the differences in the underlying business models can support many quibbles – but take them all together, and the message is clear: a company categorized as a “Fintech” gets a huge valuation premium compared to one classified as a “Bank.” Ant knows this full well. They lusted after that Fintech premium. They changed the company name in June from Ant Financial Services to The Ant Group. They did everything they could to position themselves to investors as a straight Fintech play. They announced in their IPO prospectus “Ant Group is not a financial institution.” But the regulators said, in effect: No, Ant, you are a financial institution, and we’re going to regulate you like one. We’re going to impose a large capital reserve requirement. The same as for any bank. In fact, so that you really get the message, we’ll be more strict with you than we would be for an ordinary bank. Belatedly, people began to realize that this heavy-handed change would puncture the post-IPO bubble, and damage a lot of small investors in the process. So, to return to the chain of counterfactual events, which might have happened had the IPO gone forward:There was a nice illustration of contagion potential this week in the Chinese corporate bond market. The defaults of a handful of significant (but not that significant) Chinese bond issues – e.g, a coal company somewhere in the hinterlands – caused the whole market to seize up, and the withdrawal of over 20 planned corporate bond offerings. Ant’s deal was much larger, and Ant’s profile in the Chinese big picture is huge. The bursting of an Ant Group bubble would have had a much larger market impact. We’re coming to the final domino… The consequences of this sort of thing are well-known. The American sub-prime mortgage crisis preceding the 2008 crash was rooted in a very similar originate-to-distribute model, as described also in a previous column. Ant, by exporting this risk to more than 100 other Chinese financial institutions, was creating a situation where a localized one-company problem might have become a market-wide systemic one. Which brings us to the last domino…Beijing intervened — albeit at the last minute – to prevent the domino chain from toppling, and to mitigate at least the possibility of IPO chaos. Probably the right thing to have done.Whether they might have foreseen this sequence of events earlier, handled the changes in the regulations more skillfully, and eased or moderated the effective re-categorization of Ant as a Bank… are (shall we say) interesting questions.But the most pertinent of all questions now is: Where does Ant go from here?

(Photo ... [+]Value Tech Stocks such as Oracle and Intel have had a mixed year. There was good reason for this, as the deep Covid-19 recession, abundant liquidity following interest rate cuts, and the growing at-home economy drove investors to hyper-growth software as service stocks, high-risk, high reward sectors such as electric vehicles, and fast-growing platform players such as Facebook and Amazon.However, with the availability of multiple highly effective Covid-19 vaccines (Pfizer PFE +1.9%, Moderna, and AstraZeneca have published strong efficacy data on their vaccines) looking likely in 2021, things are likely to gradually start returning to normal. Moreover, the Fed could also eventually revisit its stance on ultra-low interest rates as the economy shows signs of picking up. As this plays out investors could re-visit lower growth stocks that represent compelling value. While positive news about the vaccine earlier this month has already buoyed cyclical sectors such as energy, industrials, and financials we think it’s likely that funds will flow to value tech stocks in the near-to-medium term.Our indicative theme of Value Tech Stocks includes relatively mature businesses that offer essential technology products and services and trade at reasonable valuations. Specifically, we have picked companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 18x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. Key names in the theme include Oracle , VMware Inc VMW +0.3%, Seagate Technology STX +0.2%, Cisco, and Intel.[Updated 11/10/2020] Can Intel Stock Recover?Intel stock has had a rough year, driven by delays in the company’s transition to the next generation 7-nano meter technology for its chips, some recent headwinds at its cloud and data center business, and strong competition from rival AMD in the PC and server CPU space. The stock is down by about 25% this year, significantly underperforming the NASDAQ NDAQ -0.2% which is up by over 28%. That said, there have been some positive developments that could help the company get back on track. In October, Intel announced a deal to sell its NAND business to SK Hynix for about $9 billion in a move that could allow the company to focus on its core CPU business, while bolstering its liquidity. Intel also appears to be more flexible with its manufacturing, recently noting that it could produce its next-gen chips in-house, or outsource them, or even use a hybrid model that leverages both internal and external fabs. Intel stock looks like good value at the moment, trading at just about 9.5x projected 2020 earnings. While growth could remain tepid in the near-term, Intel’s scale, its vast marketing and distribution footprint, and its large base of corporate customers, who rely on Intel processors and are likely averse to switching, should help the company in the medium to long-term.See our indicative theme on Value Tech Stocks for a complete list of technology companies – including Intel, NetApp NTAP -0.5%, and Oracle – that look like good value at the moment. The theme has underperformed this year, remaining roughly flat year-to-date, versus the S&P 500 which is up by about 10%.[Updated 9/3/2020] Value Tech StocksWhile high-growth information technology stocks have rallied sharply this year, with valuations looking increasingly stretched, we’ve picked a few stocks including Intel, Cisco, and NetApp that have relatively stable and mature businesses and still offer good value. Specifically, we have picked companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 18x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. See our analysis Value Tech Stocks for more details on the returns and performance of these stocks. Parts of the analysis are summarized below.Intel ($215 billion market cap, -15% YTD), the largest CPU vendor has been somewhat out of favor with investors on account of increasing competition from lower-cost ARM-based chipsets and the company’s delay in its rollout of its next-generation 7nm CPUs. However, Intel looks like good value considering its large base of existing customers, who rely on Intel processors and are likely averse to switch and also due to its vast marketing and distribution footprint. The stock trades at about 11x 2019 earnings.Cisco ($178 billion market cap, -10% YTD), one of the largest network equipment providers, has also underperformed the market as it has struggled with top-line and bottom-line growth. However, the increasing digitization caused by the Covid-19 pandemic could drive demand for connectivity, in turn improving sales of Cisco’s networking software, and products such as switches and routers. The stock trades at about 16x FY’19 earnings.NetApp ($10 billion market cap, -25% YTD) is a company that sells hardware and software focused on data management. While the company has seen a mixed performance this year due to weak demand from large customers and its significant reliance on hardware sales, it is looking to double down on the cloud computing market. Last month, NetApp closed a deal to acquire Spot, a leader in compute management, and cost optimization for public clouds. The stock currently trades at about 13x last fiscal year earnings.So, these value technology stocks might give stable returns from current levels.

On a total return basis, the Model Portfolio (+9.2%) outperformed the S&P 500 (+5.2%) by 4.0% over the same time. The best performing large cap stock was up 20%, and the best performing small cap stock was up 26%. Overall, 11 out of the 20 Safest Dividend Yield stocks outperformed their respective benchmarks (S&P 500 and Russell 2000) from October 21, 2020 through November 17, 2020.Only my firm’s research utilizes the superior data and earnings adjustments featured by the HBS & MIT Sloan paper, ""Core Earnings: New Data and Evidence.” This Model Portfolio leverages my firm’s Robo-Analyst technology[1], which scales forensic accounting expertise (featured in Barron’s) across thousands of stocks.[2]This Model Portfolio only includes stocks that earn an attractive or very attractive rating, have positive free cash flow and economic earnings, and offer a dividend yield greater than 3%. Companies with strong free cash flow provide higher quality and safer dividend yields because I know they have the cash to support the dividend. I think this portfolio provides a uniquely well-screened group of stocks that can help clients outperform.Featured Stock for November: Kellogg Company K +0.3%Kellogg Company (K) is the featured stock in November’s Safest Dividend Yields Model Portfolio.While revenue has been stagnant, Kellogg has grown core earnings[3] by 5% compounded annually since 2015. Kellogg’s core earnings margin increased from 8% in 2015 to 10% TTM.Kellogg’s return on invested capital (ROIC) of 9% is unchanged from 2015, but the firm’s economic earnings, or the true cash flows of the business, have grown from $811 million in 2015 to $954 million TTM.Figure 1: Core Earnings Since 2014K Core Earnings Since 2014Cash Flow Supports Dividend PaymentsKellogg has paid a dividend every year since 1952. The firm increased its dividend payments from $1.98/share in 2015 to $2.26/share in 2019, or 3% compounded annually. The current quarterly dividend, when annualized provides a 3.5% dividend yield.Kellogg’s dividend payment is supported by the firm’s strong free cash flow (FCF). Kellogg generated $5.5 billion (25% of current market cap) in FCF while paying $3.7 billion in dividends from 2015 to 2019, per Figure 2. Over the TTM, Kellogg has generated $1.1 billion in FCF and paid out $781 million in dividends.Figure 2: Kellogg’s FCF vs. Dividends Since 2015K FCF vs. Dividends PaidCompanies with strong FCF provide higher quality dividend yields because I know the firm has the cash to support its dividend. On the other hand, dividends from companies with low or negative FCF cannot be trusted as much because the company may not be able to sustain paying dividends.K Is UndervaluedAt its current price of $64/share, K has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 0.6. This ratio means the market expects Kellogg’s NOPAT to permanently decline by 40%. This expectation seems overly pessimistic given that Kellogg has grown NOPAT by 4% compounded annually over the past two decades.Even if Kellogg’s margin falls to 9% (ten-year low) and the firm grows revenue by 1% compounded annually over the next decade, which results in NOPAT falling by less than 1% compounded annually over the same time, the stock is worth $105/share today – a 64% upside.

[+]We believe Philip Morris stock (NYSE: PM) is a decent opportunity at the present time. PM trades at $77 currently and is, in fact, down 10% so far this year. It traded at a pre-Covid high of $88 in February and is 13% below that level now. PM stock has gained 28% from the low of $60 seen in March 2020, less than the S&P 500 which is up 60% from its March bottom. PM’s stock has underperformed the market as the drop in the stock price during the coronavirus crisis was much less than the broader market’s drop in the first place, due to the company belonging to a largely defensive tobacco sector. Thus, the stock recovery has been lower than the market. However, we believe that the gradual lifting of lockdowns over recent months is leading to an improvement in supply networks and consumer demand. Rising demand for IQOS (smokeless tobacco brand), higher cigarette prices, and a normalized supply network is expected to result in healthy revenue and margin growth in 2021. This will likely drive the stock up 10% from its current level. Our conclusion is based on our detailed comparative analysis on Philip Morris stock performance during the current crisis with that during the 2008 recession in our interactive dashboard.2020 Coronavirus CrisisTimeline for 2020 Crisis So Far:In contrast, here is how PM stock and the broader market performed during the 2007-08 crisis.Timeline for 2007-08 CrisisPM vs S&P500 Performance Over 2007-08 Financial CrisisPM stock declined from levels of close to $55 in September 2008 to levels of little over $33 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out), implying PM stock lost close to 40% from its approximate pre-crisis peak. It recovered post the 2008 crisis, to levels of over $48 in early 2010, rising by 44% between March 2009 and January 2010. In comparison, the S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51% and recovered 48%.PM Fundamentals Over Recent YearsPhilip Morris revenues increased from $26.7 billion in 2016 to $29.8 billion in 2019 due to higher shipments of IQOS and increase in cigarette prices. Along with higher revenues, margins also increased which was reflected in the EPS which went up from $4.48 to $4.61 during this period. However, revenues saw a y-o-y decline of 4% in the first nine months of 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic. During the same period, earnings improved as the company spent less on marketing.Does PM Have Sufficient Cash Cushion To Meet Its Obligations Through The Coronavirus Crisis?PM’s total debt increased from $26.5 billion in 2016 to $29.5 billion at the end of Q3 2020, while its total cash increased from $4.2 billion to $4.8 billion over the same period. At the same time, the company’s cash from operations which was $8.1 billion in 2016, stood at $6.7 billion in the first nine months of 2020. Though debt has increased, the company’s increased cash balance and improving CFO generation capacity over the years is likely to help PM weather the current crisis.ConclusionPhases of Covid-19 Crisis:Despite the recent surge in the number of new Covid-19 cases in the U.S., we expect continued improvement in demand to buoy market expectations. As investors focus their attention on expected 2021 results, we believe Philip Morris International Inc stock has the potential for modest gains of close to 10% once fears surrounding the Covid outbreak are put to rest. As per Philip Morris valuation, Trefis has a price estimate of $85 per share for PM’s stock.TREFISWhat if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead?

[+]Despite an impressive rise of 80% from its March lows of this year, at the current price of $65 per share, Rio Tinto stock (NYSE: RIO) still has some upside left. RIO stock rallied from $36 to $65 off its recent bottom, compared to the S&P 500 which increased 60% from its recent lows. The stock has been able to beat the broader market in the last 8 months on the back of recovery in iron ore prices with the US government announcing a string of measures along with stimulus packages announced in other economies to keep businesses afloat. In addition, with the lockdowns being lifted gradually, we are set to see further rise in iron ore demand and reduction of supply constraints. This will drive faster growth in revenues and margins, thus providing a potential further upside of more than 10% from its current level. Our dashboard What Factors Drove 24% Change In Rio Tinto Stock Between 2017 And Now? provides the key numbers behind our thinking.The rise in stock price between 2017-2019 is justified by the 7.9% increase in Rio Tinto’s revenues. Revenues went up from $40.5 billion in 2017 to $43.7 billion in 2019, mainly due to a rise in iron ore prices and higher shipments. Revenue growth was partially offset by 5% decline in the P/S (price-to-sales) multiple, which went down from 2.35x in 2017 to 2.23x in 2019. This was because the company’s profitability declined between 2017-19 on the back of a higher base and significant impairment charges. RIO’s P/S multiple crashed further in the beginning of 2020 following the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. However, it has recovered over recent months in tandem with a sharp recovery in iron ore prices, and the multiple currently stands close to 2.5x (higher than the Dec 2019 level). We believe the multiple will remain elevated around the current level, while higher revenues will drive the stock further.Upside Trigger?The outbreak and global spread of coronavirus led to lockdown in various cities across the globe, which affected industrial and economic activity. Lower demand from construction players and shedding of capacity by major steel companies, mainly in China, has led to a drop in global iron ore prices. Additionally, the lockdown has affected the global supply chain for companies like Rio Tinto which have operations spread across geographies, leading to a decline in production and shipments. This was evident from the recently released H1 2020 results, where Rio Tinto’s revenues declined by 7% to $19.4 billion while net earnings were down by 20%. Though iron ore production was up, it could not translate into higher revenues due to a drop in price realization.The actual recovery and its timing hinge on the broader containment of the coronavirus spread. Our dashboard Trends In U.S. Covid-19 Cases provides an overview of how the pandemic has been spreading in the U.S. and contrasts with trends in Brazil and Russia. As the global lock downs are lifted gradually, iron ore demand is expected to rise with supply constraints easing. This is likely to lead to an uptick in shipments toward the end of 2020. Global iron ore price has also increased since April, from $80/ton to over $123/ton currently. Though the stock has increased significantly over the last 8 months, the recent surge in Covid positive cases in the US and Europe could prove to be an impediment for RIO. If the rise in cases warrant a re-imposition of lockdowns, then the stock could see a sharp drop. However, in the absence of another lockdown, revenue and earnings will see sharp growth in 2021. This will likely lead to further uptick in the stock, where RIO’s investors have an opportunity see more than 10% growth in wealth.TREFISWhat if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead?

[+]After a 65% rise since the March 23 lows of this year, at the current price of around $370 per share we believe Teleflex stock (NYSE: TFX), best known for its single-use medical devices for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, has reached its near-term potential. TFX stock has rallied from $225 to $370 off the recent bottom compared to the S&P which moved 59% over the same period, with the resumption of economic activities as lockdowns are gradually lifted. TFX stock is also up 49% from levels of $250 seen in early 2018, two years ago.Some of the 49% rise of the last 2 years is justified by the roughly 21% growth seen in Teleflex’s TFX -0.7% revenues from 2017 to 2019. Also, the company saw a 3% growth in total shares outstanding, resulting in a 18% growth in revenue per share to $56.18 in 2019, compared to $47.69 in 2017. With the growth in RPS, the company’s P/S (price-to-sales) ratio also expanded. We believe the stock is likely to see downside after the recent uptick and the potential weakness from a recession-driven by the Covid outbreak. Our dashboard, ‘What Factors Drove 49% Change in Teleflex Stock between 2017 and now?, has the underlying numbers.Teleflex’s P/S multiple changed from 5.2x in 2017 to 6.7x in 2019. While the company’s P/S is 6.6x now, there is a potential downside risk when the current P/S is compared to levels seen in the past years, P/S of around 5x at the end of 2017 and 2018.So what’s the likely trigger and timing for downside?The global spread of Coronavirus has meant lower demand for Teleflex’s products primarily for interventional and surgical uses, given these products are utilized for elective procedures, which have seen a significant decline in 2020 owing to the pandemic. That said, the company reported better than expected Q3, led by higher demand for respiratory and vascular products in the current pandemic. Total revenue was down 3.1% y-o-y to $628 million, while the adjusted earnings of $2.77 per share reflect a 6.7% decline over the $2.97 figure reported in the prior year quarter. Total revenue also benefited from the company’s last year acquisition of IWG High Performance Conductors. The mismatch between revenue and earnings decline can be attributed to a 140 bps decline in gross margins during the quarter. This margins were impacted due to lower sales and higher manufacturing costs. Looking forward, with economies opening up gradually and growth in number of elective procedures performed, the demand for Teleflex’s products is expected to rise. The company’s recently announced acquisition of Z-Medica, a company specializing in bleeding control solutions, is also expected to bolster the margin growth over the coming years. That said, much of these factors appear to be priced in the current stock value of $370, despite the expected recovery in demand post Covid. In reality, 2020 full year revenues are estimated to be down 3% to $2.5 billion while earnings are expected to be down 6% to $10.50.The actual recovery and its timing hinge on the broader containment of the coronavirus spread. Our dashboard Trends In U.S. Covid-19 Cases provides an overview of how the pandemic has been spreading in the U.S. and contrasts with trends in Brazil and Russia. Following the Fed stimulus — which set a floor on fear — the market has been willing to “look through” the current weak period and take a longer-term view. With investors focusing their attention on 2021 results, the valuations become important in finding value. Though market sentiment can be fickle, and evidence of an uptick in new cases could spook investors once again. At levels of around $370, TFX stock is trading at 6.9x its 2020 expected RPS of $53.95, and 6.0x its 2021 expected RPS of $61.25. This compares with P/S of 5.2x seen in 2017 and 4.8x seen in late 2018, making the stock appear vulnerable to downside risk.TREFISWhat if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead?

[1] The system will add laser-based lidar technology along with other significant software and hardware enhancements. While Xpeng and other Chinese automotive companies already offer autonomous highway driving on their vehicles, the lidar-based solution is expected to improve accuracy, helping Xpeng cars to drive themselves in more densely populated urban areas as well. Notably, Xpeng will be the first company to use lidar sensors in mass-market vehicles. Google GOOG +1.2% uses the technology in its Waymo self-driving cars, although they remain in the test phase.While the 34% jump in the stock price appears overdone, given that we don’t yet know the effectiveness of the system or the incremental costs that the new sensors will add, investors have reason to be optimistic. Autonomous driving is seen as one of the hottest themes in the automotive space. Moreover, self-driving algorithms are based on machine learning, and the more miles people drive using autonomous cars the smarter the algorithms become. If Xpeng’s system works well, it could enable the company to build an early mover advantage in the space, enabling it to gather more data and improve its self-driving capabilities.[11/3/2020] Strong October Deliveries Drive Chinese EV StocksThe stock prices of major U.S. listed Chinese electric-vehicle manufacturers soared on Monday, as they reported strong deliveries for October. Nio - one of the largest EV startups in China - saw its stock soar by about 9%, as it reported that deliveries in October almost doubled year-over-year to 5,055 vehicles. Xpeng (NYSE: XPEV), another premium EV player saw its stock rise by about 7%, as it delivered about 3,040 vehicles through the month, marking an increase of about 230% from a year ago, driven primarily by sales of its P7 sedan which was launched earlier this year. However, deliveries were slightly lower month-over-month. Li Auto (NASDAQ NDAQ -0.2%: LI), a company that sells EVs that also have a small gasoline engine - said that it delivered 3,692 of its Li ONE SUVs in October, marking a month-over-month increase of about 5%.

Parts of the analysis are summarized below.Overview Of Nio, Li Auto & Xpeng’s BusinessNio, which was founded in 2014, currently offers three premium electric SUVs, ES8, ES6, and EC6, which are priced starting at about $50k. The company is working on developing self-driving technology and also offers other unique innovations such as Battery as a Service (BaaS) - which allows customers to subscribe for car batteries, rather than paying for them upfront. While the company has scaled up production, it hasn’t come without challenges, as it recalled about 5,000 vehicles last year after reports of multiple fires.Li Auto sells Extended-Range Electric Vehicles, which are essentially EVs that also have a small gasoline engine that can generate additional electric power for the battery. This reduces the need for EV-charging infrastructure, which is currently limited in China. The company’s hybrid strategy appears to be paying off - with its Li ONE SUV, which is priced at about $46,000 - ranking as the top-selling SUV in the new energy vehicle segment in China in September 2020. The new energy segment includes fuel cell, electric, and plug-in hybrid vehicles.Xpeng produces and sells premium electric vehicles including the G3 SUV and the P7 four-door sedan, which are roughly positioned as rivals to Tesla’s Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan, although they are more affordable, with the basic version of the G3 starting at about $22,000 post subsidies. The G3 SUV was among the top 3 Electric SUVs in terms of sales in China in 2019. While the company began production in late 2018, initially via a deal with an established automaker, it has started production at its own factory in the Guangdong province.How Have The Deliveries, Revenues & Margins TrendedNio delivered about 21k vehicles in 2019, up from about 11k vehicles in 2018. This compares to Xpeng which delivered about 13k vehicles in 2019 and Li Auto which delivered about 1k vehicles, considering that it began production only late last year. While Nio’s deliveries this year could approach about 40k units, Li Auto and Xpeng are likely to deliver around 25k vehicles with Li Auto seeing the highest growth. Over 2019, Nio’s Revenues stood at $1.1 billion, compared to about $40 million for Li Auto and $330 million for Xpeng. Nio’s Revenues are likely to grow 95% this year, while Xpeng’s Revenues are likely to grow by about 120%. All three companies remain deeply lossmaking as costs related to R&D and SG&A remain high relative to Revenues. Nio’s Net Margins stood at -195% in 2019, Li Auto’s margins stood at about -860% while Xpeng’s margins stood at -160%. However, margins are likely to improve sharply in 2020, as volumes pick up.ValuationNio’s Market Cap stood at about $37 billion as of October 28, 2020, with its stock price rising by about 7x year-to-date due to surging investor interest in EV stocks. Li Auto and Xpeng, which were both listed in the U.S. around August as they looked to capitalize on surging valuations, have a market cap of about $15 billion and $14 billion, respectively. On a relative basis, Nio trades at about 15x projected 2020 Revenues, Li Auto trades at about 12x, while Xpeng trades at about 20x.While valuations are certainly high, investors are likely betting that these companies will continue to grow in the domestic market, while eventually playing a larger role in the global EV space leveraging China’s relatively low-cost manufacturing, and the country’s ecosystem of battery and auto parts suppliers. Of the three companies, Nio might be the safer bet, considering its slightly longer track record, higher Revenues, and investments in technology such as battery swaps and self-driving. Li Auto also looks attractive considering its rapid growth - driven by the uptake of its hybrid powertrains - and relatively attractive valuation of about 12x 2020 RevenueTREFISWhat if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead?

[+]Zoom stock (NASDAQ: ZM) is up 6x this year, as the company’s video conferencing software became an indispensable tool for people working and learning from home through Covid-19 and the associated lockdowns. Zoom now has a market cap of over $120 billion and is now valued more richly than technology and consulting behemoth IBM (NYSE: IBM) and aerospace leader Boeing. Is Zoom’s valuation justified? We don’t think it is. The stock now trades at about 170x consensus 2021 EPS and about 50x Revenues. Sure, Zoom has been posting breakneck growth through the pandemic - Revenues were up over 4x year-over-year over the most recent quarter - but it’s not clear that Zoom will be able to sustain its pace.The physical economy is likely to open up further through 2021, with many developed countries likely to have access to a highly effective Covid-19 vaccine starting from the spring. This could put the brakes on Zoom’s growth. For perspective, per consensus estimates, Zoom’s Revenue is likely to slow to just about 30% over the next fiscal year, compared to levels of close to 300% this fiscal. While 30% growth is more than respectable, at these valuations, we’d expect better. Okta - a SaaS player that offers identity and access management software- is projected to grow at over 30% next year, with the stock trading at about 35x projected Revenues. DocuSign - a company that offers e-signature solutions - trades at about 29x projected Revenue, with growth likely to come in at over 30% next year.Competition is also mounting for Zoom. Platform titans such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) - which is deeply entrenched in the enterprise space and Google’s GOOG +1.2% parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) could continue to refine their video conferencing services, and offer better integration with their other products reducing Zoom’s growth potential.See our theme on Work and learn from home stocks for more details on the relative stock price and fundamental performance of major work and learn from home stocks.[Updated 11/12/2020] What The Vaccine Really Means For WFH StocksWork and learn from home stocks have had a solid run this year, as Covid-19 drives demand for connectivity, collaboration, and cybersecurity-related software. For perspective, our indicative theme of Work And Learn From Home Stocks is up by over 190% year-to-date on an equally weighted basis. However, a Coronavirus vaccine is looking like a real possibility in the coming quarters, following the surprisingly strong efficacy data for Pfizer’s PFE +1.9% vaccine candidate which was released earlier this week. So what does this mean for work from home stocks? While we believe that demand will hold up for these companies in the long-run, investors could re-think valuations in the near-term and more volatility is to be expected. For example, Zoom – one of the biggest beneficiaries of the WFH trend – has dropped 17% since the vaccine news, while DocuSign DOCU +1.2% is down by about 10%.Although it’s likely that a vaccine will become available to the general public by early next year, it could take at least a year or two years for the global population to get vaccinated considering manufacturing and distribution challenges. Moreover, the trend of working from home appears to be here to stay even post the pandemic, as companies look to cut costs, access a larger base of talent, and give employees more flexibility. This should ensure that demand holds up in the long-term. Twitter, for example, has indicated that its employees can permanently work from home, while Facebook expects about half of its workforce to work remotely within the next decade. Additionally, most of these remote collaboration and communication players have business models that are subscription-based, with some level of switching costs involved providing them with some demand visibility.[Updated 11/2/2020] With Covid Cases Surging, Should You Revisit Work From Home Stocks?The Covid-19 pandemic has forced people to increasingly work and learn from home, causing surging demand for connectivity, collaboration, and cybersecurity-related software. Our indicative theme on Work And Learn From Home Stocks is up by almost 200% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 which is up a mere 1.5%. Although the theme was impacted by the big sell-off in the market over the last week, declining by about -8%, it’s likely to recover quickly considering that Covid-19 cases have been surging in the U.S. in recent weeks, potentially calling for greater restrictions and stay-home orders. Zoom (NASDAQ: ZM) has been the biggest driver of the theme’s returns, rising by almost 580% year-to-date. On the other side, Slack’s (NYSE: WORK) performance has been more muted, rising 14% this year. Below is a bit more about the companies in our theme.Zoom has emerged as the video conferencing platform of choice through the pandemic, thanks to its easy user interface and simple sign-up process.

While the stock has rallied 173% year-to-date, it declined -8% over the last 5 trading days.CrowdStrike CRWD +0.6% is a cybersecurity player that offers a cloud-delivered endpoint protection platform, which relies on lightweight software running on the customer’s servers or laptops.

The stock has gained about 82% this year and is down by about -4% over the last 5 trading days.Slack Technologies is best known for its collaboration platform that is positioned as an alternative to email. However, the stock has seen pressure in recent months, as Microsoft’s MSFT +0.6% rival product Teams has been gaining ground, thanks to its massive customer base.

[+]Coty’s stock (NYSE: COTY) jumped a massive 48% in the last 5 trading days. Despite this, the stock is still down 30% from year-beginning levels. So what should you do next? We need to be cautious when considering such big moves as a pullback can happen. We assess that despite Coty’s recent climb, it could still be a risky investment. We have maintained this stance for the last couple of months, while acknowledging that investors can benefit from near term movement. That near term movement happened last week, and exceeded our expectations. What comes next could be a relative quiet period with little to no returns, and possibly, a fall. This assessment is primarily based on the output of our AI engine which analyzes past patterns in stock movements to predict near term behavior. It suggests nearly a -6% pull back for Coty over the next 1 month, and only a small return of 1.2% over the next 3 months. Our detailed dashboard highlights the expected return for Coty given its recent move, and can help you understand near-term return probabilities for different levels of movements.When considering a longer time frame, it is important to look at the behavior of the underlying fundamentals. Our dashboard Big Movers: Coty Moved 48% - What Next? lays this out, and the trend is not encouraging.Coty’s revenue has decreased -17% from $7,650 Mil in 2017 to $6,288 Mil in 2019, and this decline has been consistent. For the last 12 months, this figure stood at $3,899 Mil, implying a further decrease of -38% over 2019 numbers. In addition, the company has consistently struggled with profitability. Coty’s net margins have decreased from -5.5% in 2017 to -60.2% in 2019. For the last 12 months, this figure stood at -21.5%. It has not turned a profit in the last 3 years. Considering the above, we remain cautious about Coty as a prospective long-term investment unless there is a sharp rebound in demand accompanied by improved margin control.TREFISBut what if you are looking for a diversified portfolio?

[+]We believe that Hill-Rom Holdings stock (NYSE: HRC), best known for its hospital beds and patient mobility solutions, may be a good buying opportunity at the present time. HRC stock trades near $97 currently and it is, in fact, down 15% so far this year (from $114 at the beginning of 2020). It traded at $109 in February 2020 – just before the coronavirus pandemic hit the world – and it is currently 11% below that level, as well. HRC stock has rallied over 29% since its March lows of $75, underperforming the S&P 500 which gained about 61%. This can be attributed to a sharp decline of 15% in a single trading session after its Q3 earnings announcement in late July. While the earnings were ahead of street estimates, the company’s forecast for the full year EPS was below the analysts consensus, driving the stock price lower. Since then, the stock has remained rangebound even after a Q4 beat. After the correction seen over the recent months, we believe HRC stock can see upside of over 15% from the current levels. Our conclusion is based on our comparative analysis of Hill-Rom stock performance during the current financial crisis with that during the 2008 recession in our interactive dashboard.2020 Coronavirus CrisisTimeline of 2020 Crisis So Far:In contrast, here is how HRC stock and the broader market fared during the 2007-08 crisisTimeline of 2007-08 CrisisHill-Rom and S&P 500 Performance Over 2007-08 Financial CrisisHRC stock declined from levels of about $29 in September 2007 (pre-crisis peak) to levels of $10 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out), implying HRC stock lost 67%. It recovered post the 2008 crisis, rallying a strong 144% to levels of $24 by January 2010. In comparison, the S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51% from its peak in September 2007 to its bottom in March 2009, followed by a sharp recovery of 48% by January 2010.Hill-Rom Fundamentals Over Recent Years Have Been RobustHill-Rom revenues increased from $2.7 billion in fiscal 2015 to $2.9 billion in fiscal 2020 (fiscal ends in September), led by an increased demand for hospital beds. Hill-Rom also managed to expand its Net Margins from 2.4% to 7.7% over the same period. This resulted in EPS expansion from $0.83 to $3.35. More recently, the company’s Q4 revenues saw a 10% y-o-y decline due to the impact of the pandemic on the company’s business. The company reported earnings of $0.64 on a per share basis, compared to $0.42 in the prior year quarter, benefiting primarily from lower taxes in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter.Does Hill-Rom Company Have Sufficient Cash Cushion To Meet Its Obligations Through The Coronavirus Crisis?Hill-Rom’s total debt decreased from $2.3 billion in 2016 to $1.9 billion at the end of fiscal 2020, while its total cash grew from $232 million to $296 million over the same period. Hill-Rom generated $482 million in cash from operations in fiscal 2020. Overall, the company has enough liquidity cushion to weather the current crisis.ConclusionPhases of Covid-19 Crisis:As the global economy opens up and lockdowns are lifted in phases, consumer demand is expected to pick up.

[+]HSBC stock (NYSE: HSBC) has 35% upside (to pre-crisis level) in 1-2 years as the lower interest rate environment improves and GDP sees some recovery, leading to a growth in total loans and net interest income. HSBC stock currently trades near $27 and it has lost around 32% in value so far this year. It traded at a pre-Covid high of $36 in February, and it is 26% below that level now. Also, the stock has further lost around 5% since its March market lows of $28 after the multi-billion dollar stimulus package announced by the U.S. government, which has helped the stock market recover to a large extent. The stock is lagging the broader markets by a huge margin (S&P 500 is up about 60%), as investors are cautious about the impact of lower interest rates and higher provision for loan losses on its profitability – profit after tax is down 46% y-o-y in Q3 and 62% cumulatively for the first three quarters.HSBC is heavily dependent on its core banking business which generated around 71% of its revenues in 2019 – the bank is very sensitive to changes in interest rates which impacts its net interest spread. Further, uncertain economic conditions affects the loan repayment capability of customers, increasing the probability of loan defaults. The bank increased its provision for credit losses in order to compensate for that risk – up from $8.7 billion at 31st December 2019 to $13.7 billion by Q3 2020. However, we expect the situation to improve in the coming months driven by recovery in demand and gradual improvement in economic conditions. Moreover, decline in the provision for credit losses can improve HSBC’s profitability in the near term-providing a boost to the bank’s stock price. In view of the movement in HSBC stock since late March, we believe that the stock has room for growth in the near future provided there is no sudden uptick in the Covid-19 cases leading to further lockdown restrictions. Our conclusion is based on our detailed analysis of HSBC’s stock performance during the current crisis with that during the 2008 recession in an interactive dashboard analysis.2020 Coronavirus CrisisTimeline of 2020 Crisis So Far:In contrast, here’s how HSBC and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis2007-08 Financial CrisisTimeline of 2007-08 CrisisHSBC vs S&P 500 Performance Over 2007-08 Financial CrisisHSBC stock declined from levels of around $49 in September 2007 (pre-crisis peak) to levels of around $20 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out), implying HSBC stock lost 60% from its approximate pre-crisis peak. It recovered post the 2008 crisis, to levels of about $34 in early 2010, rising by 71% between March 2009 and January 2010. In comparison, the S&P 500 declined by 51% before recovering by 48% between March 2009 and January 2010.HSBC FundamentalsHSBC’s revenues have decreased from around $60 billion in 2015 to $56 billion in 2019, primarily due to the low-interest environment and sub-par performance of its global banking markets. Moreover, HSBC’s earnings per share fell from $3.24 per share in 2015 to $1.48 in 2019. HSBC’s Q3 2020 net revenues were 11% below the level seen a year ago, while the EPS figure for the quarter fell from $0.15 in Q3 2019 to $0.07 in Q3 2020.ConclusionPhases of Covid-19 crisis:Keeping in mind the trajectory over 2009-10, this suggests a potential recovery to around $36 (35% upside) once economic conditions begin to show signs of improving.

[+]Why is the market letting you buy $50 of PepsiCo’s revenues for a price of roughly $144 per share of PepsiCo stock (NASDAQ: PEP) – implying a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of close to 3x – while for its close rival Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), you need to shell out almost double, 6x? Coca-Cola’s 6x multiple is based on its $37.3 billion in 2019 sales ($8.80 in sales on a per-share basis) and a stock price of $53. The contrast is not any better if you use the sales figure from the last four quarters instead of the last fiscal – using numbers of the last four quarters, PepsiCo’s P/S multiple is marginally lower than 3x, compared to Coca-Cola’s 6.8x. More importantly, the mismatch isn’t due to any drop in PepsiCo’s stock price, as its P/S multiple would still be 3x (as opposed to 7x for Coca-Cola) even if its shares were trading at the all time high of $147 seen a couple of months back.Here’s what’s going on. The price-to-sales, or P/S, multiple for a company is higher when the sales growth is higher, and it has a demonstrated ability to translate those sales to profits, with an expectation to do so consistently.Sure, PEP’s revenue growth is much higher (2.3% average annual revenue growth over the last 3 years vs about -3.4% for KO). However, PEP’s returns are low. Over the last 4 quarters, PEP’s net income margin (net profits as a percent of revenue) stood at 10%, significantly lower than KO’s 25% margins. Using another measure of return, PEP’s 15% free cash flow margin (net profits adjusted for non-cash expenses as a percentage of revenue), is also lower compared to 23% for KO. Understandably, the market sees more risk in PEP’s ability to translate its revenues to profits and cash flow, compared to KO’s track record.Our dashboard PepsiCo vs. The Coca-Cola Company: Is PEP Stock Appropriately Valued Given Its significantly lower P/S Multiple Compared to KO? details the fuller picture based on Revenue Growth, Returns (ability to generate profits from growth), and Risk (sustainability of profits), parts of which are summarized below.1. Revenue Growth2. Returns (Profits)However, PEP’s metrics should improve as it will reap the benefits of recent acquisitions over the next few quarters. Also, as Coca-Cola’s y-o-y gains from refranchising diminish, the gap between the margins of these two companies will narrow.3. Risk The net of it allIn summary, though PEP’s sales growth is higher, KO’s higher price-to-sales multiple compared to PEP may be a reflection of KO’s better track record of translating its sales to profits. However, we believe that this benefit was due to the refranchising efforts over recent years and might not continue to last for long. PepsiCo will eventually narrow its profitability gap with Coca-Cola. In fact, much more successful deleveraging over recent years and a strong liquidity position, along with better product diversification, is likely to lead to better valuation for PepsiCo over the coming quarters, which is expected to be reflected in a higher P/S multiple compared to its current levels.

Carriers are also heavily promoting 5G devices, with the new iPhones effectively available for free for subscribers with trade-ins and some other commitments. As 5G adoption grows, it should have a positive impact on demand across a wide range of companies, ranging from semiconductor players, tower infrastructure companies, testing equipment manufacturers, and wireless carriers.

On the other side, Verizon VZ +0.3% stock is down by about 2% year-to-date.[Updated 10/7/2020] Verizon, Qualcomm, Qorvo: Stocks To Watch As Apple Preps 5G iPhonesOur indicative theme of 5G stocks – which includes semiconductor players, tower infrastructure companies, testing equipment providers, and wireless carriers that stand to gain from the next-generation networks – is up by about 19% year-to-date, versus 5.5% for the S&P 500 as of 10/7/2020. While 5G wireless networks are being rolled out in the U.S. and other developed markets, mainstream adoption of the technology is likely to gather pace as Apple – one of the largest and most iconic smartphone vendors – is set to unveil its first set of 5G handsets next week. Below, we provide a bit more about some of the companies in our theme, how the 5G upgrade cycle could benefit them, and how they have fared thus far in 2020.Qualcomm, one of the largest modem and mobile processor vendors, is seen as a leader in 5G wireless technology. The company could see sales pick up as smartphone behemoth Apple is widely expected to use Qualcomm’s modems in its new iPhones. The stock is up 38% year-to-date.Skyworks Solutions sells analog semiconductors that include power amplifiers, front-end modules, and radio frequency products that go into mobile and wireless devices as well as wireless infrastructure equipment. The company counts Apple as one of its biggest customers. The stock is up 23% this year.Qorvo, Inc. QRVO +1.3%also supplies RF components to smartphone players such as Apple, as well as to the infrastructure, and defense space. The stock is up 13% this year. (See our analysis Is Skyworks A Better Bet Than Qorvo?)American Tower Corp AMT +0.5%, the largest U.S.-based tower leasing company, is structured as a real estate investment trust. Tower companies stand to gain from 5G considering that antennas and other equipment for 5G are heavier and larger, meaning that rentals could also be higher. The stock is up about 6% year-to-date.Verizon , one of the largest U.S. wireless carriers, stands to benefit from 5G related subscriber additions and potentially improved pricing for 5G plans. The stock has remained roughly flat year-to-date.Keysight Technologiesprovides electronics test and measurement equipment and software targeted at the wireless sector. Keysight should benefit as the 5G rollout gathers speed globally, as equipment and chip manufacturers who want to design and develop 5G products likely require its testing and measuring solutions. The stock is down 3% year-to-date.TREFISAre you looking to invest in a balanced portfolio of stocks?

[+]Solar stocks have done exceedingly well this year. Our indicative theme of Solar Stocks is up by 244% year-to-date, compared to the broader S&P 500 which is up by about 11% over the same period. There’s a good reason for this. President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to spend about $2 trillion on combating climate change, with a goal of making electricity generation carbon neutral by the year 2035. The adoption of solar is likely to be key to meeting these goals. Ultra-low interest rates also mean that it’s quite cheap to fund solar projects. However, are investors discounting the risks? The stocks in our theme now trade at very high valuation multiples. First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR) trades at about 61x adjusted 2019 earnings, SolarEdge trades at about 60x, while Enphase Energy trades at over 140x and demand will need to jump significantly to justify these valuations. Secondly, while costs have declined significantly, the industry is still somewhat dependent on favorable legislation to drive demand. It might not be smooth sailing on this front just yet - while Democrats have won the White House, their majority in the House of Representatives has declined, and the Senate won’t be decided until run-off elections in January.[Updated 9/3/2020] Enphase, SolarEdge, First Solar: Solar Stocks Poised To ShineSolar stocks are back in favor with investors, with our indicative theme of U.S. listed solar stocks - which includes First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR), Enphase Energy and NextEra among others up by about 71% YTD versus about 6% for the broader S&P 500. The theme has also outperformed, returning over 653% since the end of 2017, compared to about 30% in the S&P. While Enphase was the biggest driver of year-to-date returns, rising 159%, NextEra Energy saw the lowest gains, rising by about 17%.See our theme of U.S. listed Solar Stocks for data on historical performance and returns of the largest and most relevant names in the U.S. solar industry.There are multiple trends driving investor interest in solar stocks. Firstly, solar is becoming increasingly viable, with the cost of power comparing favorably with natural gas and other renewable sources. Demand in the U.S. has also been strong, driven by the residential and commercial space as well as strong regulatory support, particularly from State governments. In fact, solar became the largest source of new electricity generation capacity last year accounting for about 40% of total capacity additions. [1] Historically low interest rates could also help the industry, reducing project financing costs, leading to further demand for solar. Moreover, the broader renewable energy space could outperform if Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden - who is ahead in the polls - is elected this November. Mr. Biden has pledged to spend almost $2 trillion on combating climate change, with a goal of making electricity generation carbon neutral by the year 2035.First Solar manufactures solar panels that are used primarily in utility-scale solar farms. Although the company’s revenues have remained almost flat over the last two years due to lower module prices, its strong balance sheet and its differentiated thin-film panel technology could help it grow as the market continues to expand. The stock is up by about 30% year-to-date.Enphase Energy - primarily produces components such as power inverters and control systems for solar installations. These inverters convert the direct current produced by solar panels into the alternating current used by the grid and typically control the solar power system. The stock has significantly outperformed, rising 159% year-to-date.ENPHNextEra Energy - the largest U.S. utility by market cap, is also the single largest owner of solar generation capacity outside China. The company is also betting big on battery storage, with plans to build nearly 700 megawatts of storage projects in California before the end of 2022. The stock is up about 17% this year.SolarEdge Technologies provides power optimizers, solar inverters, and monitoring systems for solar power systems. While the solar panel business is relatively commoditized, the components that SolarEdge provides are more specialized and help to control and gather information from solar power systems.

[+][Updated 11/27/2020] Norfolk Southern UpdateLast month, Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC) announced a joint venture - Rail Pulse - to adopt GPS and other telematics technology, which will help in real-time track level visibility and total load visibility among other benefits. The aim is to provide enhanced safety and service to shippers. This will help strengthen Norfolk Southern’s Intermodal offering, which refers to the shipment of containers that can be moved from one form of transport to another. Currently, the trucking industry in the U.S. is running at a high capacity along with a rise in pricing, a trend that is expected to continue in the near term. Norfolk Southern is trying to woo shippers to use its Intermodal services as an alternative. The company has been focused on expanding its Intermodal offering, and it has also benefited from the tight capacity for the trucking industry, especially after the electronic logging device mandate full implementation in 2018. Norfolk Southern’s Intermodal segment revenues have grown 27% between 2016 and 2019, which compares with 12% growth for its Coal Freight segment, and a 10% growth for its Merchandise Freight segment. Diving a little deeper, Intermodal growth was driven by a mix of growth in both volume and pricing. With volume growing 9%, pricing rose 17% over the same period.While the Rail Pulse platform will take more than a year to be operational, Norfolk Southern is still likely to see a better growth for its Intermodal segment, compared to the other two segments benefiting from capacity constraints in the trucking industry. That said, Norfolk Southern stock currently appears to be expensive in our view. NSC stock has risen 2x since March lows, and at the current price of $242, it is trading at 26x its 2020 expected EPS of $9.10, compared to levels of 16x and 19x seen in 2018 and 2019 respectively, implying the stock is vulnerable to downside risk. Our dashboard, Buy Or Sell Norfolk Southern Stock, provides more details.[Updated 10/25/2020] Norfolk Southern Stock Price MoveAfter an 82% rise since the March 23 lows of this year, at the current price of around $217 per share we believe Norfolk Southern’s stock (NYSE: NSC) has reached its near-term potential. NSC stock has rallied from $119 to $217 off the recent bottom compared to the S&P which moved 54%, with the resumption of economic activities as lockdowns are gradually lifted. NSC stock is also up roughly 60% from levels seen in early 2018, two years ago.NSC stock is 4% above the levels it was at before the drop in February due to the coronavirus outbreak becoming a pandemic. This seems to make it fully valued as, in reality, demand and revenues will likely be lower than last year.Some of the rise of the last 2 years is justified by the roughly 7.1% growth seen in Norfolk Southern’s revenues from 2017 to 2019. While the company’s Net Margins on a GAAP basis contracted from 51.2% to 24.1%, margins were higher in 2017 due to one-time tax adjustments related to changes in the tax law. On an adjusted basis, Norfolk Southern’s margins actually improved from 18.2% to 24.1%.With the steady revenue and earnings growth over recent years, Norfolk Southern’s P/E multiple has also expanded. We believe the stock is vulnerable to downside risk after the recent rally and the potential weakness from a recession driven by the Covid outbreak. Our dashboard - What Factors Drove 59% Change in Norfolk Southern Stock between 2017 and now? - has the underlying numbers.Norfolk Southern’s P/E multiple changed from 7x in 2017 to 18x in 2019. While the company’s P/E is now 21x, there is a downside risk when the current P/E is compared to levels seen in the past years. P/E of 15x at the end of 2018 and 18x as recently as late 2019.So what’s the likely trigger and timing for downside?TREFISThe global spread of Covid-19 has meant restrictions on movement, resulting in lower demand for power, and in turn, lower demand for coal. While the electricity consumption is expected to decline 2% in the US in 2020, the coal production is estimated to plunge 26% [1]. Norfolk Southern’s coal freight revenue plunged 55% to $209 million in Q2 2020 and it is down 44% to $507 million for the first half of 2020. Other than coal, the company’s merchandise freight revenue was down 26% due to a massive 63% drop in automotive freight, impacted by the lockdowns imposed during the period. We currently forecast a 14% decline in total sales for 2020. Norfolk Southern’s earnings will likely see a similar decline.The actual recovery and its timing hinge on the broader containment of the coronavirus spread. Our dashboard Trends In U.S. Covid-19 Cases provides an overview of how the pandemic has been spreading in the U.S. and contrasts with trends in Brazil and Russia. Following the Fed stimulus — which set a floor on fear — the market has been willing to “look through” the current weak period and take a longer-term view. With investors focusing their attention on 2021 results, the valuations become important in finding value. Though market sentiment can be fickle, and evidence of an uptick in new cases could spook investors once again. At the current price of $215, NSC stock is trading at 25x the 2020 earnings estimate of $8.70 per share, and 20x the 2021 earnings estimate of $10.70, compared to levels of 15x and 18x seen in 2018 and 2019 respectively, making the stock vulnerable to downside risk.TREFISWhat if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead?

US Foods is a mighty foodservice distributor with approximately 350,000 products in its lineup and a major player in the restaurant industry’s supply chain. It should be noted that the foods distribution sector was severely hit this year. As evident, US Foods revenues declined a 12% year-over-year so far (first three quarters of 2020). While the company’s stock is still down 27% year-to-date, we believe that the stock could see a modest upside from the current levels in the short-term, riding on the optimism of the vaccine trial results. But the vaccine relief rally could be hit by the reality of escalating Covid-19 hospitalizations across multiple states in the medium-term. That said, US Foods stock has the potential to see a strong upside once the Covid-19 fear abates. This is based on the company’s $1 billion of cash on hand and $2.7 billion of total liquidity, providing all the cash needed to safeguard from the current downturn. This is also taking into account the company’s revenue growth of 7% year-over-year in 2019. US Foods could likely grow back its sales of restaurant-quality ingredients quickly as consumers make their way back to their favorite eateries post-pandemic.US Foods stock has largely underperformed the broader markets between fiscal 2017 and now. The company’s stock is around 4% lower than it was at the end of fiscal 2017, compared to 34% growth in the S&P. Our dashboard, What Factors Drove 4% Decline in US Foods’ Stock Between Fiscal 2017 and Now? provides the key numbers behind our thinking, and we explain more below.US Foods stock grew 31% from around $32 in 2017 to around $42 in 2019. During this period, US Foods revenues grew 7%. A crucial factor in the rise in the company’s stock price was the markets re-valuing the company at a higher P/S multiple from 0.3 in 2017 to 0.4 in 2019. The company’s P/S is down to about 0.3x now, given the volatility of the current situation, and we expect it to increase slightly in the near term.How Is Coronavirus Impacting US Foods Stock?For Q3, US Foods saw demand rebound, but the numbers were still below 2019 levels. The company’s revenue grew nearly 30% sequentially from $ 4.5 billion in Q2 2020 to $5.8 billion in Q3 2020. But the revenues were still down 10% from year-ago quarter levels. In addition, the company’s total organic case volume decreased 22.2% during the quarter. Independent restaurant case volume decreased 6.8%, while organic independent restaurant case volume decreased 20.0%.US Foods is a major player in the restaurant industry’s supply chain. The company also has a diversified portfolio of products and brands, including the recently bought cash and carry Smart Foodservice (acquired April 2020) and regional food distributor SGA’s Food Group of Companies (acquired Sept. 2019). Coming quarters could still be a little difficult for the company as the restaurant industry won’t recover fully until the vaccine is administered at scale and rolled out widely.TREFISWhat if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead?

What Do Their Employees Have To Say? Are Executives Even Listening?'],"['Black Friday promotion sale on laptop and phone screen. Young man doing shopping onlineRetailers have been trying for years to extend the holiday shopping season to the weeks before Black Friday to no avail. The pandemic drops a bomb into the laps of every American and BOOM — more than half of consumers (56 percent) have already begun shopping for holiday according to our survey this week. Granted, this is likely due in part to worry around the next wave in the pandemic, and possibilities that presents may not get delivered in time (48 percent of consumers we surveyed are concerned about shipment delays and items not arriving on time; Millennials in particular are most worried at 60 percent). But you have to admit, it feels good to have more time to shop. And I won’t miss having to get up before dawn on Black Friday, grabbing coffee and standing in line at the stores for the best deals – which I have to admit I have NEVER done.This week, the National Retail Federation forecasted a strong holiday shopping season, with sales during November and December increasing between 3.6 percent and 5.2 percent over 2019 to a total between $755.3 billion and $766.7 billion, as consumers are willing to spend on gifts that lift the spirits of family and friends after such a challenging year.NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said, “Consumers have experienced a difficult year but will likely spend more than anyone would have expected just a few months ago.”Retailers of yesteryear may not have been ready to handle the surge, not to mention changing expectations by consumers.  Thanks to measures retailers have been taking to innovate since the Spring, they are more prepared than ever to meet, exceed and benefit from new innovations. And, with 80 percent of consumers planning to shop both online and in-store this holiday season, compared to only 20 percent planning to shop only in-store, retailers will at long last be able to meet them with a true, omnichannel Black Friday experience.Many retailers and brands are ready to bridge consumer worry about gifts not arriving on time with in-store and online experiences. We found a 70-percent year-over-year increase in the number of consumers planning to utilize curbside pickup this holiday season (34 percent this year versus 20 percent last year). And this can lead to even more spending.Target saw curbside pickup sales rise more than 700% in the last quarter, per CNBC which reported that customers who try the service go on to spend more both online and in stores. Best Buy’s online revenue jumped 242% in the second quarter, and about 41% of those online sales were attributed to curbside pickup or buy online and pickup in-store (BOPIS).According to this recent Forbes piece, Macy’s (M) has decided that it will close on-site shopping for two of its department stores in Dover, DE, and Littleton, CO for the holidays in order to convert the locations to more easily facilitate in-store and curbside pickup of online orders and product returns. Interestingly, Amazon is also trying this approach with Whole Foods.Given these experiments, I wonder if executive have even consider asking employees to provide thoughtful information and feedback though out the process as they interact daily with customers?The holiday season presents an ideal opportunity to tap into the “voice of employees” and bolster employee experiences, whether that is asking them about precautions that make them feel safest, or gathering their input on product assortment and pricing based on first-hand knowledge of consumer preferences. These kinds of insights can inform strategies and business practices that can uncover untapped revenue opportunities in-store and online.I have seen it personally happen both at our company and a number of successful retailers and brands though out the COVID pandemic. It just requires a desire of executives to want to LISTEN.From early on Greg realized there was a better way for retailers to make decisions, and devoted himself to revolutionizing the retail industry.

The holidays are the most important period of the year for retailers, and stores want to maximize sales in what has been a challenging year for many in the industry. Of course, this year will be different because of the pandemic. Studies show that more consumers are planning to shop online on Black Friday this year than in stores.Retailers have been publicizing Black Friday deals far in advance of the Friday after Thanksgiving, hoping to pull shopper demand forward and avoid crowded stores. The nation’s largest retailers decided to move the biggest deals online to reduce crowds and spread out the season amid the coronavirus pandemic.The coronavirus pandemic has upended consumer shopping, accelerating the trend toward e-commerce and turning the focus of people’s spending to their homes and even autos. For this article we turn our focus to retail stocks. There are 172 exchange-listed retail stocks in AAII’s Stock Investor Pro, scattered across nine industry segments including apparel, auto, computer, drug, home furnishing, home improvement, discount, department and specialty.To find the top retail stocks with upward earnings revisions, attractive profitability and strong price momentum, we created a special screening filter. The first filter required passing companies to have a weighted relative strength price rank of 60% or higher. The weighted relative strength examines price momentum over the last year but gives emphasis to the performance over the most recent 13 weeks. Stocks with strong price momentum tend to continue outperforming the market.Next, the retail stocks screen required upward revision over the last three months in the consensus earnings estimate for the current and next fiscal year, highlighting firms with improving prospects. The table below lists the expected earnings per share estimate for the current and next fiscal year and indicates the percentage improvement of each estimate over the last three months.The special retail stocks screen also sought out companies with gross margins higher than the median for their industry group. This ratio reflects the pricing decisions of a company as well as the costs of purchasing merchandise. It is the ratio of the gross income of a company (sales less cost of goods sold) to its sales for the same period. The higher the gross margin and the more stable it is over time, the greater the company’s expected profitability.Finally, the retail stocks screen required that the inventory turnover ratio be equal to or better than the median for the industry. It is the ratio of cost of goods sold to average inventory. This ratio approximates the number of times inventory is used and replenished over the course of the reporting period, which is 12 months for our analysis. A higher ratio indicates that inventory does not languish in warehouses or on store shelves.AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF INDIVIDUAL INVESTORSSeven companies made the retail stocks screen list, and they are ranked by relative price strength. The quick ratio is listed in the table to provide a simple measure of financial liquidity. The quick ratio adds cash and accounts receivable from the balance sheet and divides that figure by current liabilities—higher figures are better. The price-to-sales ratio gives an indication of the valuation levels of the stocks making the retail stocks screen list.Three Retail Stocks to ConsiderThe coronavirus pandemic has shifted the way most consumers approach shopping. Certain companies have been clear beneficiaries of the coronavirus pandemic, as consumers’ behaviors have changed, and people stayed close to home.Of the seven retail stocks we identified with upward earnings revisions, attractive profitability and strong price momentum, let’s evaluate Williams-Sonoma, Zumiez and 1-800-Flowers.com using AAII’s A+ Stock Grades to determine how attractive the three retail stocks are based on their fundamentals today.AAII’s A+ Stock Grades is a stock-grading system based on percentile rankings of multiple key metrics within five investment factors: value, growth, momentum, earnings estimate revisions and quality. The A to F grades for each factor give summary ratings on a company’s fundamentals.The following table summarizes the stock grades for Williams-Sonoma, a specialty retailer selling high-quality home products; Zumiez, a provider of apparel, footwear, accessories and hard goods for teenagers and young adults; and 1-800-Flowers.com, a retailer of fresh-cut flowers, floral and fruit arrangements and gift baskets.AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF INDIVIDUAL INVESTORSWhat the A+ Stock Grades RevealWilliams-Sonoma is a specialty retailer of high-quality home products. The company markets a wide selection of merchandise through its retail stores and websites under the brands Williams Sonoma (cooking and entertaining essentials), Pottery Barn (casual home furnishings), Pottery Barn Kids (stylish children’s furnishings), Pottery Barn Bed + Bath, PBteen, West Elm (affordable home furnishing goods), Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham.The company has established a solid niche in the fragmented $120+ billion domestic home furnishings market, capturing approximately a 5% market share. Its well-known brands have been key factors in supporting the company’s top- and bottom-line growth, due to repeated business from loyal customers. However, there is plenty of room for growth; there are few large competitors in the kids and teen space. The company has leveraged its e-commerce assets such that its e-commerce business accounts for a majority of total revenue.Williams-Sonoma has a very positive A+ Estimate Revisions Grade of A, which is based on the magnitude of a company’s last two earnings surprises, using the SUE (standardized unexpected earnings) score, and the percentage change in the consensus estimate for the current fiscal year over the last month and last three months.With its stock up over 46% for the year, Williams-Sonoma has a Value Grade of C, based on its score of 47, which is considered average. The company’s Value Score ranking is based on several traditional valuation metrics. The company has a score of 38 for the price-to-sales ratio, 57 for the price-to-free-cash-flow ratio and 82 for the price-to-book-value ratio (the lower the score the better for value).The company has a B grade when it comes to price momentum based on the weighted four-quarter relative strength. Momentum is based on the price change of a stock over a specified period relative to all other stocks. Williams-Sonoma has a strong A+ Growth Grade of B, which looks at growth in sales, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and operating cash.Zumiez is a specialty retailer of apparel, footwear, accessories and hardgoods for young men and women through the fashion, music, art and culture of action sports, streetwear and other lifestyles. The company operates under the names Zumiez, Blue Tomato and Fast Times.It offers various categories of shoes—such as skate shoes, casual shoes, high tops, sandals, slip-ons, runners and boots—and shoe accessories, such as socks. It also offers flannels, hoodies, baseball hats, windbreakers, t-shirts, jackets, jerseys, sweaters, tank tops, sweatshirts, cardigans, skirts, jeans, joggers, leggings and dresses, among others. It provides various accessories, including watches, sunglasses, bracelets, earrings, rings, beanies, hats, belts, wallets and phone accessories.Zumiez has a strong A+ Growth Grade of B, which looks at quarterly year-over-year growth in sales, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and operating cash, as well as annualized growth over the last five years for these three elements. The company saw operating cash increase by over 214% for its latest quarter versus one year ago.The company has a Value Grade of A, based on its score of 18, which is in the deep value range.

The company saw sales increase by over 51% for its latest quarter versus one year ago.The company has a B grade when it comes to price momentum, based on the weighted four-quarter relative strength. Momentum is based on the price change of a stock over a specified period relative to all other stocks. It is considered to be an anomaly in the analysis of stock returns because stocks with high relative levels of momentum tend to continue to outperform, while stocks with low relative levels of momentum tend to continue underperforming.____The stocks meeting the criteria of the approach do not represent a “recommended” or “buy” list.

That is obvious. But what if stocks rise and the value of money falls? Is that a crash? If the value of money drops 30% but the market rises a little, is that a bull market?Not many people would argue against the premise that it is the Federal Reserve’s liquidity actions that have levitated the U.S. stock market. Sadly, in an attempt to keep the whole economy from imploding it has inflated stock asset values to ridiculous levels. Jay Powell, the Fed Chairman, made it clear in a recent interview that they were committed to supporting the U.S. economy and to protecting it from the effects of anti-Covid measures, for as long as necessary and for as much as needed, and clearly indicated that would be for a long time.This is the trend of that Federal Reserve support:The Federal Reserve's total assets(Chart courtesy of the Federal Reserve’s website)This QE or however you want to brand this liquidity provision (liquidity equals cash, provision equals printing assets that turn into money) is clearly going to run and run for a long time because every time the Fed slackens its swapping of fresh government-backed quality assets for other people’s sketchier assets, down flops the stock market and then up pops more QE to keep the market from crashing Hindenburg-like in flames.When the Fed tapered in 2019, down went the market and crash went peripheral global economies as U.S. dollars were sucked from the global economic plumbing. The U.S. and the world economy is hooked on the Federal Reserve’s money printing. By swapping golden government debt for other parties’ riskier, perhaps very risky, debt the Fed yanks the world’s dodgy assets holders out of the mire by their hair, thus avoiding a spiral of insolvency. The potential damage of that terrifying comeuppance is what sparks all bailouts, allowing broken companies and economies to stagger on, most likely towards even greater fragility.The weird thing is this: If these liquidity operations keep going on, the Federal Reserve will in effect own all its citizens’ homes and all its creditworthy (and not so creditworthy) corporate debt and thus have liens on most of the economic assets of its citizens and producers. It will have in effect nationalized, though probably by accident, the country, having bought it with government paper. However, if it brings this process to a halt the market will crash and everyone will instantly be a lot poorer, while if it carries on at some point it will glut the market for its paper, up will go interest rates and down will go the value of bonds and the reality of a much poorer economy will bite.However, it seems that the Federal Reserve is not going to let the stock market crash whatever the outcome.But if a dollar in 2023 or 2024 buys significantly less and the market hasn’t rocketed accordingly, you are getting your reset in a chronic way rather than through an acute event of a 30% retrenchment on your portfolio. This will be the aim, once again to smooth the process by spreading it out over a decade or two rather than take the pain in an awful three or so years of restructuring.Yet make no mistake, the U.S. stock market is a house of cards, and as the Malaysians discovered when they propped up the price of tin, there is a finite nature to keeping a market away from its natural equilibrium and you must spend increasing amounts to do it. At some point you run out of credit and down goes the market to its correct level. How long the U.S. can continue to debase its credit while maintaining its credibility is the key question in this ongoing drama and every country in its time has gone beyond that point and sunk into crisis. If the U.S. chooses to corner its markets, that time will approach rapidly. With continued QE the system will become more fragile still so to the catalyst needed to breach that fixed market corner will get smaller and smaller until the slightest of nudges will break the spell.Inflation solves all these problems as it gives the flexibility for economic activity to rebalance as few can keep up with all the different developing prices. It creates impetus for people to get their money moving and crushes debt with negative real interest rates and also stealthily rebalances the actual value of those debts. Switching inflation on and off is a known, even though central banks ludicrously claim otherwise.But will the stock market crash now? Hearing Jay Powell speak it appears they are prepared to die on the hill of QE. So the market will not be allowed to take its natural course. This means the market will crash but only when and if there is a downfall moment. There has to be a readjustment for a global economy that has lost at least 10% of its output with still more damage to come.Some governments will aim for a chronic economic development while some will go for an acute one if they can shift its blame onto someone or something else.As such, investors should pray that the new incoming U.S. administration doesn’t find a neat scapegoat to blame a reset on, to get that out of the way early in their term.For anyone who is not a diehard buy and holder, the near future must be one where an investor’s fingers should stay hovering near that sell button because the tightrope walk the Fed is walking for the sake of the U.S. and world economy is going to be a precarious one.Clem Chambers is the CEO of private investors website ADVFN.com and author of 101 Ways to Pick Stock Market Winners and Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner’s Guide.Chambers won Journalist of the Year in the Business Market Commentary category in the State Street U.K. Institutional Press Awards in 2018.I am the CEO of stocks and investment website ADVFN .

PE has been hot in recent years, and the trends show no sign of it slowing down. Experts from the Apex Group explained some of the trends involving ESG and private equity.Norihiro Takahashi, president of the Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), speaks during an ESG ... [+]Elaine Chim, head of private equity and real estate for the Americas with the Apex Group, explained to me that there\'s a lot of evidence suggesting that PE as an asset class, consistently outperforms the public markets. She said the pandemic might have disrupted PE\'s momentum, but investor appetite for private market opportunities hasn\'t dissipated at all over the last seven months. ""There has been a significant uptick in distressed and special situation opportunities as well as the emergence of dislocation funds,"" Chim said. ""In addition, the social impact of the pandemic has accelerated the industry\'s awareness of environmental and societal issues, pushing forward the agenda of aligning ESG related issues with financial return and decision making. The private equity industry thrives in times of crisis because it is so adaptable and has the ability to mobilize and deploy capital quickly, securing jobs and contributing to economic recovery. If it can do all of that with an ESG focused lens, that is even better for society at large.""She expects private equity to remain an increasing area of allocation for investors because the model is well-suited to crises. Chim expects the volumes of distressed deal activity alone to continue increasing because falling valuations have created opportunities for those with capital to deploy. She also expects private credit to play an essential role in helping revive the economy after the pandemic. Chim explained that the pandemic had a significant impact on the PE industry and caused immediate disruptions. ""For example, fund managers had to think about business continuity, ongoing regulatory compliance and maintaining business as usual whilst facing real obstacles like implementing working from home infrastructure, lack of face-to-face meetings and liquidity shortfalls becoming a reality among portfolio companies,"" she said.  One benefit the PE industry has going for it is that it is adaptable and faster at deploying capital than the public markets. ""With so much dry powder ready to invest, it is in a good position to access deals and drive meaningful recovery,"" Chim said. ""The industry will have a key strategic role in rebuilding the economy through rapid, targeted capital deployment. We expect to see a key vintage of funds resulting out of COVID-19, which will be strong, sector-specific and forward looking.""Ethical investing has been sweeping the asset management industry for years, so it should come as no surprise that private equity is not untouched. Some PE firms do look at ESG factors when deciding where to invest. Andy Pitts-Tucker, managing director of Apex ESG ratings and advisory, notes that there have long been exclusion funds which don\'t invest in specific industries and impact funds which include ESG as a critical component of their investment strategy. He also said PE firms are increasingly looking at ESG attributes as part of their due diligence process when considering whether to invest in a company. ""A low ESG rating should not be viewed as a \'make or break\' for an acquisition, but the fund should be aware of this as an area which needs to be addressed and improved during the period they hold the asset,"" Pitts-Tucker explained. ""We like to think of underdeveloped ESG policies as an opportunity for private equity to improve the company, rather than a reason to not make an acquisition.""The private markets have been slow to pick up ESG monitoring, and reporting as the task of accessing and analyzing meaningful data on it from private portfolio companies was deemed too difficult. Pitts-Tucker explained that the public markets already have many data collection solutions, providers and indices, but there are few reputable independent global ESG providers for the private markets. He said many questions face the PE industry when it comes to the asset class, like about the most reputable methodology and how to capture data in such a way as to avoid accusations of ""greenwashing."" He also said it\'s essential to think about how private markets can measure performance and source data. ""One of the key challenges for private equity is answering these questions in a way which addresses the inconsistency in how ESG is reflected in investment choices and the absence of an accepted industry or international standard on data formats.,"" Pitts-Tucker said. ""Private markets have been seeking an independent, end-to-end offering not only to ensure relevance, consistency and longevity surrounding the asset class, but also to simply create better, more resilient, profitable and valuable companies.""The governance part of ESG is of particular importance to PE firms, according to Pitts-Tucker. He said many firms have long sought to implement positive governance practices while they are invested in a company. He categorizes greater transparency into ""push"" and ""pull"" factors. ""The dominant driver is that stakeholders are demanding greater ESG reporting, \'pushing\' private equity investors towards ESG,"" Pitts-Tucker said. ""Institutional investors such as pension funds are now considering the ESG policies of the funds they invest in, as part of their fiduciary responsibilities to their underlying investors. We are approaching the time when private equity firms will be required to pass ascreening as part of their vetting process as their investors demand more transparency into the funds\' qualities.""Pitts-Tucker expects more regulations pertaining to ESG and PE to be introduced. He notes that the European Union\'s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation goes into effect in March 2021. The legislation requires funds to understand the ESG status of their portfolio investments and fund managers to report on the sustainability of their assets.The ""pull"" factor he mentioned is that PE funds are facing pressure from employees to make changes that will benefit people and the planet while also contributing to the financial bottom line.I am the founder and CEO of ValueWalk.

Biden Jr. would be the nation’s 46th President, while Senate control (to be determined by two January Georgia runoffs) is likely to remain with Republicans, blocking Democrats' left-leaning big plans. “This is great for American competitiveness,’’ Box CEO Aaron Levie wrote on Twitter, adding that businesses need  stability and “global trade relations that don’t change on a whim.”Of course Biden can do a lot on his own through both executive orders and regulatory policy on everything from the environment to worker and consumer protection. His team is already preparing a list of day one actions—ranging from rejoining the Paris climate accord to restoring protection for “Dreamers”—that will reverse some of President Trump’s moves. But Biden can’t raise taxes on corporations and the wealthy or spend trillions on stimulus or green infrastructure without both houses of Congress being on board. The last president who assumed office without control of both houses of Congress was George H.W. Bush in 1989. That led to a bipartisan deficit-cutting deal that violated his “no new taxes” pledge and arguably helped make him a one term president.

After a couple of years of litigation, the couple reached a settlement on July 10, 2019, the terms of which were placed on the record during a telephone hearing and soon thereafter the settlement was reduced to judgment. As part of the terms settlement, now incorporated into a judgment, Greg was required to make a lump sum payment to Lisa within 120 days, and also Greg was to provide Lisa with a security interest and mortgage in real estate that was owned GLG Farms, LLC, which LLC was solely owned by Greg.But when the 120 days had come and gone, Greg had not made the lump sum payment to Lisa nor had Greg given Lisa the security interest in GLG Farms, LLC. The court was not pleased, and held Greg in contempt — but allowed Greg to stay the contempt if he filed a bond in the amount of $115,000 and executed the mortgage for the real estate owned by GLG Farms, LLC. Otherwise, Greg would get to serve up to 60 days in the pokey. The court later modified that order to provide that if Greg would make a payment of $150,000 to Lisa then he could purge the contempt, and Greg finally made that payment.Greg appealed the judgment and made a variety of arguments, none of which were even modestly successful and only one which is of interest to us here: Whether the court could force Greg to give a security interest and mortgage on the real estate of GLG Farms, LLC.Reduced to its essence, Greg argued that the exclusive remedy that a judgment creditor, such as Lisa, has against a debtor/member\'s interest in an LLC is a charging order, and so instead of Greg being forced to give a security interest and mortgage on the real that was owned by GLG Farms, LLC (and not Greg individually), Lisa should instead be stuck with a charging order that would limit her rights to merely getting whatever distributions came out of GLG Farms, LLC, if any. Indeed, the LLC statute uses the precise term ""exclusive remedy"" in defining a creditor\'s rights against a debtor/member\'s interest in an LLC, and the result urged by Greg is the correct result in most cases, i.e., the general rule.But once again, we have to recall the General Rule of Anglo-American jurisprudence, which is that general rules are generally inapplicable. Here, Greg voluntarily and consensually bartered away a security interest and mortgage in the real estate of GLG Farms, LLC, as part of the settlement, which is very different than a creditor seeking distributions in an ordinary case. Thus:——- BEGIN QUOTE ——-Lisa Grengs is not seeking to obtain distributions from GLG Farms, LLC that would otherwise be payable to Greg Grengs. A charging order has no application to whether or not Greg Grengs can be held in contempt. The question present in this case is not whether Lisa Grengs can pursue collection of Greg Grengs’ liability from assets of the limited liability, the question is whether Greg Grengs has the ability to execute a security interest and mortgage on assets owned by the limited liability company.——- END QUOTE ——-Greg next argued that he couldn\'t be held in contempt because he personally had no ability to give a security interest and mortgage in the property of GLG Farms, LLC — only GLG Farms, LLC could do that. This quite disingenuously overlooked that as the sole owner of GLG Farms, LLC, Greg had total control of the entity and could make it do whatever he wanted:—— BEGIN QUOTE ——-Greg Grengs is the sole owner of GLG Farms, LLC and has exclusive control of GLG Farms, LLC. Greg Grengs offered no evidence to support a finding he does not have the ability to secure the execution of the mortgage from GLG Farms, LLC. He has not argued that he lacks control of GLG Farms, LLC; he has not argued he is prohibited by an operating agreement from encumbering the assets of GLG Farms, LLC; and he has not argued he is otherwise prevented from complying with the terms of the judgment. While it is true the title is held by GLG Farms, LLC, Greg Grengs has failed to demonstrate he does not have the ability to comply with the judgment by executing a security interest and mortgage on behalf of GLG Farms, LLC.——- END QUOTE ——-The bottom line was that Greg could indeed comply with the judgment but simply chose not to do so, and it was not error for the court to hold him in contempt.ANALYSISThis opinion demonstrates that as vehicle to protect one\'s assets from creditors, a single-member LLC (""SMLLC"") isn\'t worth much. The reason is that a court can simply order the debtor to do just about whatever in relation to the entity, such as make it give a security interest and mortgage on the real estate that it holds as here. Which is to say that a court might not be able to technically force the LLC as a non-party to the litigation to do anything, but the court certainly has the contempt power to force the debtor as the single member to do whatever the court wants, including take action on as the manager of the LLC.However, in the creditor-debtor context is critical to distinguish between consensual liens where the debtor has agreed (as Greg did in this case) to place the lien, as opposed to non-consensual liens where a creditor is forcing the placement of a lien onto the interest of the debtor against her wishes. In the first event, where the debtor voluntarily consents to the lien, the charging order procedure is not implicated at all. It is only in the second event, where the debtor does not consent to the lien, and thus the court is forced to place the lien against the debtor\'s wishes, that the charging order procedure is used.But even where the charging order procedure is implicated, it is important to realize that ""exclusive remedy"" is a perhaps poorly-chosen term of art which does mean that the charging order procedure must be used to the exclusion of other remedies, such as a levy or garnishment, but it not the equivalent of ""exclusive outcome"" since there may be other theories — most notably alter ego and reverse veil-piercing theories — that creditors may employ to essentially by-pass the separate legal existence of the LLC and get at the assets within.CITE ASGrengs v.

[+]Now what?Clearly, Wall Street is having a moment – like a drunken Santa arriving a month too soon for Christmas and tossing presents around with no idea what he’s doing. But how sustainable is the rally?Who can say? Irrationality doesn’t have an expiration date. An S&P 500 that’s now trading at an estimated 37x earnings could see 40. It could see 50. Stocks, though wildly overvalued, are not yet stupidly valued, as they were in 1999, just before the tech bubble imploded. At this point, nothing nonsensical is off the table because the madness of crowds – particularly the madness of younger investors who think trees grow to the sky – is compelling Wall Street averages ever higher.That same madness has compelled the Treasury market to historic levels as well. So, basically, neither the S&P, the Dow, the Nasdaq, nor Treasuries are safe. All sit atop Everest, gasping for oxygen.Just remember this: Reversion to the mean is very much a very real thing. Balloons always run out of helium. Always.Mean reversion in the stock market would see the Dow and S&P retreat to valuations most investors can’t imagine – the low teens. That would imply a painfully sharp decline. If the S&P corrected to, say, 15x earnings for 2021, then current expectations of roughly $143 in cumulative earnings per share for the S&P 500 constituents would put the index at 2150, a 40% decline from here.Not saying such a decline will happen in the course of 2021, though not saying it won’t. More likely, investors are looking at subpar returns for many years to come, something like the lost decade that defined in the aughts in the wake of the 2000 tech collapse.But all is not lost. Winners almost always balance out losers, and if the next leg on Wall Street is, in fact, down, then that will very likely play well for value stocks. They’ve underperformed growth stocks for nearly 15 years now, which you can see in this chart from longtermtrends.net, comparing the Wilshire Large-Cap Growth and Large-Cap Value indices:Wins for either Wilshire Large-Cap Growth or Large-Cap Value indices   When the blue line is rising, growth is beating value. When it’s falling, value is winning.The Street has been in an overall growthy phase since about 2007, a phase that has been particularly noticeable since 2016.The gap between growth and value is particularly egregious when you consider each indices’ respective PE ratio. Companies inside the growth index traded at a weighted average PE of about 35. Those inside the value index are less than half that level at 16.What this says is that now is the time to practice some prudence. If you’re going to remain invested in stocks, begin trading growth for value. In the last 40+ years, the Wilshire Growth/Value ratio has only once exceeded the current level. And, yes, it continued climbing to moonshot levels. Will it again?Waiting to find out could prove painful.The world has not yet moved past the pandemic. Though vaccines are in the works, global inoculation remains many, many months away. That’s plenty of time for the economic effects of a wave of bankruptcies, evictions, and foreclosures to rip through the US economy and cause all sorts of angst on Wall Street. The next round of stimulus is not forthcoming just yet and, frankly, given the date on the calendar, it’s highly unlikely that struggling American families will see a check from Uncle Sam before early next year. Again, plenty for time for a dismal Christmas season to scare Wall Street sober.And a surging coronavirus in Europe, and particularly across mask-averse America, could still explode with devastating consequences to life and (of lesser importance) financial markets.So, while the Dow mainlines euphoria at 30,000, the prudent investor might stop to consider history and recognize that, A) extreme valuations are never long for this world; and, B) plenty of sparks exist to ignite the bombs that could blow apart the stock market. If so, pricey growth stocks, as is always the case, will be the first to feel the pain. As cash flees those fleetest of stocks, it will, as it routinely does, dive into the safety of value.That’s where the smart money should now be headed.I am a former Wall Street Journal Money & Investing/Personal Journal writer, and a former hedge-fund research analyst and trader.

NHTSA\'s recall targeted only a small number of 2016 Model Xs (9,136), those made from September 17, 2015 to July 30th 2016, an estimated 10% of Model X production during that time period.  Not applying primer to an applique is a pretty dumb mistake—an unnamed supplier was referenced, but not named in the NHTSA document—but in the past 30 years of following autos I have seen some real howlers.  Lack of a dealer network makes it more expensive for Tesla to conduct such repairs, but fixing 9.136 Xs will not upset the Tesla apple cart.  What is striking about this NHTSA action is its relative speed.  NHTSA’s documentation notes that its Field Quality department was made aware of a Model X incident on September 21, 2020.  Field Quality made contact with Tesla management on November 10th of this year, and that led to the recall notice occurring yesterday.  I have been following the U.S. car industry in some form for the past 30 years, and in my experience, to go from incident to recall in under two months is EXTREMELY fast for NHTSA.This relatively minor recall on the 2016 Model X should not obscure the two much, much larger investigations currently underway at NHTSA for Model S and X vehicles with the same production vintage.  From the outside, this would seem like an effort by Tesla to placate NHTSA on a relatively minor issue to continue delaying potential recalls on more substantial issues. The other regulatory issues facing Tesla would be potentially much more costly. As excellently reported by CNBC’s Lora Kolodny, Tesla faces a NHTSA investigation of Media Control Unit (MCU) failures causing rearview camera blackouts  on 2012-2015 Model S.  This is clearly a hardware issue, and the chip involved in the investigation, a NAND Nvidia Tegra, was used in a total of 159,000 Tesla vehicles bu NHTSA’s count, as noted in NHTSA’s ODI document:Tesla used the same MCU with the Tegra 3 processor in approximately 159 thousand 2012-2018 Model S and 2016-2018 Model X vehicles built by Tesla through early-2018. So, that’s a much bigger issue than a defective applique, and is clearly a hardware problem with the Tegra chip. If that chip does in fact “die"" after a given number of print-erase (PE) cycles, then every Tesla made in the subject time period would have to be recalled. NHTSA noted that:According to Tesla, for subject vehicles equipped with the NVIDIANVDA+0.2% Tegra 3 processor with an integrated 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory device, the eMMC NAND cell hardware can fail when reaching lifetime wear, for which the eMMC controller has no available blocks to recover. With this failure mode, the only recovery available is a replacement of the eMMC device, achieved by physical part replacement of either the MCU assembly or visual control module subcomponentI see no remedy for this other than replacement of the MCU, which is imported from China and now subject to tariff, as Tesla noted in a recent lawsuit versus the U.S. government.  Tesla’s over-the-air mitigation actions might lead to a slightly slower death rate for the impacted MCUs, but as NHTSA noted: Tesla indicated that the MCU failures are likely to continue to occur in subject vehicles as vehicles continue to operate and use available memory in the 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory until 100% of units have failed. Those models will have to be recalled eventually.  Tesla’s regulatory counsel, Elizbeth Myktiuk, is (per her LinkedIn page) a former NHTSA employee, and clearly, as usual, Musk and co. are going for a stall-stall-stall strategy.  Best case for Tesla is that the MCU recall doesn’t occur until 2021 and these costs do not have to be booked in full-year 2020 results.  That’s a longshot, in my opinion.  Analyzing the NHTSA documents also shows the presence of a NHTSA investigation into Tesla’s “white whale,” sudden unintended acceleration.  This is not a conspiracy theory posited by cranks on Twitter, but is a live investigation, that in true NHTSA fashion was opened in January of this year.  Like most government agencies, NHTSA is slow and bureaucratic, but the NHTSA Investigations shows 10 different pieces of correspondence between Tesla and the government since the investigation was initially opened, so clearly, there is some “there” there.  The main problem for Tesla is that its vehicles are packed with so much hardware that the corresponding software actually catches ample amounts of data, some of which can be found in the documents filed in NHTSA’s Investigations page.  I have lived through SUA claims against Audi (which dragged on for five years) and Toyota, but none of those OEMs’ cars produced the massive data deluge that all TeslasTSLA+2% do.  So, there is much less “he-said she-said” for Tesla, and ultimately NHTSA’s engineers will decide whether recalls are necessary.  These issues point to key facts ignored by the stock-pushers and banking fee-receivers who “follow” Tesla for Wall Street banks never mention:1) Tesla is underreserved for any major recall.  After booking a provision of $175 million for warranty expenses in the third quarter, Tesla\'s warranty reserve stood at $1.269 billion as of September 3oth.  That’s a very small amount compared to Tesla\'s annual production rate, especially for a company that does not have a dealer network.  With China’s State Administration for Market Regulation issuing a recall in October for Models S and X made from 2013 to 2017 due to Tesla\'s “whompy wheel” suspension issue, and the impact of yesterday\'s recall, I would expect Tesla to have to provision much more heavily for warranty in its 4Q2020 earnings report.  Year-end figures are considered definitive by the SEC (and are audited,)  so every public company reflects a degree of conservatism in them with regards to reserves rarely seen in quarterly figures.  2) Tesla’s awful performance in quality evaluation surveys—most recently Consumer Reports after a terrible performance  in the most recent J.D Power survey—actually has a financial cost.  Making bad cars is no way to make big profits.  The Models S and X produced from 2012-2018 not only contributed to Tesla\'s  cumulative, multibillion-dollar net loss in those 6 years, but they will live on Tesla\'s balance sheet as potential liabilities for years to come.  I just don\'t  know how to express that any more clearly and it saddens me—although it doesn\'t surprise me— that Tesla\'s “analyst” community pays zero attention to potential liabilities.   Every consumer products company—from GM to Johnson and Johnson—faces potential  liability costs from defective products. Tesla\'s  $500 billion valuation reflects excitement (and fund positioning) ahead of S&P 500 inclusion, but investors should remember  that GM and J&JJILL+0.9% are in the S&P 500, too.  That is supposed to bring more scrutiny on an included company\'s  financials, not less, and Tesla\'s day in the sun will come.I have researched stocks for 27 years, starting fresh out of college at Lehman Brothers and then moving to Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) now sits just below 30,000 in pre-market trading after topping it yesterday, and there’s a chance this milestone moment could draw some new cash into the market, according to one school of thought.While 30,000 is just a number, as we noted here yesterday, it’s an attention grabber. All those headlines probably got noticed by people who may not have been invested or who just hadn’t cared enough before to put more money into the market. Now they may be wondering what they missed. The post-Thanksgiving period could be interesting in determining whether cash on the sidelines starts to roll in.Having said that, the market has come a long way very quickly, so caution could be the word of the day. Long-term investors should consider how they got here and not get carried away by all this optimism. There’s possibly a reckoning up ahead when people realize there’s a long way to go before the country recovers from the pandemic, and that an effective vaccine may be one thing but getting it produced and in the arms of those who need it is extremely complicated.The mood this morning seems a bit subdued ahead of the holiday, and profit-taking could creep in after the big rally and before people go home for their turkey tomorrow. If history is any guide, we shouldn’t expect much direction from today and Friday’s sessions, though things may get choppy due to low volume. Instead, it might be better to wait until everyone’s back Monday for more clues about where things might go next.This morning did bring some earnings news, with Deere (DE) having a nice quarter and shares rising in pre-market trading despite DE just missing analysts’ average revenue estimate. Critically, the company said demand for its heavy equipment is improving, which could be another sign of the world’s economy continuing to recover. DE became one of a number of firms recently to issue solid 2021 guidance, and that seems to be more in focus than the revenue miss.There’s also some data ahead of the holiday. Weekly initial jobless claims came in a day early and totaled 778,000, above average Wall Street estimates for the second straight week. This figure has remained stubbornly high, reinforcing ideas that the economy still has a long way to go. Meanwhile, seasonally adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 33.1% in Q3 was the same as last time, so no big deal there. The market’s shown no reaction to these numbers ahead of the opening bell.With so many headlines centered on 30,000 (see chart below), you might have missed some other key developments.First of all, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) clawed over 3600 again, a level it’s had trouble holding in previous rallies. We’ll see if it has more luck this time. Second, a closely watched economic barometer, copper, hit nearly three-year highs (see more below). Meanwhile, gold keeps sinking and threatens to slip below $1,800 an ounce for the first time since July.In addition, the Russell 2000 Index (RUT) of small-cap stocks set a new record high Tuesday. Often the RUT is thought of as an index that best reflects the domestic economy, since its smaller stocks tend to have less international exposure. The RUT has been on a roll lately, up 23% since the end of September. In comparison, the SPX is up just 7.5% over the same time frame.These things—along with a Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) now flirting with its post-pandemic lows —suggest a “risk-on” trade really taking hold after some fits and starts earlier this month.However, it’s important not to get carried away, because a few economic signals aren’t exactly lighting up the room and a tough winter may be ahead due to COVID-19. Also, some contrary indicators like investor sentiment hit high levels recently. Some market watchers say this can sometimes suggest weakness ahead. VIX popped back above 22 this morning and the bond market seems to be getting a slight bid. Crude, however, continues to soar and sits at post-pandemic highs above $45 a barrel.The question as we head into Wednesday’s session—likely to feature light-volume pre-holiday trading—is whether these gains can hold. The pattern in recent weeks is that stocks roar out of the starting gate and then slowly tire as the weekend finish line approaches. You can’t necessarily rule out profit-taking today and Friday (a holiday-shortened session), but there is a little less geopolitical worry compared with a few weeks ago. It’s possible geopolitics played at least some role in making people nervous about holding long positions into the last two weekends.Whatever ultimately happens, volume is likely to be light the remainder of the week, meaning the action could get judged as less meaningful. Market Update won’t publish tomorrow, but will return Friday morning.One cautionary note popped up Tuesday when headline consumer confidence for November failed to meet analysts’ expectations at 96.1 (the consensus on Wall Street had been 96.5, according to research firm Briefing.com). The figure was also down from October’s upwardly revised 101.4. More alarmingly, the Expectations figure fell pretty dramatically from October to below 90 for the first time since August. “Attitudes about business conditions for the next six months have worsened,” Briefing.com said.That’s just one data point, but combined with some other ones recently it doesn’t necessarily point to continued meteoric gains. There also appears to be what analysts call “froth” in the market, like Tesla’s TSLA +2% (TSLA) shares rolling up 6% gains Tuesday despite a lack of news. This isn’t to rain on anyone’s parade, only to say that long-term investors should consider avoiding the urge to get caught up in the FOMO, or “fear of missing out” kind of trading that can happen at times like these.Don’t count out possible spillover strength from media reports this week that President-elect Biden could choose ex-Fed Chairman Janet Yellen for Treasury secretary. It’s a good probability that Yellen’s name helped the market gain traction Tuesday thanks to her reputation as a policy dove and someone who’s hands-on about trying to help the economy (and by association, the markets). Certainty around the election and cabinet appears to have helped market confidence.The Fed already has already committed to long-term low rates, so having Yellen down the street from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell sounded pretty good to many investors. Speaking of Powell, Fed minutes from their last meeting are due for release later today. So are the monthly Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) prices, an inflation gauge the Fed watches closely.CHART OF THE DAY: THE LONG ROAD TO DOW 30K. The venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average ... [+]Mega-Caps Take the Sidelines: If you’re lucky, maybe you can remember that amazing feeling the first time you swam across a pool by yourself as a kid, with no mom, dad, or teacher helping you out. In a way, the entire market might be enjoying that feeling right now, because it’s not just staying afloat but actually getting close to lapping all-time highs without much support from Apple AAPL +0.5% (AAPL) or the other “mega-cap” stocks. These six stocks—which also include both share classes of Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon AMZN +0.3% (AMZN), Facebook (FB), and Microsoft MSFT +0.6% (MSFT)—continue to make up a hefty percentage of the S&P 500 Index (SPX) on a valuation basis, and still accounted for a big amount of the SPX’S 2020 total return through mid-November. In recent weeks, however, their influence has waned a bit. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI), which includes MSFT and AAPL, surpassed 30,000 on Tuesday even though neither MSFT nor AAPL were among its top-10 daily gainers. AAPL has actually had a pretty tough week and is flat over the last month.In a sense, it feels like the market’s training wheels are off, or it’s making that first solo doggy-paddle across the pool. While AAPL and MSFT both rose Tuesday, it was companies like Boeing BA -0.5% (BA), JP Morgan (JPM), Chevron CVX -0.9% (CVX), and Goldman Sachs GS -0.5% (GS) leading the $DJI higher. It’s just one day, but the trend lately has favored the more “cyclical” sectors that tend to do better in an improving economy. Energy, Financials, and Industrials easily outperformed Info Tech and Communication Services over the last month, and that feels like a positive trend.Separate Ways: Gold’s having an interesting week on the charts that might reflect more investors embracing risk. It fell below a firm support line near $1,850 on the charts that had held pretty much since mid-summer, and finished just above $1,800. Maybe monitor this market to see if the trend can hold. Gold is now down double-digits from its August all-time high, putting it officially into correction territory. It’s still up sharply year-to-date, however.A metal that tends to zig when gold zags is copper, and it’s also worth watching for insight into the global economy. Copper, if you haven’t noticed, has been on an absolute tear, corresponding in part with the rally in electric vehicle stocks (EVs use more copper than normal cars). Copper closed above $3.30 on Tuesday and is near levels last seen in December 2017.Giving Thanks: Despite the market’s recent advance, there’s still a lot of economic and illness-related stress across the country. Let’s not forget this on Thanksgiving, and also let’s remember to be thankful to so many people in the medical profession, first responders, food workers, teachers and everyone else who continue to face Covid-19 exposure through the very nature of their jobs. Not everyone has the choice to stay at home. We all hope a vaccine becomes available soon to protect these courageous employees.TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

The National Retail Federation (NRF) pegs overall holiday sales gains of 3.6% to 5.2%—a wide swing by most assessments that underscores the level of uncertainty on consumer spending this year. The International Council of Shopping Centers has a tighter, lower forecast of a 1.9% gain in sales.Friday’s session wraps up at 1 p.m. ET, three hours earlier than normal. Don’t be surprised if trading is thin and choppy, because many investors and traders probably took the day off. Check for media reports throughout the day on how Black Friday is going, but it won’t necessarily be like in the past with reporters following customers around big-box stores. It might be a bit harder to get a feel for how things are going.E-commerce sales could knock the ball out of the park, though. An Accenture ACN +0.3% survey found 75% of consumers plan to head to their favorite easy chair or the kitchen counter to shop online for holiday gifts this year. That’s up from 65% who said so last year.Wednesday’s session wasn’t much to write home about, though it’s worth noting that some of the “stay at home” stocks in the Tech sector, including semiconductors, got a boost after playing second fiddle to Financials, Energy, and Industrials earlier in the week. One big Tech winner was Slack (WORK), whose shares jumped about 37% after The Wall Street Journal reported that the workplace messaging platform is in acquisition talks with Salesforce CRM +0.3% (CRM).The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) couldn’t keep its head above 30,000 Wednesday after getting there for the first time on Tuesday, but that stands to reason. You often see consolidation after a big milestone is hit. Anyway, the $DJI isn’t the market. It’s only 30 stocks. While it’s come a long way since the pandemic lows, it hasn’t done as well as the S&P 500 Index (SPX), or Nasdaq NDAQ -0.2% (COMP), for that matter.Also, the Russell 2000 Index (RUT) of small caps has been outrunning almost everyone else the last month or two, though it took a breather Wednesday. Don’t discount the impact of a thriving housing sector on the RUT. When housing is strong, it can increase business for the regional banks that make up a good chunk of that index.While the major indices gallop, the dollar continues to edge lower. The U. S. Dollar Index ($DXY)—which measures the greenback vs. a basket of other currencies—slipped below 92 on Wednesday for the first time since early September. Wednesday’s dollar weakness came after weekly initial jobless claims ticked above Wall Street’s expectations for the second time in a row. A flagging dollar can sometimes be helpful for equity bulls and might signal growing enthusiasm about overseas economies returning to life next year, but also speaks to concerns about U.S. economic softness. Some analysts now expect U.S. growth to go negative in Q1.Those lower Q1 estimates are despite the Atlanta Fed’s GDP Now meter predicting 11% seasonally-adjusted annual growth for Q4. That’s up from its previous estimate of 5.6%. We’re still a long way from getting Q1 estimates from the Fed, but investors can expect some longer-term growth outlooks, perhaps, at the Fed’s mid-December meeting.That’s well in the future, so let’s look at what faces investors next week. Nothing stands out as much as next Friday’s monthly payrolls report, and more eyes are focused on it after these last two weeks of rising jobless claims that suggest the recovery has slowed. October saw 638,000 new jobs created, but the headline figure is down several months in a row, and some analysts are even wondering if eventually it could go negative.Other key reports next week include Chicago PMI and monthly ISM manufacturing. The ISM could be interesting, considering how strong it was in October. Any sign of a pullback might raise concerns that lack of government stimulus and rising virus cases have started a negative blowback. Weakness there might get reflected in some of the same cyclical sectors that helped lead the recent rally. We’re talking Industrials, Materials, and Energy.Besides the Fed meeting, December could feature vaccine approvals and the start of distribution if all goes well. Anyone looking for a catalyst might want to monitor that situation closely. The last three Mondays featured positive vaccine news lifting the market. While that may just be coincidence, keep an eye on stock futures Sunday night for possible clues about whether a fourth winning Monday in a row could be in the cards.We’re still awaiting some virus data from other companies, and of course any action from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Regulators there plan to take about three weeks to review Pfizer’s PFE +1.9% (PFE) vaccine before an outside panel of experts meets to review the application the second week of December. That meeting has been scheduled for Dec. 10, The New York Times NYT +0.7% reported this week.Also keep an eye out next week for OPEC, which at its meeting is expected to keep current production cuts unchanged. Crude zoomed up to eight-month highs earlier this week above $45 a barrel, and that’s helped spark the Energy sector. Still, there’s a sense that things may have come too far, too fast, considering relatively soft U.S. economic data recently. It’s unclear if demand is really here, or if investors are just getting excited about chances for improved demand, say, six months from now when things are hopefully more normal.CHART OF THE DAY: OVERLOOKED AGAIN. The headlines all went to the Dow Jones Industrial Average ... [+]“Fed Put” Has New Competition: You already know the stock market can go down as well as up, despite the way things might seem lately. However, recent down moves have frequently run into a “buy the dip” mentality. That could be in part because the major indices enjoy a “vaccine put”—kind of like the “Fed put” they already had, some analysts argue. The “Fed put” is an expression that grew popular when the Fed kept rates near zero for years to allow the economy to recover from the Great Recession. Investors then (and in some cases today) felt reassured that if something bad happened, the Fed would have the market’s back. Now if something bad happens, there’s hope that a vaccine or two on the near horizon could keep a nice net under the market, as well. This, along with hopes for continued positive headlines on vaccines and a general sense that the economy can do better in 2021, could be driving some of the pre-holiday optimism.Like No Holiday Season Ever: With today being Black Friday, normally the TV networks would show people lining up to be first into stores. Maybe some shoppers are heading to big boxes as they usually do, but it’s likely more are staying home and ordering. Others may be “drive-by” shopping and picking up their orders in their cars. With more of this untraditional shopping expected as the holidays continue, retailers face logistical challenges to get everything packed and delivered, one retail executive told CNBC Wednesday. Some of this could end up reflected in holiday-quarter bottom lines when Q4 earnings start filtering in two months from now.No doubt expenses have risen for the sector due to Covid-19. We’ve already seen Amazon AMZN +0.3% (AMZN) announce the hiring of 100,000 seasonal employees to help with what’s expected to be unprecedented online holiday demand. Other companies have made major supply chain investments to deal with increasing e-commerce sales and deliveries. There are also expenses for protecting more workers from the virus, as Home Depot HD +0.7% (HD) outlined in its recent earnings call, and higher wages some companies, including HD, are paying employees. While shares of some retailers fell despite strong Q3 earnings as investors worried whether the sales pace was sustainable and concerned about costs, you could argue that in the long run, Covid-19 sped up a lot of changes that were already in process before the pandemic. This could ultimately benefit retailers who invested smartly.Gate Check: There’ve been just four days since March when more than a million Americans passed through airports, according to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Three of them were in the last week, while four other recent days saw more than 900,000 but fewer than one million passengers travel by plane. Despite government calls on people to stay home, Thanksgiving travel has been going on—though the pace is less than half of last year’s. This could explain why some of the airline stocks got a lift earlier this week, along with strength for Boeing BA -0.5% (BA) shares, which are sometimes viewed as an overall barometer for the air travel sector. It might also explain the recent strength in crude, which rose to its highest levels since March on Tuesday. All that said, many airlines had been hoping that air travel would fall only about 50% from a year ago, and instead it’s down more than 60%. There’s still the Christmas travel season to consider, so we’ll see if things pick up further.TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

""Allowing a near-monopolist to eliminate a maverick competitor poses obvious risks of harm,” one former DOJ lawyer told Politico. TurboTax, which offers a free option for only the most basic tax returns and tiered pricing for commonly needed services, enjoys a more-than two-thirds share of the online market for tax preparation, but since its debut four years ago, Credit Karma Tax helped lure customers away with its always-free services, becoming the fifth-largest digital do-it-yourself tax preparer. The DOJ officially stepped in to review the acquisition in August after senators urged it to do so. 41 million. That\'s approximately how many people filed individual federal tax returns this year using TurboTax, the largest player in the space by far. By comparison, Credit Karma Tax had 2 million filers.

Global markets were also calmer following Wall Street's record Tuesday session: The United Kingdom's FTSE 100 shed 0.6%, Germany's DAX fell 0.2%, and Japan's Nikkei 25 ended the day up 0.5%.“The major indices are sitting on huge gains for the month of November, and while the vaccine developments are terrific—and will lead to the end of the pandemic—the next few months promise to be trying as cases continue to spike,” Crisafulli said Wednesday, adding that vaccination prospects are likely cause for a smaller stimulus package. “The vaccine data is worth a few trillion in stimulus, so how the fiscal process unfolds in Washington is of less importance than was the case back in October.”Boosted by a strong rebound in corporate profits, real gross domestic product increased at an annualized rate of 33.1% in the third quarter, according to a new estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Wednesday, after tumbling 31.4% in the second quarter.Tesla surpassed a $500 billion market capitalization on Tuesday, and shares are now up more than 10% in the past week alone following S&P Global’s announcement last Monday that it’s adding the electric carmaker to its storied S&P 500 index in December. Elon Musk is now worth an estimated $126 billion. Markets are closed on Thursday and open only for a half-day on Friday, but Wednesday afternoon will deliver the Federal Reserve’s FOMC minutes, which should shed light on how the Fed views the economic recovery (or lack thereof).Unemployment Claims Are Rising Again Amid Covid-19 Surge (Forbes)Dow Soars 450 Points To New High As Formal Biden Transition Begins, But The Market’s Flashing A Few Warning Signs (Forbes)Dow Jones Industrial Average Hits Record 30,000–Reaching A Historic Milestone As 11 Million Americans Remain Unemployed Amid Pandemic (Forbes)1.3 Million More Americans Could Lose Their Jobs As Daily Covid Cases Skyrocket, But A Double-Dip Recession Is Unlikely, Says Moody’s (Forbes)I'm a reporter at Forbes focusing on markets and finance.

Barring a bazooka stimulus in the U.S. and Europe that is designed to keep small businesses alive and laid off workers financially sound, it is hard not to view China as the winner in the pandemic.As most of the Western World has taken to rumors of lockdowns, deaths, and even greater panic attacks to come, China — whose citizens are already under the control of its government — is able to itself to Wall Street as the place to be.About two weeks ago, Ray Dalio said that if the U.S. and Europe are going to be cowering for the next six months until there’s a cure or 60% of their populations are vaccinated with a new drug, then capital is just going to flow where there’s growth and some semblance of predictability. And that’s China.“It’s called state capitalism, but they’ll produce more billionaires than the U.S.,” Dalio said. “I think capitalism and the development of the capital markets could, in a few years, be more embraced in China than they are in the U.S.”In other words, top down management of the economy by unelected officials steering money towards favorite sectors — in China’s case, semiconductors, all forms of green tech, and pharmaceuticals — and protectionism.A rainy November day in Shanghai.

Nomura is sticking with their GDP growth forecast of 5.7% in China for this quarter, up from 4.9% in the third.Shanghai, which has gone almost completely unscathed by the SARS 2 pandemic so far, is reportedly testing millions of people and closing schools, the AP reported last week. The South China Morning Post and Shanghai Daily have no reports of any lockdown restrictions taking place as of Friday. Currently, 62 people in a city of 24 million are hospitalized with the SARS 2 coronavirus, according to the Chinese government.Whether those numbers are true or not, Nomura thinks their economy is realistically sailing forward on an even keel and will be doing so in the months ahead.“We firmly believe Beijing will maintain its policy stance,” Lu said about monetary policy and — like Dalio highlighted — its state directed capital as outlined in its most recent Five Year Plan.The X-Trackers China CSI-300 ETF, best known by its ticker “ASHR”, is up 1.4% on Friday, beating the S&P 500, which is up 0.4%.Bye-bye, Nasdaq.

While most of this will be geared towards sales in the mainland (China is the world’s leading car market, and No. 1 EV manufacturer), it is not far-fetched to imagine those Tesla batteries being shipped to Europe, or to the United States as demand far exceeds supply here.Tesla, along with Japan’s Panasonic and South Korea’s LG Chem are the world’s leading producers of long-life battery cells for electronic vehicles. China’s BYD and CATL are considered second tier producers. While they make more batteries, their battery technology is not yet as good as their competitors. Surely the Chinese engineers working at Tesla in Shanghai will eventually get up to speed and learn the ropes. Then they will move to BYD and CATL.Meanwhile, the 7,000 Teslas that arrived in the EU yesterday will be shipped to Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Switzerland. Germany’s EV future will be made in China. France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Switzerland are marginal auto makers at this point, by comparison.Tao Lin, vice president at Tesla, told Xinhua that Tesla gained more confidence in China after getting through the pandemic and is now benefitting from the economic recovery.Nomura Securities said in a note to clients today that it expects over 5.3% GDP growth in the fourth quarter, following a 4%+ growth rate in the third quarter.Xi Jinping said China will grow at 5% in 2021.Tao said the export of China-made Tesla Model 3’s will expand.

Ask Larry about Social Security here.When I File For Social Security Retirement Benefits, Will I Lose My Spousal Benefits?Hi Larry, I'm age 66 and collecting spousal benefits. I haven't filed for my Social Security retirement benefits yet. I am not retired but I have lost my job because of the pandemic. I plan to sign up for retirement when I'm 70. When I retire will I lose my spousal benefits? Thanks, AnnaHi Anna, Only people born prior to 1/2/1954 are allowed to apply for spousal benefits without also being required to file for their own retirement benefits at the same time. And they can only do so if they file for spousal benefits at full retirement age (FRA) or later.If you're just drawing spousal benefits and if you eventually apply for your retirement benefits, you can only be paid the higher of the two rates. By the way, that would be true even if you were receiving survivor benefits instead of spousal benefits. If your retirement benefit rate is higher, your spousal benefits will be terminated when you start drawing your retirement benefits. If your retirement benefit isn't higher, then there's probably no reason you'd want to apply for your own benefits. If you did though, you'd be paid your own rate plus a partial spousal benefit rate that would add up to your higher spousal rate. The two benefits would then be combined into one payment.You may want to consider using my company's software — Maximize My Social Security or MaxiFi Planner — to fully analyze the options available to you in order to determine your best strategy for maximizing benefits.

Best, LarryIf I Collect Divorced Spousal Benefits At 62, Will It Affect My Retirement Benefits When I Turn 70?Hi Larry, My ex is 71 and I am 60. We were married 13 years. I have never remarried again. If I collect spousal benefits based on his earnings record at 62 till I turn 70, would it affect my retirement benefits when I turn 70? Thanks, JosephHi Joseph, Since you were born after 1/1/1954, you could never file for divorced spousal benefits on a living ex's record without also being required to file for your own retirement benefits at the same time. So to be clear, as long as your ex is still living, there is no way that you could file just for divorced spousal benefits and allow your own retirement benefit rate to keep growing.Only people born prior to 1/2/1954 are allowed to file for spousal or divorced benefits while their spouse or ex-spouse is living without also being required to file for their own benefits at the same time. So if you file for benefits at 62, you'll only qualify for essentially the higher of your own benefit rate or your divorced spousal rate, and your benefit amount will be reduced for age. Best, LarryWhen A Spouse Dies, Where Does The Remaining Money Go If It's Not Used Up?Hi Larry, what happens to the money they paid in Social Security taxes if a spouse dies? Does it get allocated to the survivors? If not, why doesn't it? Thanks, CharlesHi Charles, Social Security is an insurance program designed to help replace income lost due to death, disability or old age. It is not an individual retirement account that can be passed on to heirs. Any taxes that a person pays remain in the Social Security trust fund unless and until either that person or their eligible dependents or survivors meet the requirements for entitlement to Social Security benefits.As it true with most insurance programs, there is no guarantee that you or any any of your relatives will ever be able to collect benefits based on your contributions to the program.

(Photo by ... [+]Who will be the biggest winner among air carriers, once the virus is a bad memory? A good bet is Southwest LUV -1.1% Airlines. Here’s a value play that is well-suited to pay off. Now changing hands at $48 per share, it could well retrace its path to its 2017 peak of $65.Overall, it’s hard to find anyone on Wall Street who thinks that airlines will be goners, post-pandemic. After their trough in May, the major carriers have seen their stocks surge back, in most cases doubling. Southwest’s shares are 92% higher since then, and is just 11% below the carrier’s year-end 2019 level.Sure, airline finances remain deeply in the red. And domestic flights are still way down, the temporary Thanksgiving holiday surge notwithstanding. According to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, through September, their volume has slipped 36% from the year before, which does show an improvement on 70% down in June. Southwest, which has pared its flights by a third, sank into unprofitability this year, suffering three straight quarters of losses, which total $2.6 billion.But Southwest is strategically and financially better off than its peers, suggesting that it will be the stock to buy and own going forward. Time was that investing in airlines was folly because they always swung from boom to bust. In recent years, however, with their add-on charges and better capacity utilization, they were doing pretty well until the virus made flying an iffy experience.Burkett Huey, a Morningstar MORN +0.8% analyst, noted that Southwest “is optimistic that the nascent recovery in passenger traffic will last until a COVID-19 vaccine allows for a much more robust recovery.” Encouragingly, Southwest has been a better investment than its competitors, according to Morningstar data. Looking at five-year annualized total equity returns—admittedly, these are skewed by the 2020 red-ink torrent—Southwest has enjoyed the best performance, up 2%. The others are negative: American Airline Group AAL +0.3%, down 17%; United Airlines Holdings UAL -0.7%, with 4.1% lost; and Delta Air Lines DAL -0.6%, minus 0.2%.Southwest is adding four new destinations this year, including Miami and Colorado’s ski area. Next year, it will push into six new cities, notably Chicago’s O’Hare, long dominated by United. The company made similar lucrative expansions after 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis. Another plus: In December, Southwest will book the middle seat on its planes, which should increase revenue.The fourth largest U.S. airline, Southwest had prospered before the pandemic as a discount carrier, focusing on leisure travel, instead of the now-woebegone business sector. Low-cost airlines like Southwest have managed costs better than the larger ones, Huey wrote in a report, because they use a single aircraft type (the Boeing 757 in Southwest’s case), favor less popular airports that have lower fees, and abjure expensive hub-and-spoke networks, preferring to fly direct to destinations.What’s more Southwest has just a few routes abroad, and those are in the Western Hemisphere. Extensive international routes have been an additional burden for competitors during the pandemic. Smal wonder that, in the recent quarter, Southwest became the No. 2 domestic carrier by traffic. (American Airlines is top-ranked in the U.S.)Best of all, Southwest boasts the strongest balance sheet in the industry, which puts it in better stead than the other majors. And leaves it most able to live without more federal aid: The $25 billion airline bailout ended Sept. 30. Southwest bonds have the only investment grade in the industry. The company’s total debt is just $12.6 billion. That’s roughly a third of what American, Delta and United carry on their books. Only Delta has more cash on hand, $21.5 billion to Southwest’s $14.5 billion.As a Morgan Stanley MS +0.6% report described Southwest, “the market still does not adequately appreciate the quality of the franchise.” As a result, the firm went on, this “makes the stock very attractive at the current price.”Good investing ideas, often contrarian, constitute my brief, here at Forbes.com.

59,['https://www.forbes.com/sites/leonlabrecque/2020/11/27/ppp-forgiveness-apply-now-or-wait/'],['PPP Forgiveness: Apply Now Or Wait?'],"['When, and how, to apply for PPP Loan forgiveness.The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was a huge component of the CARES stimulus package aimed at helping smaller businesses and non-profits stay afloat in the beginning of the pandemic. The program was fraught with administrative changes and nuances, but nonetheless 5.2 million loans were granted for a total of about $525 Billion dollars. The PPP was intended to provide support for payroll and the SBA reported that the PPP positively impacted 51 million jobs. A big question is: When do I apply for forgiveness? Now, like my bank wants me to, or later?The most immediate issue facing you as a PPP borrower, is assuring your loan is forgivable. For most applicants, their PPP loan was calculated using 2½ months of their 2019 payroll or self-employment income. Originally, PPP loan proceeds had to be spent within 8 weeks of receiving the loan. That period was extended to 24 weeks. If you received a PPP loan for $350,000 in March, had forgivable expenses of the same amount within the 24-week period, and met the other rules (there are always “other rules”), the entire loan is forgiven. Forgivable expenses are payroll (with pay caps on owners, highly compensated staff and certain fringe benefits) plus rent, utilities and mortgage interest.The forgiven amount is tax-free. However, the IRS has ruled that the expenses paid with forgiven PPP loan proceeds are not deductible. So, if your company got a $350,000 PPP loan and used it to cover part of your payroll, $350,000 of your 2020 payroll expense would not be deductible. The IRS just ruled that PPP funded expenses are not deductible no matter when your PPP loan is forgiven (now or in 2021). There is a possibility that pending legislation would allow PPP-paid expenses to be deductible while keeping the forgiveness as tax-free; however, that’s only a possibility and it’s generally not prudent to base your tax planning on “possibilities.”You must apply for forgiveness within 10 months after the end of the ‘Covered Period.’ which is the 24-week period that starts when you received your PPP loan. The lender (i.e. your bank) has 2 months to process your loan forgiveness application then SBA has three additional months to approve your forgiveness. Here are some additional nuances you need to be aware of:‘Quickie’ Forgiveness Form (3508S). If your PPP loan was $50,000 or less and you used all of the funds for payroll and other forgivable expenses, you can use a form 3508S. It’s a one-page form where you affirm that you used the loan for qualified expenses. You don’t submit any expense documentation with the application but agree to keep all of your documentation for 6 years. It doesn’t get much easier than this. Don’t qualify to use the 3508S? There is a “Plan B” that might simplify your forgiveness process.EZ Form (3508EZ). As the name suggests, form 3508EZ is rather ‘easy’ to file. (Of course, your idea of ‘easy’ may not coincide with the perceptions of the IRS and SBA.) If you can satisfy at least one of the following three requirements, use form 3508EZ. This form eliminates the need to submit your employee headcount and payroll reduction documentation; however, you will need to document that you spent your PPP funds for qualified payroll and non-payroll (e.g. rent, utilities, mortgage interest) expenses.1.     You are self-employed and have no employees2.     You did not reduce the salaries or wages of your employees by more than 25 percent and did not reduce the number or hours of your employees from January 1st through the end of your Covered Period. (Remember, your “Covered Period” is the 24-week period from the date you received your PPP loan proceeds.), or,3.     You experienced reduced headcount as a result of complying with CDC, HHS or OSHA health directives related to COVID-19 and did not reduce the salaries or wages of your employees by more than 25 percent.The Main Forgiveness Application. If you don’t fit the mold of the 3508S (loan $50,000 or under) or the 3508EZ, you must file form 3508 and supply the headcount calculations and documentation that your funds were spent on qualified payroll and non-payroll expenses. If you chose to use a 24-week Covered Period, your qualified payroll cost will probably exceed your loan amount, so you’ll only need to submit payroll records - greatly simplifying the documentation process.Over $2 million? Prove It: At the outset, certain large PPP loans generated controversy regarding their necessity. To address this valid concern, the Treasury announced all loans over $2 million will be subject to full audits. In early November, the SBA published a ‘necessity questionnaire.’ The questionnaire is rigorous in determining the necessity of a PPP loan. If a borrower fails this test, its loan will not be forgiven. There are two versions of the questionnaire, one for for-profit entities and another for nonprofit organizations.When to apply, now or later? Now we get to the big question: When should you apply for forgiveness? There are two schools of thought: apply now while we know the rules and before things could change for the worse; or delay application until after the year-end and see what might come out in subsequent leadership or stimulus bills. To get a handle on this, I did an informal poll of CPA firms in Michigan (I’m a task force leader at the Michigan Association of CPAs). My poll asked if they were advising their clients to apply now or wait. I solicited input from professionals working in a wide range of firms, from the largest in the state to sole practitioners. I also asked for commentary. Here are the results:·       Under $50,000 (for-profit and nonprofit) with no staff or payroll reductions - apply now (pretty much unanimous by comment)·       Self-employed with no employees - apply now·       For-profit entities that must file form 3508 - 85% of respondents said ‘wait’ and 15% said ‘apply now’·       Commentary on loans over $2 million was to carefully review the questionnaire and maybe even consider repaymentI’ll throw in my 2 cents; I’d vote to wait. You have 10 months from the end of your Covered Period, which gives most of us until sometime in August of 2021 to apply. By then, we may have another stimulus bill that may allow for the deductibility of PPP-funded expenses (the possible HEROES act). In addition, they (Congress) may increase the automatic forgiveness amount to $150,000 (chatter from DC).Bottom line: If you are a nonprofit with a PPP loan under $2 million and have enough evidence of forgiveness, apply now. If you have a PPP under $50,000, and used it for payroll, apply now. If you are self-employed and have no employees and got the PPP, apply now. For the rest of the PPP recipients, most CPAs I surveyed think waiting is better than rushing.As always, I’ll try to respond to questions.

[+]Wall Street reacted positively to President-elect Joe Biden’s nomination of Janet Yellen for Treasury secretary. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a record high of more than 30,000 points, and the S&P 500 came close to one.But Yellen’s abundance of experience — particularly as head of the Federal Reserve during the previous recession recovery — isn’t just a plus for business and financial markets. State and local governments have reason to be optimistic as well.Yellen and the Biden administration are expected to support the idea of aid for state and local governments, which are dealing with billions of dollars in lost revenue from the Covid-19 recession. Tom Kozlik, head of municipal strategy & credit at Hilltop Securities, says he expects Yellen to be “a very active Treasury secretary and leader in Washington,” similar to former Secretary Hank Paulson, who helped shepherd reform legislation during the 2008 financial crisis.But with the possibility of a divided Congress, what exactly will that push for aid look like? If Republicans retain control of the U.S. Senate, it’s extremely unlikely the House Democrats will get the full host of aid they wanted, which included $375 billion in direct aid to state and local governments.The Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum’s Mark Sobel says, “Yellen will help negotiate and provide intellectual backing, making the case that now is the time to spend.” And, he adds, “with low debt service costs, America should not fret in the near-term about rising debt.”But other than being part of a more favorable administration for state and local budget aid during a recession, Yellen can have a more direct impact. This month, current Secretary Steven Mnuchin unexpectedly announced he was ending a Federal Reserve emergency lending program for state and local governments.Sobel notes that, after “Mnuchin’s uncooperative action unwinding Treasury’s existing support” for Fed facilities (including several emergency lending programs), Yellen is likely to take the opposite tack and work in partnership with the Fed.Although the state and local emergency loan programs have not yet been used widely by governments, that’s largely because the stimulus passed earlier this year by Congress has helped their budgets to some extent. But aid from the CARES Act will end on Dec. 30. So, the existence of a loan program is a kind of insurance that help will be there when it’s needed.I am a fiscal policy expert, national journalist and public speaker who has spent more than 15 years writing about the many ways state and local governments collect and']",['354 views'],['Taxes'],['https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizfarmer/2020/11/25/why-yellens-nomination-is-good-news-for-financially-ailing-governments/']

This is to the extent where some are seeing substance abuse as a “pandemic within a pandemic”. Filling the gap in available treatment is a policy issue that has to be addressed by society, but trusts can be drafted so as to increase the likelihood of long term (2+ years) recovery from less than 25% to 92%.            Although most trusts have asset protection provisions, the so called “spend-thrift clause,” trusts must go beyond preventing the beneficiary’s creditors from reaching the assets. The Trustee must be authorized, by the term of the trust, to use financial leverage early, maintain that pressure for many months, find and use qualified experts and provide  a support even when some financial benefits are cut. This includes paying for housing, support for the spouse and children, and paying for private therapy. The Trustee must be free to require that the beneficiary agrees to open communication, including drug testing, medical information releases, meetings and other required conduct in their recovery plan. This way, beneficiaries are never completely cut off, but they recognize that harmful behavior has immediate and significant effects.           I would like to assure my clients that they will never have a beneficiary who has a substance abuse problem. Statistically, however, it is likely that, sooner or later, a present or future beneficiary of a trust will fall victim to this disease and will need three things: family support, access to expertise, and accountability for their behavior. Trusts need to be drafted in such a way that a Trustee can provide that accountability through leveraging access to the financial benefits. Consider it as insurance, you may never need it, but if it’s needed, it could save someone’s life.

After all, we’ve heard time and time again that the Fed will do whatever it takes to support the bond market through the crisis. Now a big source of cash needed to do that is gone.The bond market’s response was even more surprising: crickets.The junk bond–tracking SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF (JNK) JNK +0.1% and iShares National Muni Bond ETF (MUB) held on to post-election gains after Mnuchin’s decision was announced.If you think this is an opportunity to sell, I’d ask you to reconsider. While markets get things wrong all the time, in this instance they’re right not to worry; the programs that guaranteed debts went almost entirely untouched. A $750-billion program for this purpose, for instance, has used just $13.5 billion, mostly because just the knowledge the program was there kept panic selling at bay.Today, investors understand that these programs were barely needed, even in the spring lockdown. And since we’re unlikely to see a national lockdown in this second wave of COVID-19, these programs aren’t as necessary as you’d think. Even in the unlikely event we do see a lockdown, it’s fairly safe to assume that since the programs weren’t needed last time, they won’t be needed this time.But that hasn’t stopped some spooked investors from jumping the gun. That, in turn, has set up some bargains for us in closed-end funds (CEFs).The Big Yield StealConsider, for example, the Western Asset High Income Opportunities Fund (HIO). Right now, HIO trades at a 9.6% discount to NAV, more than its long-term average discount of 7.2%, partly due to overreaction to the Mnuchin headline. What’s more, HIO has crushed corporate-bond index funds like JNK since its IPO.And, finally, HIO is an income machine, offering a 7.9% yield, thanks to its diversified high-yield bond portfolio and large discount. As you can see above, HIO holders have doubled their investment in a decade.

[+]Abu Dhabi this week announced its discovery of 22 billion barrels of oil reserves. This could be the biggest oil find in decades, and has already stirred rumors that Abu Dhabi might be thinking about quitting OPEC — the better to set its own oil export policies.Not so fast: most of the emirate’s new oil (20 billion barrels) was “unconventional,” specifically shale oil, which would require more effort to extract from beneath the sands than their existing conventional oil production. The remaining 2 billion barrels of new oil, which ADNOC described as “an increase in conventional oil reserves” presumably represents an upward revision of existing reserves rather than an actual discovery of new fields, as many media reports imply. Upward revisions of reserves is common in the industry reflecting a variety of effects from enhanced recovery like gas or water injection to additional infill drilling or simply new analysis of existing data. It was much scoffed at by peak oil theorists like Colin Campbell and Jean Laherrere, who long argued that reserve growth was only a U.S. phenomenon and reflected SEC reporting requirements. (Which argument was complicated by their insistence that reserve revisions should be backdated to year of the field’s initial discovery, something necessitated by an occurrence they insisted was not real.)And 20 billion barrels of shale oil is nice to have (it’s more than the Lynch family holdings by a factor of, well, let’s just say 100 million or so), but exploitation of it is probably very distant. Conventional wells in Abu Dhabi produce an average of about 2,000 barrels a day, more than the initial production levels of most shale wells, and conventional wells decline at 5-10% per year, versus 30-60% for shale oil wells. So, in the first ten years of operation, a conventional well will easily produce 2.5 times as much oil as even the best shale well, and generally cost ¼ or less as much as shale well.It’s also worth noting that the Emirates (mostly Abu Dhabi) already had a huge untapped oil resource, specifically about 100 billion barrels of conventional petroleum, of which approximately 1.5% is produced each year (pre-pandemic). That’s a reserve to production ratio of about 70, compared to the U.S.’s 11, meaning they could increase production significantly without more discoveries. And the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company does indeed have plans to add another 1 mb/d of capacity by 2030, although such long-term plans are often changed in response to market conditions.The rumors that the Emirates might drop out of OPEC might be a trial balloon or just a negotiating strategy, as the country has produced about 30 million barrels more than allowed under this spring’s production agreement and is under pressure to reduce production now by a corresponding amount. Needless to say, they are reluctant to do so, but leaving OPEC would be a very large step, especially in current times.Oil exporters have suffered greatly during the pandemic (and the glut which preceded it) and a breakdown of unity would almost certainly cause other countries in OPEC+ to raise production, trigging a new price collapse. Sub-$30 oil would not be out of the question, particularly if the Saudis joined in the clash by raising production. To date, the Saudis have rigorously followed their quota (and even cut more at times) but undoubtedly would react to a breakdown of cohesion by, at the least, standing aside and letting prices fall.The Emirates’ officials know this and while a departure from OPEC might have been bruited about behind closed doors, the probability that it will go beyond rumor seems small. The organization (and its predecessors) has been successful because of the very obvious benefits that cooperation brings to its members, and that is very unlikely to change.I am a Distinguished Fellow at the Energy Policy Research Foundation and President of Strategic Energy and Economic Research.

[+]When he ran for president in 2004 John Kerry was mocked by opponents for his ability to speak French, with ‘Monsieur Kerry”, “Jean Chéri”, or “Jean-François Kerry” amongst the favourite catcalls of Republicans. Imagine the fun they will have with the new Biden administration – not only Kerry speaks French, but Anthony Blinken was educated in France and Michele Flournoy is a Francophile too.French saved AmericaMike Pompeo has conjured up images of highly educated, high minded members of the Biden cabinet jaunting around European capitals debating the finer points of diplomacy with Europeans, while Marco Rubio – who has found his voice given Donald Trump is on the way out of the White House – paints the Biden team as elegantly presiding over American decline. It’s an interesting image of Biden’s team – effete, be-wigged and decked in frock coats, conversing in French. But then, so did Beaumarchais and Lafayette and they saved America.The ‘French speaking men and women in frock coats’ are a key part of Joe Biden’s Restoration. They will restore order, harmony and morale to institutions like the State Department, and I would not be surprised to see a senior diplomat be given the specific role of rebuilding it from the inside out.However, if the Biden team, many of whom worked in the Obama administration, think they will find the world as they left it four years ago with America effortlessly slipping into the top seat in world affairs, they are mistaken. China has grown much more powerful and assertive (note the way it treats Australia), Turkey is an engine of geopolitical chaos (as we noted last week), and even Europe is striking out on its own path. What’s worse is that like half of the American population, the rest of the world worries that Trump (or someone like him) might be back in four years’ time.This should impart some urgency to the Biden team. Integrating climate problems into foreign policy is a welcome start, as there is common ground with both China and the EU here, but given the need to restart economies, it is hard to envisage what meaningful measures can be introduced to curb climate damage in the near term.Janet Yellen in chargeThe bringing together of climate policy with foreign affairs is a sign of things to come, specifically that many issues will intersect. For instance, a key part of Janet Yellen’s role will be the international diplomacy associated with the Treasury, and in particular trying to align economic policies in Europe, America and parts of Asia so that they all move in the same direction.  A much bigger challenge is the integration of indebtedness into the strategic rivalry between the US, China and Europe. Each region, in different ways, has run up record levels of debt such that the sum total of world debt (per GDP) is pushing levels not seen since the Napoleonic Wars. The Chancellor of the Exchequer’s spending review last week underlined this. If we accept that overindebtedness can act like a financial handbrake then, whichever region can most quickly reduce its debt burden will have a head start in the strategic race to lead the 21st century.NapoleonThe lesson for Blinken and colleagues is that balance sheets rather than space wars are the most important tools in the diplomatic contest. They should study the role the Bank of England played during and after the Napoleonic Wars and the financial reforms that were made in the UK in the early nineteenth century that contributed to Britain’s rise as a world power.One implication as far as the economic debate in the Democratic party is concerned is that there may soon be a sharp divide between foreign policy aware policymakers who wish to curb debt issuance (and keep a steady dollar), versus those (MMT – Modern Monetary Theorists amongst them) who believe that the USA can and should issue debt ad nauseum.The same focus on the mixture of finance and diplomacy is relevant with respect to American policy towards Russia, a subject where nearly all the Biden team are united in their distrust of the Putin administration. I suspect that policy towards Russia will initially at least, focus on money flows (Catherine Belton’s book ‘Putin’s People’ is very good on this).Even if American foreign policy becomes more foreign policy driven, I do not expect a mothballing of expensive fighter jets and aircraft carriers, not least as there are some conflicts internationally where America may re-engage.Pacifist?In general, I have Africa in mind and specifically Ethiopia, which like many other countries is falling into the investment orbit of China. The contentious lesson from the Obama era is that a lack of aggressive action by the United States across the world has opened up theatres like Africa to Russia (now building a naval base in Sudan) and China. To that end American foreign policy may take on a more activist stance and, historians will look back on Donald trump as the ‘Pacifist President’.Follow me on @levellingbookI am the author of a book called The Levelling which points to what's next after globalization and puts forward constructive ideas as to how an increasingly fractured""]","['2,531 views']",['Hedge Funds & Private Equity'],['https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeosullivan/2020/11/27/debt-will-determine-how-america-engages-with-the-rest-of-the-world/']

Photo by Andrej Sokolow/picture ... [+]The world of technology moves fast, as Lux Research’s annual list of the top technologies to watch over the next decades proves.After a tumultuous 2020, 10 of last year’s 20 technologies don’t appear on this year’s list, showing how dynamic changes in the innovation landscape have been over the past year. Notably, 5G networks, the top-ranked technology in last year’s report, are absent from this year’s list because, as the 5G rollout begins, they are now firmly established on everyone’s radar.The new report, Foresight 2021: Top Emerging Technologies to Watch, identifies and ranks 12 key technologies that will reshape the world. The top three technologies cited in the report are:Autonomous vehicles: All levels of vehicle automation are seeing improvements in safety and efficiency, benefiting both consumers and commercial operations. Level 4 and 5 autonomous vehicles will transform mobility and logistics by removing the need for a driver behind the wheel of a vehicle.This will create opportunities in areas like sensors, high-definition mapping and connectivity for autonomous vehicles but it will also have a significant impact on mobility businesses more broadly, with many drivers being replaced in areas from ride-hailing services to trucking.Natural language processing: Powering devices like voice assistants, machine translation, and chatbots, natural language processing (NLP) patents have grown by 44% CAGR over the past five years, to more than 3,000 publications annually.Plastic recycling: Concern about plastic waste is nothing new, but major consumer product brands have committed to increasing recycling rates and innovations that can convert waste into higher-value products. Over the past decade alone, 155 startups addressing plastic waste have been founded. Extended producer responsibility (EPR) rules mean that materials collection must increasingly be validated, leading to a need for advances in tracking and sortingThis will create opportunities in areas such as waste collection and for companies that can use plastic waste as a feedstock. Innovations such as designing for recyclability and techniques to convert plastic waste into valuable products, enabling a circular economy and avoiding pollution, are likely to emerge in coming years.Unsurprisingly, a number of technologies aimed at fighting the Covid-19 pandemic have also made the list. “Technologies from our lists like digital biomarkers and AI-enabled sensors can help bring businesses back to work,” explains Michael Holman, vice-president of research and lead author of the report. “But for all the changes that the pandemic has brought, the key megatrends shaping the future are still in force. Technologies that support these transitions, such as autonomous vehicles, alternative proteins, and green hydrogen, will maintain their momentum as a result.”A technology new to the Lux leader board is AI-enabled sensors, which are enabling developers and operators to extract more value out of sensors, create new products and improve internal processes by generating deeper insights off existing hardware. Sensors of all kinds now can provide more impactful insights when coupled with machine learning and AI, across a huge range of industries. They also form a powerful combination when coupled with automation technologies such as 3D printing and robotics. More than $1.8bn has been raised by companies developing or using AI-enabled sensors.Along with autonomous technology, they are helping to automate the workplace, and enhance the capabilities of workers that remain.Green hydrogen, which is produced using water and renewable electricity, is another key technology – less in the much-hyped field of hydrogen vehicles and more in helping to clean up otherwise hard-to-decarbonize industrial processes in industries such as steel and cement. It will also play a key role in energy storage to increase the use of renewable technologies. Hydrogen can be the basis for making chemicals from electricity and CO2, as a path to distributed manufacturing, in a process known as power-to-chemicals.One of the key trends of 2020, aside from the pandemic, has been the growth of alternative proteins, driven by concerns about climate change, animal welfare and population growth. Companies such as Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat are showing that there is a massive opportunity to cater to sustainability-minded consumers and to the demand for protein choice in general.Animal meat is known for its resource-intensive nature; alternative proteins provide a pathway to similar but sustainable food experiences. Beyond Meat’s shares rose by 112% between the start of the year and the end of August, despite the coronavirus slowdown.Of the technologies on last year’s list that don’t make this year’s list, some are still represented through other categories, such as last-mile delivery, which is still represented through options like autonomous vehicles and enablers like AI sensors.Others have not yet created sufficient use cases, such as blockchain, or the economics remain unfavorable, such as vertical farming.Battery fast charging will still be a key enabler for electric vehicles, but for now, innovation momentum in battery swapping is higher, Lux says, while graphene and other 2D materials continue to drive research and  patenting, but integration and manufacturing challenges will slow adoption.Lux warns that while it is important to keep up with what is going on in your own industry, you should cast a wider net as well. “The top techs in each industry are  essential to be on top of, but the next great innovation to impact your industry might come from well outside it as well,” the report says. “Most innovation organizations are fairly adept at monitoring innovations from within their own industry, but a wider view is critical as well.”These are Lux’s Top Emerging Technologies to Watch for 2021#1 Autonomous Vehicles#2 Natural Language Processing#3 Plastic Recycling#4 AI-Enabled Sensors#5 Bioinformatics#6 Green Hydrogen#7 Shared Mobility#8 Alternative Proteins#9 3D Printing#10 Materials Informatics#11 Precision Agriculture#12 Synthetic BiologyI write about the intersection of business and the environment and the vital importance of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues to businesses and the""]","['1,214 views']",['Markets'],['https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikescott/2020/11/25/from-autonomous-cars-to-green-hydrogen-here-are-the-top-techs-for-2021/']

(Photo by Dave Thompson/PA ... [+]Britain’s trade deal, or the dread lack of one after leaving the European Union (EU), is worrying the movers and shakers who make, sell, export and import cars and SUVs, but a successful trade deal is still a possibility.The big manufacturers and importers in Britain, including Toyota, Nissan, Jaguar Land Rover, BMW’s Mini and Group PSA’s Vauxhall, have been collectively portraying disaster if a Brexit free trade deal (FTA) FTA -0.5% is not agreed. This would force them to trade on World Trade Organization terms, which means a 10% tariff on exports.This doesn’t necessarily mean the end of the world. For instance, Tesla TSLA +2% has built a fantastic business from scratch in Europe despite having the WTO tariff wall. The secret? Products that people clamor for. A big chunk of Britain’s auto exports are conducted on WTO terms, so it clearly isn’t the kiss of death. Britain’s currency has taken a bit of hit on foreign exchange markets so the 10% tariff wall cost has been breached a little.And Britain has a huge automotive trade deficit with the EU, so it has power in the negotiations.But the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, Britain’s leading automotive industry mouthpiece, believes the sky will fall without an FTA. A couple of weeks ago it said the auto industry has already spent just under $1 billion preparing for Brexit and that it would lose business worth more than $60 billion over the next 5 years without a trade deal.   Negotiations between Britain and the EU are still going on even though a mid-November deadline has passed. Britain formally left the EU on January 31, 2020, and the parties have said the end of this year is the formal deadline for a trade deal. They have to leave a gap to allow EU member states time to ratify the deal by the end of the year.The SMMT renewed its pleas this week for an FTA, saying the cost of failure had risen to $74 billion, while “no deal” would cut Britain’s vehicle production by two million over the next 5 years.  This would also undercut its ability to research and develop the next generation of electric cars.But GlobalData automotive analyst David Leggett allowed himself a positive view of the possibilities for Britain’s auto industry, admittedly with the benefit of an FTA, and notwithstanding his worries without a deal.“A trade deal with the EU would help to lift confidence and boost investment in U.K. manufacturing in 2021. Many investment projects put on hold by future EU-U.K. trading rules uncertainties would get the go-ahead,” Leggett said.GlobalData is a leading data and analytics company.Leggett pointed out that Britain’s auto manufacturing has been hard hit by the coronavirus crisis, with output down a third in 2020 compared with 2019. And the U.K. industry faces an uncertain 2021, topped by the need for an FTA with the EU, without which its competitive position would be damaged as it sought to recover from COVID-19 crisis.According to Office of National Statistics (ONS) data the equivalent of $62 billion of motor vehicle and parts were imported into the U.K. in 2019 from the EU, which generated a $38 billion deficit.Britain now imports over twice the value from the EU than it exports in autos. That would suggest that not only that there will definitely be an FTA agreed, but that the terms will be at least acceptable to Britain.As a former European Automotive correspondent for Reuters, I’ve a spent a few years writing about the industry.

Nearly 125 of its field offices were shuttered and hold times on the agency\'s 800-number line were often infuriatingly long. Then Andrew Saul was sworn in as the agency\'s Commissioner in June 2019, at age 73.The first thing the former chair of the Federal Thrift Investment Board said after taking over was that he\'d fix customer service at Social Security. But soon after he got to work on that, the pandemic hit, forcing the agency to close its field offices except for a few essential services, to protect employees and the public. Saul was undeterred.""To be honest, a year ago, I never thought we would be this far along now,"" Saul told me. ""It did take us time to get up and running, but now we\'re going to reap the rewards of a year\'s planning.""Next Avenue: Why was customer service such a priority for you when you started running the Social Security Administration?Andrew Saul: This agency, I think, probably serves more U.S. citizens and is more important to them than probably any other service that the federal government performs. So, customer service obviously is the most important feature of this organization.And when I came in here, the first thing I did was make it very clear that our job at the agency, meaning the whole team, was to service our beneficiaries. Every decision that we make here has to be for the benefit of the beneficiaries. That\'s the mojo here, and that\'s what we are dedicated to do.""This is an agency that needs to move forward. And I think that a lot of what we do was rooted in the past.""How would you describe the state of customer service from the Social Security Administration when you walked in the door? The operating budget had been cut quite a bit, and yet the number of Social Security beneficiaries had been growing.The Social Security Administration gets about ten thousand new customers a day. So, we are a growing business. I think that the vast majority of our employees really are concerned about our beneficiaries and what services we provide.However, this is an agency that needs to move forward. And I think that a lot of what we do was rooted in the past. The people here perform amazing tasks, considering the support systems they had, but it\'s now time, and was time a year ago, for us to move forward with modern ways to service our customer.How has customer service improved since you\'ve been on the job would you say?Well, first we have to talk about, unfortunately, Covid-19, because there\'s no question you cannot.When I took over here, we had a tremendous amount of plans to digitalize and modernize the way we deliver services. But obviously when March hit and we were faced with this situation, we had to keep the lights on. We had to protect our employees and our beneficiaries, and therefore we had to revert to operating from home.And we were forced to close our offices, both our field offices and our disability hearing offices, and become a virtual operation. We had no choice.So, the service that we were delivering was interrupted, but considering what happened, this team did an amazing job. And I think if you talk to people that use our services on an active basis, they\'ll say we really made a transformation here which was basically seamless.Look, I\'m not saying everything was perfect. It still isn\'t perfect. The last six months have really pressed the team to the limits. But having said that, I think we\'ve done a great job in keeping the lights on and keeping the old boiler running.Now what this [Covid-19] has taught us and what we\'ve been doing is changing the way we do business. And I think it\'s going to be changed forever.It doesn\'t mean that we\'re not going to have field offices. It doesn\'t mean that we\'re not going to have an eight-hundred [toll-free] number. But we are going as quickly as we can so that our major form of communication to our customer is digital and video.How are you shifting to providing customer service online?As far as the field offices go, we are transforming as fast as we can to a much more online operation. We have something called the my Social Security account; fifty-three million Americans today have one. [It lets you check your Social Security statement, change your address for benefits, verify your earnings and estimate future Social Security benefits.]And what we\'re going to do over the next twelve months is increase that number through a major [marketing] campaign to over a hundred million my Social Security accounts. That will provide the ability for our customer to go online and be able to do a tremendous amount of the things that they would normally do in person or on the eight-hundred number.""When we hopefully go back and roll out our field office operations again, we\'re going to be using many more personal appointments.""And what about people who call Social Security?The other major change we are now rolling out is all new technology for our eight-hundred telephone number.We have hired a thousand more operators, which is something I did a year ago. The second tranche of five hundred is being trained as we speak. Plus, the new system that we\'re rolling out with Verizon will enable us to improve the eight-hundred service tremendously.And the field offices?When we hopefully go back and roll out our field office operations again, we\'re going to be using many more personal appointments rather than having people just come into the office. I believe the offices are going to be much better organized, with express service for certain things that people come in for on a much more regular basis.What about the Social Security Administration\'s website?We\'re going to have a new website, completely redesigned, which is something that is important because it\'s our most important face to our customer.How far along did you get before you had to pivot in March with the pandemic?We had most of this underway. And you know, the amazing thing about systems work is you can do it offsite.I\'m not going to tell you this [Covid-19] didn\'t slow us down, because we had to be able to go from an in-office to a virtual operation. Did it slow us down? Yes, it did slow us down, but now we\'re running well.Before the offices were shut down for the pandemic, a lot of people would come into the offices to ask questions and sign up for retirement benefits. How much has closing the field offices slowed down the number of applications that have come in?You know, it is somewhat slower. What\'s happened is we have many more eight-hundred number calls. We also have many more calls to the individual offices.The other thing is: We are getting tremendous amount of hits on our website. I think it\'s up fifty, sixty percent. We\'ve been getting almost a million hits a day. Wow.And we are doing about fifty-three percent of our transactions online through those that have the my Social Security account.Most people who get their Social Security retirement benefits get them by direct deposit or a government issued debit card.Ninety-five percent.So, for the other five percent, has the pandemic and what\'s been going on with the postal service affected people getting their paper checks on a regular basis when they expect?You know, I don\'t know that this is a problem. I don\'t believe it is. I still have confidence in the Postal Service. I\'m aware there may be hiccups here, but it\'s not something that\'s been a major problem for us.In 2010, the Social Security Administration mailed out a hundred and fifty five million annual statements telling people what their retirement or disability benefits would be, but in 2018 it mailed under fifteen million. Do you have any plans to send out more annual paper statements?People may view their Social Security statement at my Social Security. But we are totally modernizing our paper statements — new format, new statement, much easier to read. So, we\'re not in any way canceling that form of communication, but we\'re going to modernize it.But you\'re not going to go back to the way it had been a few years ago where pretty much everybody got one in the mail?No, because all you gotta do is go on your my Social Security account and you\'ll get the same thing a lot quicker and easier. And in a more modern format online. Once a person has a my Social Security account, they do not receive a paper statement in the mail because they can view their statement anytime through their account.Most people start claiming Social Security around age sixty-two, often for financial reasons. But analysts say some claim that early because they don\'t understand the rules and that if they delayed claiming, they would get an eight percent bigger benefit check in the future. They suggest that instead of Social Security saying \'early eligibility age\', call it the \'minimum benefit age.\' What do you think?If you go to our website now, you will see our first phase of modernized information for our customers on retirement benefits. That hadn\'t been updated for many years. And over the next year, we are going to modernize the tools that we give the customer so they can better make their [claiming] decision a better-informed decision.Are you planning to change the language at all?What we\'re doing is trying to make it easier for the lay person to understand, I want to make sure people have modern tools to help them, but not to make the decision for them.What else would you like to do to improve customer service?We\'re going to have to see what happens when we start reopening the offices to the public.I don\'t know how much you knew about the offices before, but it was terrible. I used to go visit these offices and some of the busy ones were really a disaster, in my opinion — just people sitting around waiting. I don\'t want that anymore. We can\'t have that.I have to ask you about Social Security\'s solvency, which has been made worse with the pandemic. Fewer people are working, so there is less in payroll taxes coming in. What do you tell people who are worried that they\'re not going to get the Social Security retirement benefits they\'re supposed to receive?Well, look, there\'s no question that people aren\'t working and they\'re not paying the FICA taxes. It\'s going to hurt the trust funds.And I\'m one of the four trustees for the Medicare and Social Security trust fund. The last meeting we had showed that The Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Fund was projected to become depleted in 2035 without making any changes in the plans. But I think that Congress is going to have to do something in order to keep the things solvent.And I think they should do something about it.That\'s Congress\'s responsibility, not ours. And we\'ll see how the trust funds are a year from now when we make the next report. But as it looks to me, I don\'t think this is seriously going to change the solvency year, unless this thing [Covid-19] becomes much more severe than it currently is.So, anybody retiring between now and 2035, unless things get much worse with a pandemic, shouldn\'t be concerned about their benefits being reduced. But the closer we get to 2034, the more important it is for something to get done to make sure that everybody gets where they\'re expecting?I think that\'s correct. I think that\'s a pretty good assumption.What do you want Americans to know about Social Security scams, with con artists pretending to be from the Social Security Administration?This whole scam fraud thing is really a big problem. It\'s unbelievable. And unfortunately, I do believe it\'s getting worse. We\'ve tried to do everything from social media to all kinds of advertising, but the customer has to be aware that if they get the scam calls, hang up. Don\'t give them any information. That\'s the key.A lot of people, especially elderly people, become victims and fall for this thing, which is not good. And it\'s just an awareness thing. They have to know that our agents don\'t threaten people or anything like that.If you could change one thing about aging in America, what would it be? For all Americans to have and to take the opportunity to save enough to live comfortably as they age. We offer tools to help. For example, you can open your own my Social Security account to verify your earnings, get a personalized Social Security Statement and get future benefit estimates.How has the Covid-19 pandemic changed your perspective on aging?It underscored that this is an especially vulnerable population in need of our attention and support. Social Security is set up as a contract between generations and that contract should be more than just economic. It is terrible to think of older Americans living in further isolation because of pandemic quarantines. A saving grace is technology. Technology is the reason we\'ve been able to communicate with the public and keep our services open.Next Avenue is public media’s first and only national journalism service for America’s booming older population.

That means holiday shopping will be different too. Don’t expect to do a lot of in-store shopping as cities around the country go into second rounds of lockdowns and Covid cases continue to spike. And many people probably won’t want to spend a ton of money on gifts this year. That’s okay. There are ways you can save and still make the season a merry one. Here are five ways to do it:We often equate gift giving to mean gifting someone with an object. This year, try giving the gift of time. If you can meet safely outside, spend a socially distanced happy hour with friends or call up a girlfriend across the country to chat on a Friday night. As the pandemic continues, so does our isolation. Setting aside time to connect with friends is important (and free!). This year more than ever, people will appreciate spending quality time with loved ones—whether it’s over FaceTime or safely at a distance—than receiving an overly- priced candle. Keep it personal this year.When trying to save for anything—whether it’s for a spa day or that cool poster you’ve been eyeing—it’s good to keep a separate account. This way you won’t be tempted to dip into it. The nice thing about accounts, too, is that once the money is in there, you’re likely to forget it exists and won’t accidentally spend it. A holiday account doesn’t need to be for expensive items, either. Don’t think of this as an entire savings account for a down payment on a house. It just needs to be a place to set aside money—whatever the amount. Instead of giving expensive presents, suggest doing a budget-friendly shared activity and paying for it. Even in a pandemic, there’s a way to give activities. Find a movie you and a friend want to watch and rent it on Amazon Prime. You can watch together over FaceTime. Or buy the same book for you and a friend and read it at the same time. By giving smaller gifts that are interactive, you likely won’t spend more than $20. You’ll also be able to partake in the gift and that makes it more fun. Take advantage of the deals being offered this year. Some retailers are already planning to extend or shift sales. Amazon moved its Prime Day up from July to October. Keep an eye out for other stores making similar moves, especially local ones. As Amazon sales have boomed this year, small companies are likely looking to make up business lost to the online giant. And the holidays are important. If you see an item you like but it’s too expensive, ask if it’s going on sale or whether they’d give you a price break. It’s a good time to negotiate.Because there have been delays at the post office and shipping is a nightmare, you should start your holiday shopping early to avoid delays. And since most of us are online shopping, this will save you from paying higher shipping costs the closer we get to the holidays. Before you start buying though, list out the items you want to buy and from where. You don’t want to have to pay a shipping fee twice. Plan to pay an additional $10 for shipping and if you end up getting free shipping, consider that money back into your holiday account.Remember that if holiday shopping and gift giving is just too hard this year, you can always send money. Sending money isn’t as gauche as it used to be. It’s even nice to receive a surprise $10 in your Venmo account from a friend. It shows that someone was thinking of you and wanted to treat you to something special. Don’t make holiday shopping this year the stressful event it is every other year.I'm the New York Times Bestselling author of Rich Bitch and Boss Bitch and the host of the nationally syndicated business reality competition show, “Hatched.” I've been""]",['592 views'],['Personal Finance'],['https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicolelapin/2020/11/25/five-ways-holiday-shopping-will-be-different-this-year/']

The absence of infrastructure from U.S. grand strategy is a fatal flaw. Without a strong foundation at home, and the productivity and opportunity that it creates, we simply cannot lead internationally. The emperor has no clothes - we won’t wield the resources, or even the concepts, required to be the leader in this historically challenging moment. We need to make that investment, so that we will no longer inevitably and all too consistently default to the hard power option (force), or - owing to an increasingly weak base - retreat in disarray from the world. Robust investment in U.S. strategic infrastructure is the right path, the only path, the commitment we have to make.Global leadership makes sense from another perspective, as well. The US infrastructure market weighs in at a dramatically underperforming $270 billion (1.3% of GDP), while crying out for an equilibrium investment level well above $600 billion. The global infrastructure market, which China is winning, is at $2.7 trillion market, ten times larger than our domestic market.If grand strategy is the organization of a country’s resources to secure its place in the world - and if that is what the Biden Administration intends to do - then we better quickly invest in the landmark infrastructure capabilities that are at our fingertips, strengthening our core resources, building alliances, transforming the strategic chessboard. Three areas need to occupy the attention of our strategists - and the leaders deputized to carry out that strategy:Rebuild the (Soft Power) Arsenal. With the erosion of our will to build, an enormous tension has emerged globally between what we say and what we can do. The capacities that we have in our mind’s eye - like an aging athlete - are simply, brutally, no longer matched by fact. This must change. Developing countries have a crying need for clean water, better connectivity, and reliable electricity - an explosive issue for their leaders - and while we respond with promises and platitudes, China takes a different approach: massive internal infrastructure investment (6-7% of GDP, a $2 trillion initiative focused on new infrastructure), the creation of a new development bank, and the launch of the transformative Belt & Road Initiative, financing and building infrastructure across Central Asia, Africa and Latin America.  We need to take a good look at where we are, and both build up our infrastructure arsenal, and the institutions that support market-based, people-focused, projects. We need to recognize the illness, and treat that disease. In a report that I authored for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2014, we showed that of the last 50 projects won in Latin America only one had been won by a U.S. firm. The story was the same in Africa, and Central Asia, and has only gotten worse in the last six year. The remedy is to bring our strengths - technology, private investment, a focus on people - to the game, along with best in class companies, like Xylem XYL +0.5%, applying technology to the global challenge of water, or Trimble, creating whole new ways of visualizing infrastructure opportunities, or Oracle ORCL +0.6%, building a revolution in government transparency, and so facilitating innovation, productivity and results.  Map of the Top 50 Projects Won in Latin America, 2014The Strategic Objective is the Mind of Man. The tendency is to focus on confronting and containing China, but that is only a byproduct - albeit a happy one - of the right strategy. In global leadership - and in driving global prosperity - it’s much more powerful to think in terms of grabbing the attention of people, and the gratitude of their leaders. We have a big advantage. Fifty-seven percent of the world’s countries are democracies (and according to Pew an additional 28% are some combination of democracy and autocracy), so what we are offering - economic opportunity, and education and health offer - is not only what people around the world want, but it creates an opportunity to dramatically increase the number of democracies, and the quality of those democracies.  The late, great, World Bank president Jim Wolfensohn wanted to put a smile on the face of every child. If we limit ourselves to focusing on the adversary, then we remove aspiration and vision from strategy, making it that much harder to launch and sustain the concert of global leadership so critical at this moment.  It’s not just investment that matters, but reputation too. In a survey we conducted earlier this year 82% of global infrastructure executives saw infrastructure as a “weak or average” brand. Not only do we have to invest internally, but we to re-create the reputation of the enterprise - no shortcuts, our work is cut out for us, but perhaps the fun is proportional to the enormity of the challenge?  The Infrastructure Brand, GloballyBuild the Network, Stupid. The right Grand Strategy is going to create a network of successful projects in countries around the world. Building projects that people need - or refurbishing old projects to dramatically enhance their performance (a clean water plant, or an electric power project, both green, both necessary), or building - or ensuring, in the case of Georgia - access to high speed internet, or the results of AI research - creates more than goodwill and gratitude, it creates a virtuous platform in every country in which a project is built. These projects in turn create powerful networks of builders, technologists, financiers and users across market-based democracies.  This should not be cast as a U.S. business opportunity, although it is that, par excellence. It is a U.S. strategic leadership opportunity - creating a network of allies around the world, building and knitting together billions of dollars worth of projects, creating visible successes in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The right approach will create a perpetual motion machine of success, not unlike what was created after World War II, releasing a huge amount of creative and productive energy. This bigger than life alternative to the Chinese, and bending towards liberty, will arrive on the scene in the knick of time.  Action Items for the Biden Administration’s Grand Strategy. A reemergent U.S. global leadership role, built on infrastructure investment, and created with our allies to focus on allied democracies around the world, seems right. For some time, countries around the world have demanded increased infrastructure investment (including social infrastructure - schools and hospitals); these wants are now needs, critical to resourcing countries in their Covid recovery strategies. Here are the four key action items that would deliver progress in the first 100 days of the Biden Administration:  First, focus on and ensure the creation of a robust domestic U.S. infrastructure initiative, spearheaded by the kind of technology investment in new infrastructure (from 5G to AI, and autonomous vehicles and smart city platforms) that is our strength. Success begins at home, period.Second, create an I-20, an Infrastructure 20, of key countries around the world who are major infrastructure players, including developed countries like Australia and Japan, and also big infrastructure producers, like India, Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey, and include smaller allies like Vietnam and Colombia.  Don’t make infrastructure an orphan.Third, build a Benefits Index that identifies priority projects of the people in democracies, do they can guide and believe in their leadership. Create a mechanism so that people around the world have a voice, and be disciplined in a) listening to those voices closely, and delivering what they want - especially now.Fourth, create a strategic infrastructure office in the White House, built around critical technologies and innovative ideas of private investment. This is an enormously complex issue, with technology advances that both enhance performance (the velocity of innovation is critical for infrastructure) and that require guidance (we need a national conversation on AI).  The resources that the U.S. requires for global leadership do not currently exist, because our ability to counter the Chinese in global infrastructure investment does not exist. We need a whole of government approach to quickly bring these resources up to the required level, just as we need to bring the world together to create the investment, productivity, sustainability and opportunity that will mark our success.  In a week that began with the roll-out of a new foreign policy team, and musings on how to use hard and soft power to reassert global leadership, let me close by highlighting two hard, cold, facts: this is a big moment, as big as the one that yielded the creation of the Bretton Woods accords - Covid, economic threats and technology transformation are disruptions of a magnitude equivalent to global war; and, a very different point, global leadership will sit well with us, not only because we are the only alternative the world has, but because the measurable successes of this effort - working with people around the world to build projects, and the health and mobility benefits of those projects - will provide us all with a wonderful modern portrait of who we are, and who we can be.As Lincoln said, in a time at least as trying as our own: “The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.”I am the Chairman & CEO of CG/LA Infrastructure, a firm focused on global infrastructure project development, driving productivity across countries, and maximizing the']",['180 views'],['Investing'],['https://www.forbes.com/sites/normananderson/2020/11/27/biden-grand-strategy--infrastructureglobal-leadership-and-a-27-trillion-market/']

They learned a lot during the process about how to pitch their mission.“Start with a personal anecdote—paint a picture for your audience,” offers the 2020 30 Under 30 honoree and Cornell University graduate in computer science and engineering. “If you tell a real story about yourself, it makes the pitch more relatable. Be natural and don’t force anything.“Second,” Gupta says, “your audience needs to know you’re the right person to make this idea real. Stress right away that you have the appropriate skill sets and the relevant experience for the job. “Third, if investors don’t understand the problem your idea is intended to solve, your idea isn’t going to make any sense to them.

What works when you’re standing in front of a conference room full of people with the power to make your project come to life?“A pitch should tell a story,” says Quist, who got hooked on the music business when he promoted Dallas-area concerts as a student at Southern Methodist University. “And like every good story, it should have a beginning, a middle and an end.“Be sure, too, to make clear what’s unique about your product/business. You’d be surprised to learn how many pitches I’ve been through that don’t include that key point.“Finally,” Quist says, “explain your revenue model and growth plan.

[+]This Black Friday, the winners in the battle between store-based and ecommerce retailers will be the companies that are quickest to get what consumers order into their eager clutches.Thanks to investments they’ve made over the last decade, Walmart and Best Buy could get the edge over Amazon this year.How so? Walmart and Best Buy let consumers order online and pickup their goods at the store while maintaining social distance from those who bring the goods curbside. For example, as I wrote in my new book, Goliath Strikes Back, Best Buy stores are a 15 minute drive from 70% of American households so consumers can order online and get contactless pickup at the stores as quickly as an hour later.Meanwhile, Amazon Prime’s two-day delivery promise is becoming more well known for all the items that can’t be delivered within that time frame, according to Boston’s ABC affiliate WCVB.At stake is a surprisingly large revenue opportunity for consumer retailers. According to the Washington Post, the National Retail Federation projected 3.6% to 5.2% growth (above the 3.5% five year average) to between $755 billion to $767 billion. Online sales could pop as much as 30% to $218 billion this year.Walmart, Best Buy and Amazon are offering Black Friday deals aimed at getting a slice of this large pie. Before placing orders, here are four caveatsWalmart is offering “thousands” of deals of which, according to People, the 36 best includeTechCrunch reports that Best Buy’s deals includeHere’s a sampling of Amazon Black Friday electronics deals :Analysts expect Amazon revenue in the range of $112 billion to $121 billion in the period ending in December — above the $112.5 billion analyst consensus. according to Bloomberg.Can Amazon meet consumers’ home delivery expectations. Although its CFO, Brian Olsavsky said Amazon had spent heavily to open staging and sorting facilities closer to big cities, he urged consumers to shop early, Bloomberg noted.Best Buy this week reported revenue and growth for the third quarter that exceeded expectations for the third quarter. Revenue of $11.85 billion was $850 million more than Refinitiv estimates while same store sales popped 23% — 9.4 percentage points faster than StreetAccount estimates, according to CNBC.But Best Buy did not offer fourth quarter guidance — which spooked investors.Walmart also beat expectations in the third quarter. Its revenue of $134.7 billion was $2.5 billion more than Refinitiv estimates; U.S. same-store sales rose 6.4% — 2.5 percentage points faster than expected by StreetAccount survey, according to CNBC.Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce sales popped 79% in the third quarter. More customers are shipping purchases to their homes or picking up online at curbside which Walmart CEO Doug McMillon expects to persist in the future.Two-day shipping from Amazon isn\'t guaranteed, even on products that display the familiar Prime logo. “For those looking for a last-minute turkey baster this week on Amazon, they needed to look closely at the shipping details to actually get the product they wanted before Thanksgiving. WCVB found several on [November 23] that included the Prime logo — which is used to indicate two-day shipping — except these wouldn\'t have arrived until Saturday, five days later.”No doubt the crush of demand and the challenge of getting enough logistics capacity to meet satisfy that demand will disappoint many consumers.Amazon, UPS and FedEx FDX -0.3% are competing to delivery vans ""during a record surge in package volumes,"" and shortages are being reported as leasing companies scour the rental market for used vans, noted LinkedIn News.We should find out in January whether the holiday season proved that contactless store pickup — offered by Walmart and Best Buy — was a better way to get goods in consumers’ hands faster than Amazon Prime.I ditched corporate America in 1994 and started a management consulting and venture capital firm (http://petercohan.com).

[+]Many readers will be aware of Treasury Secretary Mnuchin’s announcement last week that the Treasury will be discontinuing the CARES Act programs that it has been co-administering with the Fed, under the latter’s Section 13(3) authority, since last April. As I wrote in response to that announcement, this move should actually be considered a ‘gift’ to the Fed. For Secretary Mnuchin was preventing these programs’ functioning as much more than window dressing, while the Fed itself can continue these programs in more sensible forms - forms that cohere with their advertised purposes - on its own under its Section 14 authority.The resumed spiking of Covid infection rates is now making clear that the Fed must do as recommended last week, at least until such time as we have a new White House Administration and Treasury two months from now. The nation requires stopgap Fed assistance at least over December and most of January. The following open letter accordingly makes the case for CARES Act continuation - and optimization - to Chairman Powell, and explains what optimization in this case consists in.Dear Chairman Powell,Like you, we were surprised by Secretary Mnuchin’s announced plan to discontinue the CARES Act programs that you have been administering under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act (FRA) since April. We write to urge you to continue the programs, in optimized form, using your FRA Section 14 authority – at least until a new Treasury Secretary can resume them under Section 13(3) in late January.   As you know, our States and their Subdivisions continue to operate as our nation’s ‘front-line’ responders to the national Covid pandemic. In effect, they are functioning as our de facto federal pandemic response agencies, and will be doing so at least until well into next year.  Meanwhile, Covid infection rates are again spiking and business activity is beginning to contract yet again, as changing weather forces people back indoors and many small businesses now shutter for good. These new developments, already devastating in their own right, will bring further fiscal crises to States and their Subdivisions, not to mention their millions of residents and small businesses, in the weeks ahead.  Against this backdrop, new rounds of public sector layoffs, as well as individual and small business defaults and evictions, will throw us back into the crisis conditions of late last winter. We fear that our nation will not be able to endure this. Some stopgap measures will be urgently needed to keep States, Cities, and small businesses afloat until a new Presidential Administration and Congress take office next year.We urge you, then, to maintain at least your Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF) and Main Street Lending Program (MSLP) under your FRA Section 14 authority, which does not require Treasury involvement or approval, until a new Treasury Secretary takes office next January. Because the sole restriction on the paper that Section 14 authorizes you to monetize is that it be of 6 months’ maturity or less, you are well within your statutory authority to do this over the next several months.   We also urge you to continue the MLF and MSLP measures under more liberal terms than you’ve imposed hitherto, now that Secretary Mnuchin, who we understand to have insisted on the earlier terms, is no longer in the picture. Our suggestions for stopgap MLF and MSLP reform are the following: 1. Loosen MLF Rate & Rating RequirementsWhat: Excise all municipal bond rating, ‘market rate,’ and ‘penalty rate’ requirements from the MLF Term Sheet.Why: The MLF is not a Bagehotian Lender of Last Resort (LOLR) Facility. Pandemic- struck States and their Subdivisions are not ‘too big to fail’ (TBTF) financial institutions that have brought on their own plight through reckless speculation on secondary financial and derivatives markets. Aiding them without ‘co-insurance’ or ‘deductibles’ raises no moral hazard concerns as it does in the case of Wall Street institutions. They are, again, at least for now our de facto federal pandemic response agencies, correspondingly in need of real federal funding.2. Determine MLF Eligibility Criteria Solely on a Per Capita, not Categorical BasisWhat: Liberalize MLF Term Sheet terms by (a) including U.S. Territories and Tribes among Eligible Issuers as prescribed by the CARES Act, and (b) lowering or eliminating the population thresholds for Eligible Issuers, disbursing funds on a per capita basis instead.Why: As noted above, our subnational units of government are now functioning as de facto federal agencies in addressing our national pandemic. All units engaged in this task should accordingly be funded as federal agencies, and, to paraphrase Mr. Draghi, for ‘as long as it takes.’ Ideally, we would eliminate arbitrary population thresholds altogether, and distribute moneys on a per capita basis to all State and Sub-State agencies performing de facto federal pandemic mitigation work. But if thresholds are needed for ease of administration, we urge you to lower them well below where they currently stand – say, 50,000 for counties and 10,000 for cities.3.    Distribute MLF and MSLP Administration Over All FRBsWhat: Distribute MLF and MSLP administration over all of the regional Federal Reserve Banks (FRBs) rather than housing them solely in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.Why: Unlike the Fed Facilities pioneered in 2008-09, which focused primarily on large financial institutions and accordingly made sense to administer out of FRBNY, the MLF and MSLP target subnational units of government and small businesses across the entirety of our continental republic. It thereby implicates the rationale that prompted the Fed’s regionally ‘distributed’ structure in the first place in 1913. It is neither efficient nor fair to expect small staffs in Lower Manhattan and Boston, even as able and diligent as they are, to be up to the task of arranging adequate financing for literally thousands of Issuers with regionally varying needs nationwide. We urge you, then, to ‘spread’ administration of these inherently localized programs locally – across all of the FRBs.Thank you for your consideration, and please do not hesitate to let us know if we might clarify the foregoing in any way.

For those with different money values, it’s a model that can serve divided households well.Consider these prompts for an upcoming get-together or Zoom chat:Colleagues, friends and broader community members were happy to share their thoughts when asked the same questions:In the oldies but goodies category.The perennial “pay yourself first” mantra is always front and center. Individuals shared recommendations on utilizing automatic transfers into savings and investment accounts to help achieve that goal. The pay yourself first notion was also countered with the balancing act of saving enough for a rainy day, but also remembering to enjoy life. Paying bills on time, paying off principal on loans, and not carrying a balance on credit cards rounded out the list of “oldies but goodies.”The takeaways: focus on the fundamentals - be sure to put some of your paycheck into savings, pay your bills on time, and make sure to enjoy some of your hard earned money.Care for your biggest assets!The importance of owning and taking care of a vehicle has always been apparent. One person remarked that besides providing transportation, it could also be used for shelter and heat, and had once allowed them to keep their job and find better work until they could settle into a new apartment. For many, a car is one of the most valuable assets they will own, and taking care of those assets is a smart step, as well as a larger metaphor for wealth building in general. The takeaways: regardless of the make, model and year, a car is one of the biggest assets most people possess. Be sure to keep up on oil changes and regular maintenance so it can serve you well for years to come.File under: good life lessons.Sometimes lessons about wealth building serve as good life lessons too! One commenter shared that her parents and other Hispanic parents were always focused on saving money growing up. When she was little she’d ask “what is it that you're saving for!? Are we going on a family vacation?”  But the reason was always “just in case”. Her parents worked and worked without truly enjoying their money. Heartbreakingly, she shared that her dad had worked since he was ten years old and passed away at the young age of 64, having only enjoyed his retirement for three years. To this, she shared that the mantra of ‘saving as much as you can’ can be both a good and bad example.Being a thoughtful consumer and evaluating needs before purchases, as well as repurposing items that are already owned, is both an economically- and environmentally-smart decision. One individual proclaimed that continuous self-education had the best Return on Investment, and that considering money as a tool and not a goal, was a great mindset. Let’s keep these top of mind heading into the new year.The takeaways: balancing wants and needs is a larger part of maturity and adulthood, and if the pandemic has taught us anything it’s that being prepared and appreciating the joy in each and everyday are concepts not to be overlooked. Now, it’s your turn to pass it onPerhaps it’s not surprising that one commenter recalled never receiving financial advice at all, her parents lived paycheck to paycheck and didn’t save much of anything; she was the first to attend college. The advice she now shares with her children is to “save/spend/share” - one-third each. And to be mindful of where the “spend” part goes towards.This is a great reminder that we can always move future generations forward by leaning on what we did, and did not, learn from our relatives and doing our best to guide our children in the right direction.This concept of neither success nor failure being a final destination is an important reminder of how necessary it is to talk about real issues with the ones we love. This holiday season, whether in-person or virtually, take time to connect with family and friends both young and old.

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), speaks during her weekly press briefing on Capitol ... [+]Roll Call reported Monday that the Thanksgiving holiday was seen as a crucial deadline for appropriators to reach an agreement on the budget so that staff could have enough time to draft the omnibus spending bill and pass it before the December deadline. Lawmakers had originally aimed to reach an agreement on an omnibus spending bill for all of 2021—not a temporary continuing resolution—by the end of last week. But negotiators encountered roadblocks, including over the nearly $2 billion that the GOP wants to allocate for a border wall and a proposed change from both parties to healthcare funding for veterans.The Senate GOP’s budget proposal did not include any additional coronavirus aid measures, but the House Democrats’ proposal did. It isn’t impossible that a few aid provisions—like extensions of key pandemic programs set to expire at the end of the year—might make it into the budget, but that will depend on whether appropriators left any room in their topline agreement for the emergency measures. “We have been working on the omnibus bill, and I thought that would be a segue into [more coronavirus relief],” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said during a press briefing last Friday. “Let's hope that it is.”15 days. That’s how long lawmakers have before the December 11 shutdown deadline.If the deadline comes and goes before Congress passes a spending bill, federal agencies will be forced to shut down some of their discretionary functions (excluding essential services) until new funding legislation is enacted, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. That could affect the administrative functions of the Social Security Administration (though checks will still be sent out) and Medicare program, IRS mortgage and loan approvals, air travel, national parks and more, the CRFP said.

78,['https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/07/23/historical-stock-market-returns-under-every-us-president/'],['We Looked At How The Stock Market Performed Under Every U.S. President Since Truman — And The Results Will Surprise You'],"[""C\nonventional wisdom says that those liberal Dems are generally bad for the economy and the stock market because of their big government tendencies, while fiscally conservative Republicans are good. This widely accepted belief is actually fake news if you look at data going back to the end of World War II.“Stock markets do perform better under Democrats than under Republicans. That’s a well-known fact, but it does not imply cause and effect,” says Jeremy Siegel, the Russell E. Palmer Professor of Finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. From 1952 through June 2020, annualized real stock market returns under Democrats have been 10.6% compared with 4.8% for Republicans. With the 2020 election less than four months away, some investors are fretting about the pros and cons of a Trump vs. Biden presidency. A Democratic sweep would almost certainly mean a rollback of Trump’s massive corporate tax cut (a negative for stocks), but additional economic stimulus (which the market apparently loves despite deficit implications) and stability on the China trade front would be a big positive. According to Siegel, author of the 1994 investment classic Stocks For The Long Run, Wall Street’s obsession with politics is mostly misplaced: “Bull markets and bear markets come and go, and it’s more to do with business cycles than presidents.” In some ways the current environment has characteristics of the existential threat faced by George W. Bush post-2001 (replace terrorism with pandemic), the civil unrest that plagued the Johnson and Nixon administrations and Ronald Reagan’s trade war with Japan in the 1980s. In an effort to more closely examine the relationship between the actions of a president and the direction of stocks, Forbes has analyzed their stock market performances, including dividends, dating back to Harry Truman. Using data from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), we’ve also noted for each president the number of expansions and recessions that began during their tenures. In some cases like the presidency of Bill Clinton, who was in office during one of the most impressive periods of economic prosperity (and bull markets) in history, you won't see an expansion listed. That’s because credit is awarded to the president who was in office during its inception, which in this case was George H.W. Bush. We also included the ratio of gross federal debt to GDP for the final year of each presidency.The winner among presidents for the best cumulative stock market return is William J. Clinton, with nearly 210%. The worst: George W. Bush, with -40%. Uncertainty has been the biggest disrupter of markets by far. In September 1955, for example, stocks dove 6.5% in a single day when Eisenhower suffered a sudden heart attack after a golf outing. When Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963 the immediate fall off was 3%. In both instances stocks promptly recovered. Market gyrations aside, investors can take comfort in the fact that in the long run, buy and hold worked best. A $1,000 investment in an index of large U.S. stocks in January 1945, would have compounded at an annual total return of 11% and would have been worth $2.3 million by the end of 2019.Coming out of the Second World War, war-time production leveled off and job losses ensued. As a result, Truman faced a recession and bear market early in his term. “There were excesses in the economy from so many people returning from war and jobs not being available—it was almost inevitable we were going to hit a recession,” says James Stack, president of InvesTech Research and Stack Financial Management. The economy bounced back quickly as consumer and business confidence returned, but Truman then faced another recession (albeit brief) in 1949 after his Fair Deal economic reforms which raised the minimum wage and tried to guarantee equal employment rights.While the vastly popular President Eisenhower helped obtain a truce in the Korean War and worked to ease Cold War tensions, America still experienced its share of anxiety during his tenure thanks to Red Scare tactics. “Many people say how great and unexciting the Eisenhower years were, but I beg to differ,” says Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA. “America was petrified. Duck and cover was our favorite theme song,” he adds, noting that the Soviet Union acquired the hydrogen bomb during this period and Americans were dealing with McCarthyism and the Wisconsin Senator’s hearings at the same time. Eisenhower faced three recessions during his two terms in office—one in the beginning, middle and end of his tenure. The recessions of 1953 and 1958 were in large part tied to more restrictive monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, while another recession started in 1960—after the Fed had doubled interest rates since 1958.President John F. Kennedy was elected in a close-run affair, campaigning under the slogans like “Getting America Moving Again” and “A Time For Greatness.” The economy remained sluggish and unemployment remained high at 6.8% when he took office. The one bear market under his term “was triggered by nothing other than Kennedy getting in a pissing match with U.S. Steel over prices,” says Stovall. “Wall Street didn’t like the government dictating what private companies could do.” Toward the end of his term, JFK launched a bold domestic program, including income and corporate tax cuts, to spur economic growth before his tragic assassination on November 22, 1963.President Johnson was sworn in aboard Air Force One before flying back to Washington on the day of Kennedy’s assassination, and the Texan quickly moved to pass JFK’s tax cuts and Civil Rights legislation. Amid rising inflation and interest rates and rising civil unrest associated with the Civil Rights movement, stocks entered a bear market in 1966. A recession was avoided after the Federal Reserve panicked and reduced interest rates. A second bear market hit in 1968, just as Vietnam War protests were heating up. “There was a valuation and speculation problem on Wall Street that was similar to the late 1990s,” says Stack referring to the so-called go-go era when glamour stocks including IBM, Texas Instruments, Gulf & Western, Polaroid and Xerox led the charge. While Johnson didn’t preside over a formal recession, “he did end up creating problems for the next administration because of the ‘guns and butter’ philosophy of paying for the Vietnam War,” along with Great Society social programs, says Stovall.Monetary tightening at the end of Johnson's tenure resulted in a mild recession from 1969 to 1970, after President Nixon took office. The U.S. economy was plagued by stagflation—high inflation, slow economic growth and high unemployment. In 1970, a year before taking the U.S. completely off the gold standard, Nixon, by executive order, imposed a freeze on wages and prices in an effort to battle inflation. “It was a very non-Republican thing to do. It backfired and unraveled shortly after,” Siegel notes. In 1973, the Arab oil embargo led to skyrocketing oil prices, and the Watergate scandal imperiled Nixon’s presidency. A stock market crash cleaved the value of the S&P 500 nearly in half between January 1973 and October 1974, accompanied by double-digit inflation and a 16-month recession that began in the fall of 1973.President Ford presided over the last two years of Nixon’s second-term, inheriting many of the economic problems of his predecessor. Stagflation continued into Ford’s tenure, but the stock market rebounded in 1975. “It was a very short term in office and not very notable from a historical perspective to investors,” says Stack.In terms of the economy and the stock market, the peanut farmer and former governor from the state of Georgia didn’t have an easy time in office. Inflation continued to plague the U.S. economy and by 1979 it had reached double-digit levels. “It was a very stressful time for investors and the Federal Reserve,” says Stack, adding that 1980 was the “wildest year in monetary history.” A recession hit in January, but was over by July 1980 after the Fed reversed course and brought interest rates down somewhat. One year later, however, a deeper recession hit shortly after Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker—in an attempt to fight the inflation of the 1970s— “put his foot on the brake by raising interest rates dramatically,” says Stovall. Carter’s term in office was also marked by an energy crisis following the Iranian Revolution that deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in February 1979, and led to revolutionaries seizing the U.S. embassy in Tehran in November and holding hostages until the end of Carter’s presidency. Inflation raged and gold prices spiked to new highs of above $800 per ounce. In November 1980, former actor and California governor Reagan won the presidential election in a landslide.During Reagan’s first term, the U.S. fell into another recession—one of the longest in the post-war period, but that downturn was long enough that it “broke the back of inflation,” Stack says. The harsh medicine to fight inflation was higher rates that eventually took the U.S. Treasury yield above 16% in August 1981. Stocks bottomed one year later, and the U.S. emerged from recession in November 1982. When the economy rebounded, it was a “big surprise on and off Wall Street that inflation did not rear its ugly head,” Stack adds. Much of the credit goes to Fed Chairman Volcker, who maintained a tight monetary policy by raising rates. “It was a period of triumph. Communism was in decline, and everyone looked to the West as a free market champion,” Siegel says. “There was a huge feeling of being on top.”Under President Bush, the 41st president, the U.S. economy fell into another recession in 1990, a month before Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait. Oil prices skyrocketed, causing markets to tumble. The Fed had been raising rates to counter inflation once again, Stack says. The economy slowed toward the end of Bush’s term, accompanied by a large commercial real estate bust. Soon after, Bill Clinton’s campaign guru, James Carville, would coin the adage: “It’s the economy stupid.”While Clinton ran his campaign with the promise of reinvigorating the economy, he “inherited ideal economic conditions” for a stock market boom in the 1990s with inflation falling to less than 3%, Stack says. Clinton pushed a tax hike through Congress early in his first term, and the Fed hiked the federal funds rate from 3.25% in January 1994 to 5% in February 1995. Economic growth cooled, and inflation remained in check. “By putting a cap on inflation pressures, it really allowed for the possibility of the first decade-long expansion in Wall Street history,” Stack says. (Though the expansion technically began under his predecessor's watch.) The explosion in technology, including the birth of companies like Amazon and Google, helped boost the stock market to record highs, creating a massive bubble. Fed chair Alan Greenspan warned about “irrational exuberance on Wall Street” in 1996, several years before the internet stock bubble popped, but the Fed didn’t respond fast enough. The bubble and subsequent collapse of the Nasdaq led to a bear market in 2000.As the second President Bush took office, the stock market was still reeling from the dot-com crash: “He couldn’t get anything right—in terms of bad timing and inheriting Clinton’s stock market bubble,” says Stovall. “Bush was book-ended by bears and recessions.” The economy eventually began to recover somewhat as Greenspan and the Federal Reserve methodically raised interest rates again between 2004-2006. But toward the end of Bush’s second term, with interest rates above 5%, the Fed started slashing rates dramatically, setting the stage for a housing bubble.  “It set the environment for creating esoteric mortgages...which ultimately became the demise and contributor to the Great Recession,” notes Stack. By the end of Bush’s tenure, the U.S. economy was in the depths of a financial crisis that saw historic institutions like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers disappear. “We haven’t had a worse president for the economy than G.W. Bush, at least not since Hoover,” says Charles Lemonides, chief investment officer at ValueWorks. When President Obama came into office, the country was ready for a rebound from the depths of the Great Recession. By the end of Bush’s term, interest rates had already been slashed, the Fed was increasing its balance sheet with massive monetary injections into the economy and Congress had passed massive bailouts. By mid 2009, the U.S. had recovered from the financial crisis, setting the stage for the longest bull market in history over the following eight years. The lengthy period of expansion under Obama’s tenure was marked by a surge in technology innovation, earnings and reduction of interest rates that in turn caused the stock market to skyrocket to new highs.The United States was already eight years into the longest economic recovery in history when President Trump was elected. The market jumped right after he won the 2016 election, on hopes that a Republican president would lower taxes and ease business regulation. Trump obliged early on in his presidency. Despite Trump’s claims to the contrary, “by no stretch of the imagination has the market done the best in history,” says Stovall. Major developments like the U.S.-China trade war and the coronavirus pandemic have “been a lot for the market to handle.” With much of the country dealing with lockdowns amid rising coronavirus cases, the United States plunged into a recession in February 2020.Presidential portraits courtesy of the National Archives and Records AdministrationI am a New York-based reporter covering billionaires and their wealth for Forbes.

Vast pools of underutilized IoT data are left to grow stale in organizational silos.It’s little wonder, when one considers the numbers:Nearly 80 zettabytes? That’s 80,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. “We’re building IoT systems that take data from all these devices, and this data is classified as alerts,” or active signals, says Dave Wright, ServiceNow’s chief innovation officer. “The challenge then becomes: What do you do with all of these alerts?”There’s untapped value hidden within these massive data volumes, Wright believes—particularly when IoT data is integrated with a customer service management platform (CSM) using smart workflows. Device data can be analyzed to prioritize service calls, for example, add value to a customer contract, even predict and prevent costly equipment failures.“With the number of connected assets set to increase dramatically,” — an estimated 41.6 billion devices by 2025, according to research — “it’s important that we start to analyze and understand the business context of any given device,” Wright says. “In the world of connected assets, no one has really focused on this before.”Keep reading to learn how connected enterprises use smart workflows to analyze IoT data in real time — and deliver measurable ROI in customer service, field engineering and other mission-critical departments.At first glance, TAPCO may seem like an unlikely source of cutting-edge IoT innovation. Since 1956, the third-generation, family-owned company has been making traffic signs for customers in all 50 states. In fact TAPCO was an early, insightful adopter of IoT.Today, the Wisconsin-based company provides an impressive array of internet-enabled products, including radar-equipped speed limit signs; programmable traffic safety displays; pedestrian crosswalk systems; and Wrong-Way driver alerts, which automatically detect cars driving in the wrong direction.To make better use of these always-on streams of device data, TAPCO’s leadership partnered with ServiceNow to pilot Connected Operations, a new product that uses existing IoT signals for customer support and field service applications.Before Connected Operations, data collected from IoT devices was stored and indexed on their own network and servers. ServiceNow saw opportunities to connect these signals to Customer Service Management (CSM) and Field Service Management (FSM), yielding greater automation and efficiency.Consider the chain of events following an equipment failure. When the solar panel on a speed limit sign fails, for example, a signal is sent to the service center. Before Connected Operations. A human being identified this particular sign and searched through customer records, asking: Is this item under warranty? Does the client have a service contract? How should this ticket be prioritized?Only then is a field service engineer dispatched.Thanks to Connected Operations, much of this process has been automated. Now, a device’s fail signal triggers an automatic search of TAPCO’s equipment records, and all pertinent information is delivered directly to customer service and the remote operations center simultaneously.Now, service decisions are made more quickly and accurately. Downtime is reduced and repairs can cost less. In some cases, issues are resolved even before the customer is aware of the problem.The trial program—currently deployed on TAPCO’s Wrong-Way driver alerts systems—brought greater capabilities to both customer service and field service by creating new, smart workflows that seamlessly pass data and analysis between once-separate departments.“The power it gives us is incredible,” says Jason Anderson, TAPCO’s IT director and member of the executive team.“For us, there was a lot of opportunity to move to a digital workflow,” says Anderson. “Not having to jump back and forth between multiple systems, not having to look up contracts over on this file server, not having to look up the customer contact,” he adds. “All that information is right here, gathered when the alert arrives.”This, says Anderson, has allowed TAPCO to continue serving long-time clients—many relationships go back decades—with cutting-edge, data-driven products featuring greater uptime, lower lifetime costs and greater overall customer satisfaction.TAPCO’s customers are also empowered. Working on a single integrated platform, they can now submit service requests, check a work order status and track new equipment orders. Thanks to these newly unlocked IoT data sources, these benefits are realized in near-real time.“Having a seamless, end-to-end workflow…is a huge efficiency gain for us and our customers,” Anderson says. “Now, we’re making decisions based on real data, instead of gut feelings.”As TAPCO’s experience demonstrates, it’s an exciting time to build more fully connected enterprises that use IoT-based data sources to improve the customer service experience. But this is just the beginning, says ServiceNow’s Dave Wright, who offers three examples of what’s coming across industries in the near future.The Internet of Things has come a long way since the term was first coined in 1999, then popularized in the ‘00s. Tens of billions of devices are already online, and billions more are expected to connect in the next few years.As to the question of what we can do with so much data, Dave Wright is excited to see what comes next — particularly when the use cases are essential to public health .“We've had other companies ask about monitoring wind speeds to decide whether they should shut down amusement park rides,” Wright says. “The level of importance being put on data is very interesting, especially when it might have life-or-death consequences.”ServiceNow is making the world of work, work better for people.

Bond funds, including those that specialize in debt securities issued by state and local governments, saw inflows of $17.7 billion over the same week. Hybrid funds, which invest in both stocks ad bonds, saw outflows of $1.6 billion in the five day period.It is normal for fund sectors to see inflows and outflows as sentiment in the market changes from week to week.However, such consistent outflows could be a contrary indicator of future good performance for commodities. In other words, consistent selling could be a precursor to a jump in performance for the category.That would certainly make sense based on the idea that the economy is likely to get back on a solid footing with three candidates for a COVID-19 vaccine showing promising results from late stage clinical trials.When a vaccine is approved and goes into mass production we can expect the economy to start operating nearer to full capacity and consuming lots of commodities. At that point the price of these raw materials will likely rise and the funds will likely see their unit value increase.Simon Constable | Author | Broadcaster | Journalist | Commentator | Speaker.

[+]The recent fall in gold prices might not be over and investors should wait until the market stabilizes before buying the precious metal, experts say.One troy ounce of gold bullion would recently fetch $1,811 down more than 12% from the all time high above $2,063 on August 6, according to data from Bloomberg. The SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) GLD -1% exchange-traded fund, which holds bars of solid bullion, followed a similar path in the market.But that drop in price might not be over in the short term, says a recent report from New York-based commodities consulting company CPM Group. “[...] a decline to $1,650 should not be ruled out,” if the price of metal falls below a key level of $1,750, the report states, and explains that this downward bias “seems set to continue in the short term.”The reason that gold hasn’t been doing well is multifaceted. First there that there is steady news on the progress of developing a vaccine. Already three large pharmaceutical companies, Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca, have reported high levels of efficacy from late stage clinical trials for potential vaccines. This good news has investors anticipating a full economy recovery with the vaccine allowing normalcy to return sooner rather than later.In addition, investors seem happy that the U.S. election is now over and that policies from the Biden Administration will likely be centrist. In other words, extreme policies that would likely hurt big business do not seem to be on the agenda.These two things will likely continue to have many investors favoring stocks over gold, at least for a while. Or put another way, gold buying won’t be top of mind for many investors over the immediate future.The CPM report warns investors to wait until the market stops falling before buying gold bullion. “It is recommended that investors stand aside until prices stabilize,” the report states.When that happens CPM does see a bullish future for the price of gold over the medium to long term.Simon Constable | Author | Broadcaster | Journalist | Commentator | Speaker.

But this news gets even better when you start to peel back the layers of the GDP equation to see what was driving the growth.The latest revision of GDPNow, the Atlanta-Fed’s real time estimate of economic growth, shows that the inflation-adjusted growth in investment by companies almost doubled since earlier in the month.Investment growth is now running at 46.7% versus 28.4%, according to the latest GDPNow estimate.While investment isn’t the largest component of U.S. GDP it is probably the most important. That’s because companies don’t have to invest anything in the economy. They could hold onto their cash and invest it elsewhere.The fact that not only is private investment growing but is accelerating, should show that private businesses are optimistic for the future of their U.S. economy. If they were not optimistic they wouldn’t be increasing the amount of cash invested.More investment means that the U.S. economy should be more efficient and that extra efficiency should, in-time, create jobs.The data also confirm what the stock market has been telling us lately.

[+]The COVID-19 pandemic continues to dog local labor markets in the U.S. And that’s why the government needs to step in with another round of fiscal stimulus or risk derailing the jobs recovery, according to a recent report from Deutsche Bank (DB).“Early evidence suggests that deteriorating Covid-19 trends are a key driver,” of a worsening jobs market, the report states. “Increases in initial claims seem to be concentrated in states that have recently been severely hit by Covid and, as a result, have begun to lock down again.”Put simply, where there is a significant jump in virus infections there have been higher new claims for unemployment insurance than where the infection rates has remained steady.The report notes that the states with the five largest increases in new claims, in descending order are llinois, Michigan, Washington, California, and Minnesota. Its also notable that those states have started reintroducing “restrictions on businesses or have issued stay-at-home orders,” the report states.That should be worrying for anyone who cares about the growth of the economy. The DB report puts it bluntly: “around 95% of GDP comes from counties with worsening Covid trends.”It is because of this clear linkage between the viral outbreaks and the rising dole queue claims that the DB report says that new government spending is needed quickly. If that doesn’t happen then the recovery in the jobs market may stall or even reverse the report states.“These developments are worrying in the context of the ongoing gridlock in Washington around further fiscal stimulus,” the report states. It notes that the initial stimulus was designed to keep workers and employers together and stop a flood of job seekers hitting the market.In that respect the first round of stimulus seemed to help, but the lack of progress in Congress on a second round means that a deluge of layoffs may manifest.Such a reversal could be a disaster for the economy which relies heavily on household spending. Historically, around two thirds of the economy comes from consumers, with government spending, investment and international trade making up the rest.If Congress fails to act swiftly, and unemployment jumps back, then expect investors to run for cover.

One of these is the Santa Rally. This can make December a positive month for investors. Might we see this in 2020?Researchers generally find December to be among the better months for stock market performance. Generally the November-May period tending to deliver better returns than the summer months. Some researchers believe that substantially all the gains for stocks over time occur during this period. In fact, for the Indian stock market December may be the best month.However, most of the research on monthly trends in the stock market finds the ‘January effect’, rather than December, to be the real king of seasonal trends. Where value stocks in particular can see generally good returns during early January. Compared to January, the evidence for a strong December is less robust.So what we may find, as research has suggested, is that we are currently in a better period of the year for stocks, generally speaking, and that stocks exhibit a ‘turn-of-the-month’ effect. This means that December may deliver better than average returns, but the bulk of this may be concentrated during the first few days and the last few days of the month. In part, the later December positive trend may be due to a holiday effect in the market, where the market can rally during stock market holidays and the markets are closed on both Christmas Day and New Year’s Day.So now may be a reasonably positive time to invest based on seasonal trends, but a Santa rally is perhaps not the best way to describe it, because we are in a period of expected slightly higher market performance that spans beyond December alone.That said, though these trends have delivered returns historically, there is no guarantee that investors will see gains in any particular year. For example, investors may make money, but still lose in 4 years out of 10. Also, given the current relatively high degree of uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of the Covid-19 and the responses to it, it is quite possible that seasonal factors may be drowned out by positive or negative news related to Covid-19 or other issues.Furthermore, market valuations are currently elevated. The market is currently on a Shiller PE of 33x earnings when averaged over the past 10 years. We’ve only seen higher during the dot com bubble of the 2000s. In contrast, the long-term average for this valuation metric is around 16x. This does not bode well for long-term returns. However, valuation trends such as this can take years to play out. Also, some argue that low inflation and low interest rates support high stock valuations. That may be true, provided the environment lasts, unfortunately historically it has not.So, December may prove to be positive for investors, but if you are looking for monthly trends in the stock market, you will find more evidence of it in January than December.Simon is the author of Digital Wealth and Strategic Project Portfolio Management.

This is the consistent story that we keep hearing over the past few years. Except for the practitioners and some geeks, most people are not aware of the nuances of ML. ML is definitely related to Artificial Intelligence. Whether it is a pure subset or a closely related area depends on who you ask. The dream of general Artificial Intelligence to have machines solve previously unseen problems in all domains using cognitive skills had turned into AI winter as those approaches did not yield results for more than forty or fifty years. The resurgence of ML turned the field around. ML became tractable as the horsepower of computers increased and much more data about different domains became available to train models. ML turned the focus away from trying to model the whole world using data and symbolic logic to make predictions. Instead ML relied on statistical methods and limiting the field of prediction as discussed below.There are three separate approaches in ML; one is called supervised learning, the second semi-supervised learning and the third is unsupervised learning. Deep learning is characterized by multiple layers of such methods. The success of ML comes from the ability of models to trained through large amounts of data in a particular domain called training sets to make predictions. In any ML pipeline a number of candidate models are trained using data. At the end of the training, an essential of amount of basic structure of the domain are encoded in the model. This allows for the ML model to generalize to create predictions in the real world. For example, a large number of cat videos and non-cat videos can be fed into the model to train the model to recognize cat videos. At the end of the training a certain amount of cat-videoness is encoded in successful models.ML is used in many familiar systems; including movie recommendations based on viewing data, market basket analysis which suggest new products based on the current contents of shopping carts. Facial recognition, skin cancer prediction from clinical images, identifying retinal neuropathy from retinal scans, predictions of cancer from MRI scans are all in the domain of ML. Of course recommender systems for movies and predicting skin cancer or the beginnings of retinal neuropathy and blindness are vastly different in scope and importance.Showing wildly varied prediction of trajectory of Infections from an underspecified epidemiological ... [+]The key idea after this training is to use an independent and identically distributed (iid) evaluation procedure using data drawn from the training distribution which it has not yet encountered. This evaluation is used to choose the candidate for deployment in the real world. Many candidates can perform similarly during this phase, even though there are subtle differences between them due to the starting assumptions, number of runs, data that they trained on etc.Ideally the iid evaluation predicts the expected performance of the model. This helps separate the wheat from the chaff. The duds from the iid-optimal models. That there would be some structural misalignment between the training sets and the real world is obvious. The real world is messy, chaotic, images are blurry, the operators are not trained to capture pristine images, there are equipment breakdowns. All predictors deemed equivalent at the evaluation phase should have should have shown similar defects in the real world. A paper written by three principals and backed by fifty researchers all from google GOOG +1.2%, probes this theory to explain many high profile failures of ML models in the real world. The paper notes that all predictors that performed similarly during the evaluation phase did not perform equally in the real world. Uh oh, this means that the duds and the good performers could not be distinguished at the end of the pipeline. This paper is a sledgehammer taken to the process of choosing a predictor and the current construction of an ML pipeline.The paper identifies the root cause of this behavior as underspecification in ML pipelines. Underspecification is a well understood and well documented phenomenon in ML, it arises due to the presence of more unknowns than independent linear equations. Underspecification is a deliberate tactic to reach the choice faster. The first claim is that underspecification in ML pipelines is a key obstacle to reliably training models that behave as expected in deployment. The second claim is that underspecification is ubiquitous in modern applications of ML, and has substantial practical implications. There is no easy cure for the underspecification. Further all deployed ML predictors using the old pipeline are suspect.The solution is to be aware of the perils of underspecification and choose multiple predictors, and then subject them to stress tests and choose the best performer; in other words, expand the testing regime. All this points to the need for better quality data to be used in both the training and evaluation set, which brings us to the use of blockchains and smart contracts to implement healthcare systems. With access to higher quality and varied training data may reduce underspecification and hence create a pathway to better ML models, faster.I am the founder of dlt.nyc.

88,['https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadepfau/2020/11/25/risk-pooling-through-life-insurance/'],['Risk Pooling Through Life Insurance'],"['Thus far, the risk pooling discussion has focused on annuities. Another form of risk pooling for longevity is available through life insurance, and this chapter* explores the ways that life insurance can potentially be incorporated into lifetime financial planning. This discussion is mostly about whole life insurance in comparison to term life insurance, but other forms of permanent insurance will be discussed briefly at the end of the chapter*.Whole life insurance can provide a foundation to allow the household to spend more and still be able to provide a bequest, or to increase spending even further by using the cash value as a volatility buffer for the investment portfolio. Whole life insurance can provide a source of funds to support legacy, liquidity, and even long-term care if a rider is added for that purpose. With life insurance playing this role, the retiree may also feel more comfortable using an annuity with lifetime spending protection, which provides the benefits of risk pooling to meet a retirement spending goal using a smaller asset base.As well, when viewed as an investment, whole life insurance can provide an attractive alternative to holding bonds in an investment portfolio. Premiums are invested in the insurance company’s general account, which, as we have discussed, can provide advantages for fixed-income investments relative to what a household can obtain on its own. Life insurance also provides tax deferral for its cash value, and when properly structured, the cash value can be accessed on a tax-free basis during life (meaning that the cash value of life insurance behaves similarly to a Roth IRA). The death benefit is also provided on a tax-free basis. Because of limits on how much that can be invested into tax-deferred retirement plans, this aspect of life insurance can provide a way to obtain more tax-deferral for savings after exceeding other limits.That being said, the traditional purpose of life insurance is to provide a death benefit to help support surviving family members or a family business in the event of the policyholder’s untimely death. In this context, the amount of life insurance one seeks to hold is what dependents would need to sustain their lifestyle or meet other obligations in the absence of the policyholder being able to contribute to the family through wages or other caretaking. As noted, life insurance can play other roles in a retirement income plan as well. This chapter* investigates life insurance from the broader retirement income perspective.Just as annuities with income guarantees use actuarial science and risk pooling to support a spending level consistent with living to life expectancy, life insurance is also based on actuarial science and provides mortality credits and risk pooling. Life insurance works as the counterpart to lifetime income. While lifetime income protections reduce the cost of funding a long life, life insurance provides higher realized returns to a household in the event of a shorter life. These two contrasting uses of risk pooling can work together effectively in lifetime financial planning.GETTYDuring the preretirement period, human capital is an important asset for households. Human capital is the present value of all the wages individuals expect to earn during the remainder of their working years. For those with families or other fixed obligations that depend on receiving human capital in the form of those future wages, the life insurance death benefit can serve as a replacement for lost wages in the event of an early death during the working years. We usually think of life insurance as a tool for replacing lost income, but even a homemaker who does not earn wages may consider life insurance to help the household that would then have to pay for more services related to childcare and household management in the event of the homemaker’s death.For this basic human capital replacement framework, one generally does not associate a need for life insurance after retirement begins. The value of human capital approaches zero as the working years end, though those continuing with part-time work in retirement may still be reliant on and need protection for their human capital. Once fully retired, the household subsequently funds lifestyle with assets accumulated during the working years. They have converted their human capital into financial assets.Term life insurance supports the role of human capital replacement. With term life insurance, one purchases a contract to receive a death benefit should death occur within a certain number of years or by a certain age. The term could be chosen to end once family needs or other financial obligations no longer depend on the future earnings of the worker. A mantra of “buy term and invest the difference” developed in the investing world as the way to approach the life insurance decision. Because the death benefit is temporary with term life insurance, and it also does not include a savings component, term life premiums will be smaller than with other forms of life insurance. For a given pool of funds, this affords a greater remaining amount to be invested after life insurance obligations are met, as long as the individual follows through and invests those additional dollars not spent on life insurance premiums.For lifetime financial planning, is it really best to pay the smallest amount possible for life insurance in order to invest as much as possible in the financial markets? This chapter* puts the concept of “buy term and invest the difference” to the test by investigating whether there are better ways to approach life insurance from the context of comprehensive lifetime financial and retirement income planning. The focus of this chapter* is about whether other forms of permanent life insurance should be considered by the household as part of a longer-term retirement strategy that can be set into motion during the accumulation phase. Even though term insurance premiums are lower, this type of life insurance may not always provide the best value in the context of financial planning outcomes related to getting the most spending power and legacy from the available asset base.I will focus particularly on whole life insurance as an alternative to term insurance. For life insurance, there are natural parallels between different types of insurance products and different types of annuities. Whole life insurance corresponds most closely to income annuities. For both, premiums enter the insurance company’s general account and the insurance company invests those premiums with a heavy focus on fixed-income assets and asset-liability matching. Whole life insurance consists of a death benefit and a cash value savings component. A difference between whole life insurance and income annuities is that whole life policies are frequently participating policies that can earn dividends when realized outcomes fair better than the insurance company’s conservative pricing projections, while participating income annuities are still relatively rare. Unlike income annuities, whole life insurance is underwritten, and different pricing is available based on health classification.Looking for more information?

Here are some reasons not to cancel student loans.Here’s what you need to know—and what it means for your student loans.Will your student loans get cancelled? Some members of Congress and President-Elect Joe Biden have proposed to cancel student loans. Among the many proposals for student loan forgiveness, the most recent has gained some traction: a plan to cancel up to $10,000 of student loans. According to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), there are several reasons to cancel student loans. For example, student loan forgiveness could help a generation of borrowers start their lives debt-free. The latest student loan debt statistics show that 45 million borrowers collectively owe more than $1.6 trillion in student loan debt. This can help student loan borrowers get married sooner, start a family, buy a home and save for retirement. Warren also says that cancelling student loans can reduce social and racial disparities.As Congress, the president and policy experts debate the future of student loans, it’s important to understand both sides of the “cancel student loans” issue. What are the arguments against cancelling student loans?Here are 5 reasons not to cancel student loans:There are approximately 250 million adults in the U.S. Of this total, only 45 million are student loan borrowers. While that number is significant, it’s less than 20% of the total adult population. Forgiving student loan debt certainly would benefit these individuals. However, more than 200 million adult Americans no longer have, or never had, student loan debt. Is it fair to cancel student loans for this sub-section of the population, while the majority of the population (who may face other, important financial challenges) do not receive commensurate financial support? Many federal taxpayers may not want to subsidize the cost of student loan debt cancellation, which could cost nearly $400 billion, while they receive no financial benefit.Who benefits from student loan forgiveness? Graduate school debt accounts for more than 40% of all outstanding student loan debt. This includes student loans for medical school, dental school, business school and law school. While each of those degrees can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in tuition, student loan borrowers who hold these degrees tend to earn significantly higher income. This is not to say that some borrowers with graduate degrees do not struggle with student loan repayment. Many do, and not all student loan borrowers with graduate degrees earn significant income. That said, cancelling student loans for all student loan borrowers would mean that high-income borrowers receive student loan forgiveness, even if they can afford their student loan payments. Therefore, student loan forgiveness would not be targeted optimally to student loan borrowers with low income, who didn’t attend college or who are unemployed, for example. The Heroes Act—the $3 trillion stimulus plan House Democrats passed earlier this year—included a provision to cancel $10,000 of student loans for borrowers who are “struggling economically.” If legislators proceed to cancel student loans, they may want to consider imposing an income limit or tying student loan forgiveness to unemployment or other financial struggles as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic or the economy, for example.Some have argued that student loan forgiveness is smart policy to stimulate the economy. However, research shows that stimulus checks and unemployment benefits are better ways to stimulate the economy. For example, the Committee For A Responsible Federal Budget says that cancelling $1.6 trillion of student loan debt would produce only $90 billion in available cash to spend in 2021 and only $450 billion over the next 5 years. Why? The reason is that $10,000 of student loan forgiveness does not equate to giving every borrower $10,000 in cash. Rather, with student loan debt cancellation, borrowers save an amount of cash equal to their principal and interest payments, which could result in several hundred dollars in savings per month, on average, for example. If Congress wants to stimulate the economy, Congress would be better off giving stimulus checks to every American and encouraging them to spend.If there is student loan cancellation, it would benefit only borrowers who hold student loans on the day student loans would be cancelled. That means if you paid off student loans in full the day before, you would be out of luck. Many student loan borrowers paid off student loans by working multiple jobs, foregoing buying a home or delaying other important life decisions. Will these borrowers who also may have struggled receive any commensurate compensation? Congress could consider a reasonable look-back period to account for student loan borrowers who paid off student loans during a specific period prior to any potential student loan cancellation.Cancelling student loans could provide some immediate relief to current student loan borrowers. However, the day after student loans are cancelled, students will continue to borrow tens of thousands of dollars to fund their education. While a college or graduate degree generally leads to higher earnings, student loan debt cancellation doesn’t address the underlying issue: the cost of higher education. Congress may be more impactful by focusing on ways to make college and graduate school more affordable.What’s the best way to pay off student loans? As Congress debates the merits of student loan forgiveness, make sure you act to pay off student loans. There’s no guarantee if or when Congress may cancel student loans.
