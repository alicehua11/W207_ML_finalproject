http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/amazon-instant-video-browser/,Amazon's Streaming Video Library Now a Little Easier to Navigate,"Having trouble finding something to watch on Amazon Instant Video? The retailer launched Monday an experimental browsing tool that lets users discover movies and TV shows based on their genre preferences or simply the mood they're in. Movies and shows are divided up into categories, some of which bear the names of genres (i.e., ""Comedy"" and ""Mystery/Thriller""), and others which are labeled by mood, such as ""Feel-Good"" and ""Exciting."" Users can toggle between TV shows and movies, and apply filters to show only videos that are available for free viewing to Prime subscribers, or ones that bear G or PG ratings. It's pretty basic, but it sure beats the haphazard organization of Amazon's current Instant Video page, which mixes rows of new releases with bestsellers and personal recommendations. The move is the latest in a series of investment's Amazon is making in its streaming video platform. Last week, the company inked a licensing agreement with A+E Networks to bring past seasons of shows from A&E, History, Lifetime and Bio to its streaming library — shows, it should be noted, that Netflix subscribers lost access to in the fall. Amazon claims its streaming Prime catalog now numbers more than 33,000, double what it was a year ago. Screenshot courtesy of Amazon.com "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/ap-samsung-sponsored-tweets/,AP's Twitter to Begin Displaying Sponsored Tweets,"The Associated Press is the latest news organization to experiment with trying to make money from Twitter by using its feed to advertise for other companies.  The AP announced Monday that it will share sponsored tweets from Samsung throughout this week for the International CES taking place in Las Vegas. The news service will let Samsung post two tweets per day to the AP's Twitter account, which has more than 1.5 million users, and each of these tweets will be labeled ""SPONSORED TWEETS."" This marks the first time that the AP has sold advertising on its Twitter feed, and the company says it spent months developing guidelines to pave the way for this and other new media business models.  For this particular promotion, Samsung will provide the sponsored tweets and non-editorial staff at the AP will handle the publishing side. In this way, the company hopes to maintain a clear dividing line between its editorial and advertising operations on Twitter. ""We are thrilled to be taking this next step in social media,"" said Lou Ferrara, the AP managing editor overseeing its social media efforts, in a statement. ""As an industry, we must be looking for new ways to develop revenues while providing good experiences for advertisers and consumers. At the same time, advertisers and audiences expect AP to do that without compromising its core mission of breaking news.""  Other publishers have dabbled in Twitter ads, including The Atlantic, National Journal, The Times-Picayune and BreakingNews.com. Image courtesy of Flickr, nan palmero "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/apple-40-billion-app-downloads/,Apple's App Store Passes 40 Billion Downloads,"It looks like 2012 was a pretty good year for Apple's App Store. Apple announced Monday that the App Store has now passed 40 billion downloads since launching in 2008, with nearly 20 billion apps downloaded in 2012. The company had a particularly strong holiday season, with 2 billion app downloads in December alone. The App Store hit the 25 billion mark in March and passed 35 billion in October.  â€œIt has been an incredible year for the iOS developer community,â€ said Eddy Cue, Appleâ€™s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, in a statement. â€œDevelopers have made over $7 billion on the App Store, and we continue to invest in providing them with the best ecosystem so they can create the most innovative apps in the world.â€ Just as importantly, the company revealed that there are now more than 500 million active accounts in the App Store, showing the growth of Apple's user base.  In total, there are now 775,000 apps in Apple's App Store, with more than 300,000 apps specifically designed for iPad. That's up from 700,000 total apps in October, with about 250,000 iPad-specific apps at the time. Image courtesy of Cristiano Betta "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/astronaut-notre-dame-bcs/,This Astronaut Is Rooting for Notre Dame Tonight,"When it comes to college football, NASA astronaut Kevin Ford is Irish through and through. Ford will be rooting for Notre Dame all the way from space during the BCS Championship game against Alabama tonight. Ford is currently living on the International Space Station, where he commands a six-man team, but tonight his heart will be with Notre Dame —his alma mater —when the team faces off with Alabama's Crimson Tide in Miami. ""The team's played great,"" Ford said in a recent interview with Notre Dame officials on NASA TV. ""Obviously the defense is very special, and the offense is just really clicking. I'm looking forward to a great game on the seventh of January.""  Ford has been living on the space station since October, when he blasted off aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket. He took charge of the space station's Expedition 34 crew a month later and will return to Earth in March. He is a native of Montpelier, Ind., and is a retired colonel in the U.S. Air Force. Ford said he tried to keep up with Notre Dame's games while on his current spaceflight, but he admitted the timing of the games is a challenge. The space station runs on Greenwich Mean Time, so many of the football games last well into the wee hours of the morning for Ford.  SEE ALSO: Tour the Space Station (Video)
 For tonight's championship game, though, Ford said he asked Mission Control for some post-game recovery time. That way, he can watch most of the game live during the overnight hours. Astronauts can watch live television via a satellite communications system, Ford said. ""It's normally used for science data, but on weekends, if it's free, they'll let us get a little bit of TV,"" Ford added. ""I've been able to follow the team and see a lot of the games."" The astronaut even has his favorite Notre Dame garb on the space station to support the team. During his interview, he pulled off his Expedition 34 sweatshirt to reveal a ""Play Like a Champion Today"" t-shirt just for the team. He also has a sign that reads ""Explore Like a Champion Today"" mounted over one of the space station's hatches, much like the iconic sign Notre Dame players touch on the way to the field at their home stadium. But before Ford ever signed up for NASA's astronaut corps, he was a student at Notre Dame. He studied aerospace engineering and graduated with a bachelors of science degree in 1982. He even learned Russian along the way, something that happened to come in useful recently. ""I took a Russian class at Notre Dame,"" Ford said. ""Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would fly someday in a Russian spacecraft with two cosmonauts, speaking only Russian."" Photos courtesy of NASA TV

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/beewi-smart-toys/,BeeWi's Smart Toys Put Your Smartphone in Control," LAS VEGAS — RC toys have traded in their bulky remote controls for the gadget in your pocket. Take the new line of smart toys from BeeWi, introduced this week at CES 2013. The company's new fighting helicopters, soccer-playing robots and four-wheelers all rely on iOS and Android devices for control. Like another iPad-controlled device, Parrot's popular AR.Drone, the big-wheeled ScaraBee ($149.99) lets you steer via simple on-iPad (or iPhone) controls — it connects via ad-hoc Wi-Fi — and includes a camera so you can see what the toy sees. Unlike the Drone, ScaraBee only records up to one minute of VGA video. It does drive for 15 minutes on a charge. I took the bot for a quick test drive and found the controls simple, though not entirely intuitive. I assume I'd get better with practice. The company also introduced TankBee, which connects to mobile devices via Bluetooth.  BeeWi's RC helicopters, also controlled by iOS and Android devices, do have cameras, but only the infrared sort, which they use to see other helicopters and stationary targets — the latter of which can ""shoot"" back. Five hits and the $119 StingBee slowly loses altitude until it lands back on the ground. There's also a $69.99 version that cannot shoot or read infrared beams.  Perhaps the most entertaining new BeeWi toy is the little KickBee. Smaller than all the other robots, it comes with a tiny plastic ball. As with all the other BeeWi products, you can control it via a mobile device but, in this case, you'll want to make sure someone else also has one of the $54.99 robots so you can play a pickup game of soccer. Now imagine a field of these little guys, each one controlled by someone with a smartphone, working as teams to drive the rubber ball into a goal. Sounds like fun. The company is also unveiling a set of iOS and Android device controlled Mini Coopers and a Fiat 500 toy later this year. Company officials told me they're also quite close to Windows Phone 8 versions of their remote control apps. Images Courtesy of BeeWi and Mashable "

It was on display at the International CES where we got to take a look at the new device. Now, with the addition of some new accessories, it looks more like arm candy. Gwen Smith with BodyMedia says the face of the new sensor is smaller, about the size of an iPod nano, with an optional strap that has heart rate sensors in it. There are interchangeable faceplates to choose from as well so you literally dress your tracker to match your style. They've also added a black face and strap to appeal to a more masculine audience. The BodyMedia, like other fitness devices, lets you upload data right to its app or online software. It also integrates with other fitness apps like Runkeeper and My FitnessPal. There's no price for the new Core 2 monitor yet, but expect it to run between $119 and $149 when it launches. Powerful yet fun DIY robotics for adults and children.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/chuck-hagel-website/,Obama Defense Nominee Chuck Hagel Targeted by Smear Website,"Mere hours after President Barack Obama put forth Chuck Hagel as his choice for Secretary of Defense, a pro-Israel group launched a website with the goal of scuttling the nomination.  The website, ChuckHagel.com, was launched by the Emergency Committee for Israel, and claims that Hagel ""is not a responsible option"" for the cabinet position.  The Emergency Committee for Israel is described on its website as ""committed to mounting an active defense of the U.S.-Israel relationship by educating the public about the positions of political candidates on this important issue."" The interest group, led by right-wing commentator and Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, has already posted an anti-Hagel video to YouTube that knocks his stance on economic sanctions and military action against Iran.   Hagel, a former senator from Nebraska, has in previous comments said that military action against Iran would be ill-advised. He has been criticized by many conservatives and some liberals for those stances and for being, in their view, insufficiently supportive of Israel.  The brewing controversy over Hagel's nomination is leading some analysts to expect less than smooth sailing when the Senate votes on his nomination. The committee also plans to buy ad placements on Google that will appear when users search for ""Chuck Hagel,"" according to Yahoo.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/cosmic-events-doomsday/,3 Cosmic Events That Will Spark Doomsday Rumors,"Take a deep breath; Dec 21, 2012 is behind us. The Mayan calendar end-of-world debacle is over: zip, zilch, gone! The silliness, anxiety and paranoia leading up to the predicted end of times was so bad that on Dec. 21st — the appointed doomsday — a worried citizen left a message on my office phone that accused me of skipping town to escape Armageddon. SEE ALSO: Top 5 Plans to Ensure the Continuity of our Species If history is any example, the next cosmic doomsday prediction is always right around the corner. The Mayan blowout was just the latest in many centuries of bad calls by prognosticators who have the audacity to think they can divine the End of Everything. So, to be a little preemptive, let's look at just three cosmic events that might start another pop culture panic. Thankfully these aren't born out of mythology, psychics and misinterpreted archeoastronomy. They are real events that will inevitably be embellished by the imaginations of modern day soothsayers.  Last September, the International Scientific Optical Network (ISON) near Kislovodsk, Russia, discovered comet C/2012 S1 (ISON). Though its closest approach to Earth is a year away, the celestial visitor is already billed as the ""comet of the century."" That's because it may be a first-time visitor to the solar system that will warm and then erupt with a lot of outgassing from pristine ices. SEE ALSO: New Comet Discovered — Will It Be Spectacular? On Nov. 28, 2013, the comet will skim above the sun's surface at a distance slightly greater than the separation of the Earth and moon. Not doubt there will be pseudoscience predictions of the comet wreaking havoc by raising tides on the sun. The exact opposite will be the case. The sun's tidal pull could tear apart the comet into small pieces, as has been the case for previous sungrazer-class comets. Comet ISON is due to pass within 37 million miles of Earth in January 2014. You can expect to see all types of outrageous claims that the object's feeble gravity will yank on Earth to trigger volcanoes and earthquakes. Comet ISON has been compared with the Great Comet of 1680 (in above illustration) which, according to contemporary accounts, caused New Yorkers to be ""overcome with terror at a sight in the heavens such as has seldom greeted human eyes."" A day of fasting and humiliation was set-aside in order that ""the wrath of God might be assuaged."" Likewise, soothsayers will quickly note that the comet will be at it brightest one month before Christmas 2013. ""This comet, if it lives up to its billing, certainly could point to the glorious soon coming of the Lord Jesus Christ from heaven!"" predicts one religious website. The fact that the comet is anticipated to get as bright as the moon will only fuel religious and mystical speculation about its timing and significance as an omen. Chill out folks, it's just another 4-billion-year-old primeval chunk of ice from the solar system's deep freeze, the Oort cloud.  NASA keeps cataloging more Earth-threatening asteroids every year. But the asteroid Apophis, named after the Egyptian spirit of evil and destruction, is legendary because it will be a record-breaker. On April, Friday the 13th of 2029 Apophis will skim below the orbits of communication satellites and briefly be a naked-eye object scooting over the mid-Atlantic ocean. SEE ALSO: Top 10 Ways to Stop an Asteroid Earth's gravity will deflect the comet's trajectory. The worst-case scenario is that the chances of it striking Earth on its return on April 13, 2036 will increase to 1 in 5,500. Apophis is the length of over three football fields. It packs enough kinetic energy to wipe out 10 million people with the power of 100,000 Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs. Even in this worst-case scenario, a direct hit would not obliterate all life on the planet. But it certainly would not be a good day for the human race. People will get very squeamish over the possibility of Apophisgeddon despite the best low-probability collision estimate from astronomers. Parallels no doubt will be drawn to Biblical prophecy. This is especially true because the potentially destructive path of the asteroid crosses Middle East. South America and the west coast of Africa are also along the ground track. Congress might even debate if steps should be taken to deflect the asteroid. But given that so many legislators are tone-deaf to global warming, don't expect any preemptive actions to be funded.  Like clockwork so-called planetary grand alignments have taken place in 1962, 1982 and 2000. This does not mean that the planets line up like pearls on a string. But they sort of gang up on one side of the sun within an angle of roughly 10 to 30 degrees — so the definition is a but mushy. The uneventful year 1128 A.D. saw one of the tightest planetary alignments. The 1982 doomsday best-seller The Jupiter Effect spelled out an improbable chain of events that would be triggered by the planets' tug-of-war with the sun: Tides raised on the sun's surface would increase sunspot activity, build up the solar wind that would effect Earth's weather, and subsequently, Earth's spin rate, which would then trigger earthquakes. SEE ALSO: No Doomsday! The Quick Reference Guide No geological disasters happened in 1982 short of a 6.0 magnitude earthquake that killed 1,500 people in Dhamar, northern Yemen. In fact the celestial alignment allowed for NASA to pull off the Voyager 2 ""grand tour"" of the four outer gas giant planets from 1979 to 1989. Jupiter contains more mass than all the other planets combined, and yet it is still less than 1% of the sun's mass. Therefore Jupiter's influence on the sun is inconsequential. Alien astronomers could measure Jupiter's gravitational tug as an insignificant 270 mile-per-hour cyclic change in the sun's radial velocity over the planet's 12-year orbital period. Only if Jupiter was moved so close to the sun that its orbital period was measured in days, would some serious tidal effects be seen. This is observed with so-called ""hot Jupiters,"" the exoplanet WASP-18 being the most extreme case. Running an ephemeris forward in time, with the ease of throttling H.G. Wells' time machine, the next closest thing to a grand alignment comes in 2163 (shown above). Unless we have bombed ourselves back to pre-Columbian society by then, people in 2163 will be too science savvy to give this any thought. They will be bemused by historical accounts of the feared Jupiter Effect by their science-illiterate ancestors. What's ironic is that any casual surfing of the Internet shows that a lot of people are preoccupied with doom and gloom based on mythology, psychics and patently flaky ideas. The real Earth-threats, such as global warming, seem to be too easily shrugged off as lacking solid scientific evidence. Go figure. Images courtesy of NASA; Russell Schweickart / B612 Foundation

For about $130, Crayon Creatures will create bespoke figurines based on your child's drawings. Just launched last week, the company has already gained the attention of enthused parents worldwide. Crayon Creatures will take any 2D drawing, model it on a software and produce it using a 3D printer. As each figurine is personalized, the whole process can take up to three weeks start to finish.  The idea behind Crayon Creatures reminds us of Child's Own Studio, where a kid's hand-drawn character is made into a stuffed toy.  As the cost of 3D printers continues to drop, a lot of other similar concepts have popped up — and not just for children. As The Verge notes, a service called Printcraft lets Minecraft players turn their designs into 3D-printable files. Doodle3D is also another software that creates 3D versions of simple line drawings.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/earth-size-planets-milky-way/,There Are 17 Billion Earth-Size Alien Planets in Milky Way,"The Milky Way hosts at least 17 billion Earth-size alien planets, and probably many more, a new study reveals. Astronomers have determined that about 17% of stars in our galaxy harbor a roughly Earth-size exoplanet in a close orbit. Since there are 100 billion or so stars in the Milky Way, that works out to a minimum of 17 billion small, rocky alien worlds, or an Earth-size planet around one of every six stars. And there are probably many more such planets orbiting at greater distances from their stars, some of which may even be ""alien Earths"" capable of supporting life as we know it. Crunching the Numbers  The research team conducted an analysis of data collected by NASA's planet-hunting Kepler Space Telescope. Kepler detects alien worlds by noting the telltale dips in brightness caused when planets cross the face of — or transit — their parent stars from the instrument's perspective. The telescope, which launched in March 2009, flagged more than 2,300 potential planets in its first 16 months of operation, more than 100 of which have been confirmed to date.  SEE ALSO: The Strangest Alien Planets (Gallery)
 The research team wanted to know how complete and accurate Kepler's survey has been — that is, what percentage of its finds are real, and how many planets is it likely missing? So they came up with a simulation that mimicked the telescope's work, finding that about 90% of its detections are probably the real deal. ""There is a list of astrophysical configurations that can mimic planet signals, but altogether, they can only account for one-tenth of the huge number of Kepler candidates,"" team member Francois Fressin, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA), said in a statement. ""All the other signals are bona-fide planets."" Fressin presented the results today at the annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Long Beach, Calif. The work has also been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal. Planets, Planets Everywhere Using information from both the actual and simulated Kepler surveys, the team calculated some estimates about how common different types of planets are thoughout the Milky Way. They determined, for example, that 17% of stars have a planet 0.8 to 1.25 times the size of Earth in tight orbits, with periods of 85 days or less. About 25% of stars have a so-called ""super-Earth"" (worlds 1.25 to 2 times as big as our own) in an orbit of 150 days or less — the same percentage that hosts a ""mini-Neptune"" (a planet 2 to 4 times Earth's size) with an orbital period up to 250 days. Big planets such as Saturn or Jupiter are far less common. Only 5% of stars harbor a gas giant with an orbital period of 400 days or less, researchers said. Overall, the team found that about 50% of all stars in the Milky Way have a planet the size of Earth or larger in a tight orbit. Further, stars don't have to be sun-like to host an Earth-size world. The team also determined that small and medium-size exoplanets are commonly found around red dwarfs as well, which are smaller and cooler than our star. ""Earths and super-Earths aren't picky,"" said co-author Guillermo Torres, also of the CfA. ""We're finding them in all kinds of neighborhoods."" Kepler generally requires three planetary transits to flag a potential alien world. Since more tightly orbiting planets transit more frequently, the telescope's early findings have been biased toward close-in worlds. But as Kepler continues to operate, it should find more and more planets farther from their host stars — including, perhaps, Earth-size worlds in Earthlike orbits. Image courtesy of C. Pulliam and D. Aguilar (CfA)

BONUS: Top Memes of 2012   Five years ago, three college girls on a Caribbean vacation got a serious case of the heebeejeebies when a stingray photobombed their “say cheese” moment. The hilarious photograph could have ended up as just a fond vacay memory if it weren’t for a friend, who shared the image on Reddit in September of this year. Paul Ryan may have lost his bid for vice president, but the Wisconsin congressman achieved something far greater: Internet fame. The hot-bodied politician inspired not one, but two memes in 2012.  The first, Paul Ryan Gosling, took inspiration from the Ryan Gosling “Hey, Girl” meme that caught fire in 2008. The Hey Girl, It’s Paul Ryan Tumblr made Ryan something of a small government sex symbol, while @PaulRyanGosling offered 140-character sarcasm on things like Medicare. Paul Ryan’s other meme-able moment of 2012 happened when TIME released workout photos of Ryan in October. He may look like an extra on “Saved By the Bell,” but you can’t deny his impressive physique. Zeddie Little was happily jogging along in the 2012 Cooper River Bridge Run in South Carolina, when a photographer snapped a shot of Little and his perfectly pearly teeth.  The photo of the dashing runner was posted to Reddit in April under the title “My friend calls him ‘Mr Ridiculously Photogenic Guy.’”  Ridiculously Photogenic Guy ended up charming the Internet enough to earn a spot in meme history, even if he did lose the race. Octogenarian Cecilia Gimenez attempted to restore a 19th century church fresco, but instead, her amateur painting skills turned Jesus into a cartoon version of himself.  A BBC Europe reporter described the finished piece as “a crayon sketch of a very hairy monkey in an ill-fitting tunic.” The botched fresco also drew comparisons to Rowlf the Dog and Brutus Buckeye. The bad makeover dropped jaws across the web over the summer, especially after Gimenez demanded payment for her shoddy paint job. The Photoshopping wizards of the Internet put the Potato Jesus face on other famous works of art.  The sourpuss mug of a cat named Tardar Sauce scratched the Internet with delight in September. A Reddit user shared a photo of the grouchy-faced feline and the Grumpy Cat meme began spreading its crabbiness around the web. Grumpy Cat (and her brother, Pokey) now have their own website, which posts a “Daily Grump” and sells merchandise like t-shirts and Scrooge-like holiday cards.  Clint Eastwood’s somewhat surprise appearance at the GOP Convention had Republicans excited for Dirty Harry badassness. Instead, they got 10 minutes of the Hollywood legend talking to an empty chair.  The bizarre appearance spawned both the @InvisibleObama Twitter account and the Eastwooding photo fad, in which people shared images of empty chairs. Sorry, couches, but Eastwood crowned chairs the hottest furniture of 2012. An intense-eyed 20-something named Laina scared the crap out of men everywhere when her face first went viral as an advice animal macro this summer. The Overly Attached Girlfriend meme featured a screengrab from a parody Justin Bieber fan video created by Laina. The stalkerish lyrics and potent stare made Overly Attached Girlfriend the most loveable clingy lady friend in Internet history. In 2012, dog humiliation caught on like fleas at the dog park. Tumblr Dogshaming featured photos of pooches wearing signs that spelled out their transgressions — for the whole Internet to see. Dog owners with poop scoot marks on carpet or drawers filled with chewed up panties punish their furry friends with web-blasted embarrassment.   The 2012 presidential election was brought to you by the letter B. Mitt Romney’s debate meme-lights included references to Big Bird, Binders Full of Women, and Horses and Bayonets.  The Triple B threat ensured that election season had plenty of laughs to help distract from the real (and boring) issues.  Mitt Romney may not have scored the White House gig, but at least he’ll have something to laugh at. Or maybe not. A photograph of Hillary Clinton looking like a badass diplomat while donning sunglasses and checking her phone went seriously viral. And thus, Texts From Hillary was born. The Tumblr created multi-pane pics that feature Hillz’s faux reactions to texts from people like Sarah Palin and Barack Obama. The creators of the Tumblr made the decision to go out on top after meeting the secretary of state. The dignified goodbye earns extra kudos, especially when most of the Internet would be happy to stretch its fame.  The Swedish Chef may have coined Börk speak, but in 2012, the Internet couldn’t get enough of Berk speak. A photograph of a vest-sporting girl holding Goosebumps books debuted on Reddit in March and soon inspired a series of advice animal knockoffs. The widespread use of Ermahgerd talk (or Berks speak) even spawned web translators to help people perfect their lisped quips. U.S. Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney did not win the most medals amongst the Fab Five, but her ‘tude-filled face did help make her the most Internet famous.  After a tumble on her signature event, Maroney had to settle for a silver medal in the vault competition. During the medal ceremony, a photographer snapped a shot that seemed to sum up the gymnast’s feelings about her second place finish. The scowl flipped its way across the web and got ‘Shopped to gold medal glory on the Tumblr McKayla Is Not Impressed and elsewhere.  President Obama even got in on the unimpressed action recently, solidifying McKayla Is Not Impressed as the meme for 2012. Photo via iStockphoto, fabervisum. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/entrepreneur-trends-2013/,5 Trends Entrepreneurs Will See in 2013,"Entrepreneurs are in for some big changes in 2013. That's the prediction of Ingrid Vanderveldt, Dell's ""entrepreneur in residence"" who works with the Dell Center for Entrepreneurs. Here are the rest of Vanderveldt's predictions for this year.
 Alternative financing strategies: Most businesses are still bootstrapping, but are encouraged by alternative funding options as more borrowers and lenders are getting creative. Crowdfunding (i.e. Kickstarter), peer-to-peer lending sites and Dell Innovators Credit Fund are just a few examples of innovative funding tools increasingly available to business leaders. Scalable technology: With the explosion of big data (predicted to increase 43% over the next 10 years) and accelerated adoption of the cloud, more and more companies will look to technology as a strategic advantage to scaling successfully. As budgets remain tight, business owners will increasingly look to outside tech vendors to serve as advisers and will expect them to provide IT services and tailored recommendations to meet their specific business needs. The human capital problem: One key finding from Dell’s ""Go Local"" nine-city tour was that entrepreneurs struggle with accessing good talent. A lot can be gained by understanding how to maximize current and potential human capital within a business and extended entrepreneurial ecosystem. Online and in-person networking opportunities have never been so valuable. Entrepreneurs are getting younger: Blogging, launching apps, publishing magazines and creating social networks, kids like author Adora Svitak, 15, and app-builder Robert Nay, 16, have created empires before they hit college. In light of this growing trend, Dell will sponsor this year’s Clinton Global Initiative University (CGI U) and support millennial entrepreneurship at CGI U 2013, providing students with opportunities to learn about the multifaceted risks and opportunities involved with launching, running and growing a business. Social entrepreneurship: The concept of doing well by doing good has caught fire in a time where economic, social and environmental sustainability are more meaningful than ever. Strong focus on positive social and environmental impact has spurred contests, scholarships and even best business practices to be centered around the concept of giving to a global community.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/felt-audio-pulse-speaker/,Tiny Bluetooth Speaker Piggybacks on Your Smartphone,"LAS VEGAS — There's no shortage of Bluetooth speakers at the 2013 International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week, but we're quite taken with the tiny-sized Pulse speaker and Rewind earbuds from Felt Audio.  The Pulse speaker ($99) piggybacks onto an iPhone case for easy carrying and can be plucked off and clipped onto something nearby. For example, when driving in a car and wanting to talk hands-free (with good audio), clip the small speaker onto the car visor or seat belt, so chatting is easy without a headset. The Pulse provides Bluetooth capabilities up to 40 feet, so you can use it in an office or at home to blast music too. (We gave it a listen and were impressed with the quality, especially from such a small device).  SEE ALSO: Without a Wall Charger? The Nectar Powers Devices for Up to Two In addition, the speaker is great for those who use the treadmill — clip it to your sweatpants and attach Felt Audio's earbuds to the device to get rid of earbuds danging from a smartphone (audio will be redirected to the Bluetooth speaker). An accompanying earbud cartridge, with retractable earbuds, can tack on to the speaker, so it takes worrying about your smartphone out of the equation during a workout.  The company said it will be giving away free custom-made iPhone, iPad and iPod touch cases that Rewind earbuds and Pulse speaker to the first 5,000 purchasers, but it hasn't decided how much they will cost in the future.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/ford-glympse/,"Ford Adds Support For Glympse, Lets Friends Know When You'll Arrive","LAS VEGAS — Real-time location-sharing app Glympse announced plans Monday to bring its app into Ford vehicles. The first location-sharing app for Ford's SYNC in-car connectivity system, Ford drivers will now be able use voice commands to let friends, family, and colleagues know exactly where they are while driving. ""People typically share their location while in the car, and by integrating Glympse into Ford SYNC AppLink, we're providing drivers with a rich, real-time and hands-free way to share where they are,"" said Bryan Trussel, co-founder and CEO of Glympse.  To use Glympse, drivers will download the app onto their iPhones or Android devices, and then Bluetooth-pair or USB-connect that phone to a Ford SYNC AppLink-enabled vehicle. Once connected, a driver can press the SYNC voice button on the steering wheel of the car and say ""Send Glympse"" while theyâ€™re on the road and share their location. Voice commands guide drivers through the location-sharing process, and send the car's exact location to a contact in their phones. Location details can also be posted on Facebook and Twitter. The recipient of your Glympse can monitor where your vehicle is in real time on a map on a smartphone or the web. So, you can know exactly when your teenager will be home from a party, or keep track of your business partner whoâ€™s stuck in traffic on the way to a big meeting.  A timer limits how long your location is visible.  This lets you choose to share your location with your colleague for an hour while you're on your way to a meeting, but not continue sharing your location once the meeting is over and you're headed home. ""Glympse is a great example of how smartphone app integration with the car can help us make the driving experience more convenient for our customers, thus adding perceived value to their vehicle,"" said Julius Marchwicki, Ford SYNC AppLink program manager.  Glympse recently partnered with Mercedes-Benz to integrate the app into the new Mercedes-Benz Digital DriveStyle application If you don't have a qualifying vehicle, you can still take advantage of Glympse, just in a different way. The app is available for Android, iPhone, Windows Phone and BlackBerry, and lets you share your location in real time — just without the integrated voice functionality available with the Ford Sync. Not just for driving, the app can be used any time you need to track another person's location. For instance, a runner might use the app to share his location with a family member in case something happens while he's out training for a marathon. Would you like to be able to share your location while driving with others? Let us know what you think in the comments.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/ftc-google-leaks/,Congressman Demands Investigation of Google FTC Probe Leaks,"Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, demanded an investigation of the Federal Trade Commission's role in sharing private information about the Commission's Google probe before the results of which were publicly announced, according to a letter obtained by Mashable. Issa made the request in a Jan. 3 letter to FTC Investigator General Scott Wilson. Ongoing FTC investigations are legally private. However, information about the Google investigation was reported in several media outlets, among them Reuters, Politico and Bloomberg, well before the FTC made those details public Thursday.  The sources for those early reports were kept confidential. The FTC is legally prohibited from sharing investigation details with the media or public before a probe is complete.  When asked for comment, an FTC spokesperson told Mashable only that the Commission has ""received the letter.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/fujifilm-50x-superzoom/,Fujifilm Cranks Superzoom Cameras Up to 50x With FinePix SL1000,"LAS VEGAS — Superzoom cameras — point-and-shoot models that have incredible magnification — have become a mini category unto themselves over the past couple of years, and Fujifim wants to be the big fish in that pond. With the FinePix SL1000, it takes the superzoom to a new level with an optical zoom that goes up to 50x. A 24-1200mm lens has some serious zoom power, but it's only practical if the camera also has equally impressive image stabilization, and Fuji promises exactly that. The Fujinon zoom lens has a brand-new optical stabilization system that's said to reduce the blur for those extreme close-ups. As most point-and-shoot owners know, sometimes it's irritating that the zoom control is built into the bezel around the shutter button, since you have to move your trigger finger off the zoom before you can actually snap the photo, which can ruin the shot at extreme magnification. The SL1000 addresses this problem by building a secondary zoom control on the lens barrel, letting a shooter keep a finger on the shutter. You can also get even closer to your subject, albeit virtually, with the digital zoom, which can ""intelligently"" increase the zoom to 100x. Of course, if you're that far away, just write. How does the lens get so much magnification? It's made up of 17 elements in 12 groups, Fuji says, and it also ""combines aspherical and ED elements for reduced aberration and superior image quality."" All that optical tech doesn't just help with zooming, either — for macro photography, it can supposedly snap clear pics of subjects as close as 0.39 inches. The aperture ranges from f2.9-5.6. As a point-and-shoot, the SL1000 has does pretty well: The BSI-CMOS sensor can take photos up to 16 megapixels, with an ISO rating that goes as high as 12,800 for low-light situations. Autofocus is said to be as quick as 0.2 seconds, and it can shoot up to 10 photos per second at full resolution. The camera also includes a 3-inch tilting LCD, manual controls and a bunch of Instagram-like filters to spice up your pics. It costs $399.95 and will be available in March.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/htc-q1/,HTC 4Q Profit Falls 91% as Brand Falls Behind in Smartphone Wars,"HTC's losing streak continued on Monday as its fourth-quarter profit fell 91% thanks to poor sales in the U.S. market. The company posted a 4Q net profit of $34.4 million, its lowest since 2004, but still beating analysts' predictions of a $23 million net profit.  HTC's third-quarter profit had also fallen 79%; this is the company's fifth consecutive quarter with lower profits. The company is suffering a reverse in fortune that began in Q4 2011. Prior to that, HTC had several quarters of strong growth and record profits. HTC's dwindling share of the smartphone market prompted the shortfall. The company's global share for the devices was 4% in the third quarter of 2012 vs. 10.3% for the comparable period in 2011, according to IDC. Competitors like Samsung (31.3%) and Apple (15%) stole HTC's market share. Revenues for the quarter also fell 41% to $2 billion vs. the year-ago period.  HTC launched its Japan-only Butterfly smartphone in the fourth quarter. The model sports a 5-inch screen, which the company says will migrate to other models that are available in other countries. However, as Samsung and Nokia plan new smartphone launches in Q1, analysts predict a tough quarter.  Still, Chief Executive Peter Chou told The WSJ that he has reasons to be optimistic: ""The worst for HTC has probably passed,"" Chou said. ""2013 won't be too bad."" Image courtesy HTC "

The news comes just a few days after leaked images of the devices popped up online. First up is the mammoth Ascend Mate — which will go up against the Samsung Galaxy Note II — features a quad-core 1.5GHz processor and a 4050mAH battery. The display has a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels. Under the hood, the Ascend Mate runs Android 4.1. It's also gargantuan at 6.1-inches.   Meanwhile, the Ascend D2 is Huawei's chance at taking on the superphone market. The Ascend D2 has a 5-inch full HD display with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels. That gives it the same pixel density as the HTC's Droid DNA on Verizon. Like it's bigger sibling, the Ascend D2 runs on Android 4.1 and has a quad-core 1.5GHz processor. In addition to a 13-megapixel backside illuminated camera and a 3000mAh battery, the Ascend D2 was built to be water resistent. Huawei demonstrated its ability to work under wet conditions by throwing water on the device during the press conference.  We don't have any word on price or country availability of these devices but it looks like Huawei will start shipping soon. With any luck, 2013 will be Huawei's year to break out into the mainstream.

In addition to creating custom stations based on artists and songs or tuning in to its 1,500 live radio channels, users can now search through thousands of new options with a tool called Perfect For — as in, searching for music ""perfect for"" chilling out, cleaning the house and studying. SEE ALSO: iHeartRadio Hits 10 Million Users Faster Than Facebook or Twitter
 Here's how it works: After accessing the latest version of iHeartRadio on your iPhone or PC and selecting the new ""Perfect For"" tab, the platform presents a menu of moods and activities based on the day and time. This means users will see a different collection of stations in the morning — such as ""perfect for"" waking up — and might see ""caffeinated country"" later in the day. When a user picks a mood or activity, several genres or themes appear, including quirky ones such as ""Took My Wife, Took My Dog: Country's Greatest Break-up Music"" and ""Skinny Jeans: Boys with Guitars."" More stations will be added each day, the company said. iHeartRadio also introduced an alarm clock to compliment its previously launched Sleep Timer, which allows users to fall asleep and wake up to radio stations of their choice. Although the ""perfect for"" feature is only available for the iPhone right now, iHeartRadio told Mashable it's working on making it available on other mobile and tablet devices soon. ""The feature will initially be available for iPhones and PCs, but when users sign in on these devices they can save 'Perfect For' channels in their 'My Stations' and access them via any device where iHeartRadio is available,"" said Brian Lakamp, president of digital at Clear Channel.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/intel-awesome-laptop/,Intel Shows the Awesome Laptop You'll Be Using Next Year,"To show what its Fourth Generation Core processors will be capable of, Intel built the North Cape: an Ultrabook that converts to a tablet with a very long battery lift. LAS VEGAS — What will laptops look like a year from now? Intel knows, and the chip manufacturer gave the world a sneak peek at CES 2013 today with its reference PC design for the next generation of Core processors. The laptop, codenamed ""North Cape,"" isn't a real product; it's a machine that Intel's built to both test and showcase the capabilities of the Fourth Generation of Core processors (codenamed ""Haswell""). Haswell chips are scheduled for general release midyear. Intel had a few of the reference laptops at its press conference here in Vegas, and we got a little hands-on time with them. It's an impressively light device — noticeably easier to hold than like-sized laptops of today like the Lenovo Yoga. The screen is 13.3 inches, but not all the time. What's that, you ask? The screen size changes? Indeed it does: North Cape is also a convertible, with the monitor able to detach from the keyboard to become a tablet that's just 0.39 inch thick. However, the 13.3-inch screen runs almost to the edge of the bezel, not leaving much room for thumbs. But with the press of a button, the laptop scales the display down to an 11-inch size. That's new. North Cape's biggest improvement over the previous generation of machines will be battery life. Intel says that the jump in battery life between the current Core 3 machines and Core 4 will be the largest in the company's history. The reference laptop is said to get up to 13 hours of battery life while docked (there are batteries in both the keyboard and tablet/monitor). The extended battery life is a consequence of Intel's aggressive move to increase the efficiency of its chips as it changes the architecture. Chips in Ultrabooks that debuted last year consume about 17 watts, though Intel recently shrunk that down to 7 watts for some Core 3 designs, such as the Lenovo Yoga 11S. Haswell will bring it down even further. Ports on the back include a pair of USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI jack and a proprietary power port. How do you like the North Cape?

With the addition of a special fingertip reader, Masimo's new iSpO2 does exactly that. The $249 device, introduced here at CES 2013, is Masimo's first consumer product and is so easy to use you might image you too could be a doctor. You plug the reader into any iPhone, iPod or iPad that still has a 30-pin port, connect the reader to the tip of your ring finger and the device and accompanying software does the rest. Within a few moments, you get a live, graphic readout of your pulse rate, perfusion index and blood oxygenation. The app keeps track of all your readings, offering up graphs depicting your trends over time. You can even export the data in a CSV file. The fingertip reader works, by the way, by shining LED lights through your fingertip. Sensors on the other side read a variety of light wavelengths to come up with your health stats. What do all those readings mean? You probably have to be a doctor or have a medical book handy to really know. On the other hand, extreme athletes like bike racers might be able to use the iSpO2 to track their blood oxygenation levels. What do you think?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/land-a-job-at-spotify/,How to Land a Job at Spotify,"New year, new job? In our new Dream Job series, Mashable will take you behind the scenes at five hot startups, and we'll give you the scoop on how to land a job there, what positions are available, what kind of people they're looking for and what the culture is like. First up is Spotify, the digital music streaming service that launched in Sweden in 2008. The company has 700 employees across the globe, with 150 based in New York City. These Spotifiers work hard (and play hard) to supply a nearly endless stream of music to more than 20 million subscribers in 17 countries, and the platform's upcoming changes to music discovery will improve the user experience, and usher in a new era for the startup. Mashable spoke with Alexandra Cohen, Technical Recruiter at Spotify, to get the low-down on how to score a job there.  The Openings: There are a number of open positions within the Tech, Product, Operations, Sales, Marketing and Analytics Teams. Spotify has offices all over the world and is headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, and the Chelsea neighborhood of New York, where the company is doing most of its hiring. There are open sales positions in L.A., Chicago and the new San Francisco office (where there are also open positions in engineering and corporate roles). You can browse all open jobs here, and stay in the loop with frequent updates on the Spotify Jobs Facebook Page. Applicants can submit their resumes directly on the site or through third-party postings on LinkedIn, Github or Stack Overflow. 
A selection of the open positions in Spotify's New York office If you're applying for a tech position, and the Spotify team likes what they see on your resume, you'll be contacted for a phone or Skype interview with an engineer. Then you'll have a half-day of on-site interviews (three hourlong meetings with engineers, and lunch with an engineer). Depending on the position, you may have to complete a coding challenge at home before arriving onsite. If you're applying to work on the business side, you can expect one or two phone interviews and two or three hours of onsite interviews. The ideal candidate: ""We are looking for motivated, passionate people who want to accept the mission of helping people find the right music for every moment.""
 
Perks of the Job: ""Private live concerts in the office, all new employees get to go to intro days in Stockholm, catered lunches on Fridays, fully stocked kitchen, ping pong and video games in the office, free concert tickets, gym membership and commuter discounts.""
 
 Company Culture: ""It is a work hard, play hard type of environment filled with tons of energy (thanks to the constant supply of gourmet coffee and Red Bull) and a casual dress code. We have even tried to implement formal Fridays so employees have a chance to wear all their nice work clothes they used to wear at their old jobs."" Travel: ""Since we are a global company, you may have the opportunity to visit the two main offices in Sweden, or travel to any of our other offices around the world.""  The best part about working here is:
 ""The live performances! Getting private concerts from Joss Stone and Matisyahu are definitely huge perks to the job."" - Alexandra Cohen, Technical Recruiter ""The office is fast-paced, energetic, always buzzing, and we're all friends."" - Dave Altarescu, U.S. Marketing Director ""The intimate relationship between product development and engineering, and how that allows developers to have a meaningful impact on the product and the users."" - Nicholas Harteau, VP, Engineering When I started working here, I was surprised by...
 How collaborative we are as a company. No matter what country you work in or what department you're a part of, everyone works together."" - Alexandra Cohen, Technical Recruiter ""How even though we've grown so quickly, we've still managed to keep that startup feel to the office."" - Dave Altarescu, U.S. Marketing Director ""The complete and utter lack of politics, the degree to which everyone is hyper-focused on the same goal."" - Nicholas Harteau, VP, Engineering Image courtesy of Charlie Hellman "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/lego-taking-robotics-to-next-level-with-mindstorms-ev3/,LEGO Taking Robotics to Next Level with Mindstorms EV3,"LAS VEGAS — Robot dreams are built one-piece-at-a-time. That is if you're one of the many fans of LEGO's Mindstorms Robot Building Kits. Launched in 1998, the kid-friendly, DIY set has a legion of fans ranging from the enterprising 10-year-old, to University-level researchers. Now the popular robot playground is getting its biggest update in six years with the new LEGO Mindstorms EV3. Unveiled at CES 2013, the new robot building kit, which coincides with Mindstorm's 15th anniversary, includes 601 LEGO pieces, sensors, programming software and, at its heart, a programmable ""brick"" that always sits, figuratively and literally, at the center of any LEGO Mindstorms project. It, along with virtually everything else in the kit, has been upgraded. For example, there's now more feedback on the black-and-white LCD screen.  Young robot builders can actually do all their programming on the brick. Running Linux, the brick (and therefore the robots you build) is also totally hackable. It also features a micro SD card slot for additional memory and a USB port for, well, LEGO doesn't know what people will do with it. However, since the Mindstorms EV3 brick does not include Wi-Fi, some robot builders might use it to add a Wi-Fi USB dongle. As before, sensors plug directly into the brick, including the new IR robot eyes that react  to interaction and can be used to follow the new remote control. LEGO still provides powerful, object-based programming software that you run on your PC, but Mindstorms EV3 will also let young programmers control their robots via freely downloadable smart phone and tablet-based games and apps. We test-drove a prototype Android based app that let us control snake-like robot by moving the phone around. Tipping the phone back and forth controlled forward and backward movement, a shake make the bot shake and a forward thrust made the snakebot lunch forward and try to bite you (very entertaining)., In other words, young programmers will be able to use their smart device's innate capabilities, like the accelerometer , to create unique and entertaining interactions  with their robot creations. Most of the Mindstorms robot creations have undergone a makeover as well. The kits has always featured a humanoid ""hero"" robot, but the new Everstorm has a sleeker, more complex look. In fact all the robots are a tad more anthropomorphic and also more playful. LEGO execs tell us that children see robots not as objects, but as extensions of themselves, things with personalities, and the new looks are an outgrowth of that child-like perspective. As always LEGO Mindstorms will come with lots of guidance to help young roboticists build their first robot, including a new iPad-based, interactive 3D-model building guide that LEGO created with Autodesk. It shows pieces in three dimensions, lets you spin them around and zoom in and out with your fingers and then can, via onscreen animations, show you exactly where each piece is supposed to go.

Ever since HDTVs reached the majority of U.S. households, TV manufacturers have searched for new ways to get those big margins back on the models they sell. It didn't work with 3D, so now they're looking to new technologies to help them out. LG has high hopes for high prices in OLED displays, and it just set a big price on its 55-inch model. The set will cost $12,000 when it becomes available in March this year. That's pretty steep — especially considering the set is a 1080p display and not one of the newer Ultra HD 4K TVs. However, the OLED set brings to the table the technology's super-slim profile (it's extremely thin for a 55-inch set) as well as impressive brightness, which produces eye-popping color. We saw the set in the flesh at LG's press conference at CES 2013, and there's no question it produces an incredible picture. Is it $12,000 of incredible, though? You tell us. Would you pay that much for a TV, even if it was the most lifelike picture ever? Tell us in the comments. It's not even 4K but the OLED screen might make it worthwhile for cinephiles. Welcome to 4K UltraHD. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/lionel-messi-fashion-moments/,6 of Lionel Messi's Greatest Fashion Moments,"Lionel Messi isn't just the world's greatest soccer player, he's also something of an interesting fashion case.  From the polka-dot suit he donned on Monday to accept his fourth Ballon d'Or to the floppy Beatles-esque haircut he rocked in his earlier days to his frequent resemblance of a teenage skater, the Argentine goal machine keeps us entertained with more than just his on-field heroics.  SEE ALSO: Messi's Year of Dominance: Watch All 91 Goals in One Epic Mashup
 Buckle your Gucci seatbelt and take a ride through some of Messi's greatest fashion triumphs below. 1. The 'When You Score 91 Goals in a Calendar Year, You Can Wear Whatever You Damn Well Please' Look  Messi was resplendent in this reverse-dalmatian polka-dot number when accepting the Ballon d'Or on Monday, sparking plenty of chatter and snide comments on Twitter. But when you score goals at the record-setting rate he did in 2012, you've pretty much earned the right to do whatever you want. (Getty Images/AFP/Fabrice Coffrini) 2. The 'Hairy Middle Schooler' Look  In part because he stands just 5-foot-7, Messi often ends up looking like a well-built, hyper-focused middle schooler. He and his FC Barcelona teammates wore these T-shirts in 2011 to honor ailing teammate Eric Abidal, but no one pulled it off quite like Lionel. (Getty Images/AFP/Josep Lago) 3. The 'Fashion-Forward Shepherd' Look  This is what Messi wore to the pre-Ballon d'Or ceremony press conference for award nominees on Monday. We're not quite sure what's going on here — it's sort of a hybrid hoodie/outdoor-wear/knit deal, and he seems to sporting a deep-V white tee underneath. Whatever this is, it's safe to say the polka-dot suit he changed in to later was an upgrade. (Getty Images/Getty Images Sport/Christof Koepsel) 4. The 'Beatles Mop-Top' Look  This was Messi's look at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, calling to mind the style of four young Liverpool lads back in the 1960s. The Flea's on-field wizardry was all the more magical when he was flummoxing defenders with this shaggy 'do instead of the more conservative coif he sports today. (Getty Images/Getty Images Sport/Richard Heathcote) 5. The 'Straight Up Speedo' Look  Yes, we totally get that the Speedo is an accepted form of male swimming attire outside the United States. But for us here in the U.S., it's still a goofy way to roll — especially, for some reason, when you're Lionel Messi. This is our hero relaxing in Rio de Janeiro with then-girlfriend and now-wife Antonella Roccuzzo in 2010. (Getty Images/AFP) 6. The 'School You With My Eyes Closed' Look  Messi's fashion innovations extend to the pitch itself, too — here he finds a new way to wear his Barca colors. Or perhaps, for (arguably) the greatest player of all time, having full visibility just makes the game a little too easy. (Getty Images/AFP/Lluis Gene) But Messi's outstanding fashion moments don't end here. For example, he also apparently loves wearing this one pair of ripped, acid-washed jeans.  Of course, while Messi has exerted four years of player-of-the-year dominance over rival Cristiano Ronaldo, this photo of a murse-wielding CR7 proves that Messi still does have some work to do when it comes to bizarre fashion choices.

""Going freemium was an easy decision for us,"" Livio founder and CEO Jake Sigal said during a news conference at the show. ""Our new model allows us to work with app developers of any and every size, at a price they can afford. As their automotive business grows, we participate in their success.â€ Sigal said the 2013 additions to the network will expand the in-vehicle infotainment offerings beyond music apps like Pandora and Spotify to include traffic, parking, weather and navigation. SEE ALSO: So You Want to Be an App Developer? Here's How  Sigal said people want to be able to use apps in their car and, while vehicles today have infotainment, if it's not what you enjoy using, it's useless. ""Consumers want to bring their phones into cars,"" he told Mashable, ""we just want to find a safe way to bring that in."" When asked about the safety of using apps — and phones — in cars, Sigal said their job is to ""provide the tools to allow OEMs to control the experience for the consumer while maintaining the branded presence of your favorite apps with your favorite buttons and favorite commands."" In other words, he said, ""I don't expect to see Angry Birds anytime soon in the vehicle, and you might Facebook yourself into a tree if you're driving down the road but I think we're offering a safe way for OEM's to have control over safety."" Livio Connect also showed off the new FM Connect, which enables in-car FM radio listeners to gain an enhanced experience through a Bluetooth-connected smartphone.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/mcafee-spying/,McAfee Claims He Uncovered Terrorist Plot by Spying on Authorities,"John McAfee has spent the last few weeks first as a fugitive, blogging about it — even from jail — and then getting caught because two reporters revealed his location when they uploaded a picture to gloat that they were with him. He was finally extradited to the U.S. before Christmas.  But if you thought his bizarre and crazy story was over, you were wrong. The founder of the eponymous antivirus company now claims that he spied on Belize authorities with laptops infected with malware and a bunch of women and men, hired to be his personal spies. Allegedly, this complex operation led him to uncover an international plan to smuggle terrorists into the U.S.  Unbelievable right? That might be because it's all a bunch of lies. In fact, practically everything McAfee wrote in his blog post is unverifiable. And McAfee himself hasn't been exactly trustworthy since he went into hiding after the Belize police came looking to question him about his neighbors' death. For example, when two Vice reporters mistakenly uploaded a picture that revealed his location in Guatemala, McAfee said that actually he had forged that information himself, claiming he was safely hiding somewhere else. That turned out to be a lie.  His latest story started in May, when the Belize police raided McAfee's house, searching for drugs and firearms and arresting him for a few hours. In the end, no charges were brought against him but, according to McAfee, he didn't receive any apologies either. And that's when he decided to take the matter into his own hands and retaliate. ""I had asked for a simple apology and had received none,"" he wrote in the post. ""I was pissed. They had shot my dog, destroyed my property and stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of things that I valued. They have still not been returned."" Revenge wasn't his only motive though, he himself isn't sure what his motive was. ""Much of my life is a mystery to me.  Suffice it to say: I just did it because I could."" McAfee explains that he bought the laptops, installed ""invisible keystroke logging software"" on them and started giving them away ""to select people"" like ""government employees, police officers, Cabinet Minister's assistants, girlfriends of powerful men, boyfriends of powerful women."" The malware was designed to record everything these people typed on the laptops and send it back to McAfee. This way, McAfee claims he found out people's passwords to their Facebook accounts, emails and any other private account they might have accessed. For all this sophisticated spying enterprise to work, McAfee needed help. That's why he initially hired four people to monitor the text files containing the key logs that the computers were automatically sending back. Then, to take the spying to a whole another level, he hired 23 women and six men to be his ""operatives.""  ""These men and women were given simple training on how to access and load software on someone's computer while they slept, or ate or made long phone calls etc,"" McAfee writes. Basically, they became his spy honey traps. And, according to him, they were pretty good at it too. So good, in fact, that eight of those 23 women ended up living with him to work closely with him. And one of them even tried to kill him because she was a double agent. McAfee doesn't bother explaining more about that though. Maybe in his next blog post.
 
McAfee goes on to claim another spying achievement thanks to his operatives, who were armed with ""software, presents, a story, a seductive smile and a small voice recorder."" Thanks to them he allegedly infiltrated two phone companies and tapped his targets' phones, listening to their calls.  SEE ALSO: John McAfee's Exploits Hurt the McAfee Brand, Study Says
 What did all this spying lead to? Initially, nothing surprising: ""uncountable numbers of sexual affairs — embarrassingly lurid and intimate chats,"" and, you know, the usual proof of human trafficking, which McAfee dismisses as ""uninteresting old news.""  That's not all, though. In what might be the most outlandish detail in an already bizarre story, McAfee then claims he discovered that many alleged male prostitutes being smuggled into the country and given Belize passports were actually Lebanese terrorists. McAfee then vaguely describes an international plan to smuggle the prostitute/terrorists into the U.S. through Belize and Nicaragua. And in a made-for-tv cliffhanger, he also promises to give us more details about it soon. In the meantime, he will take ""a well-earned vacation into the heartland of the Midwest,"" where he can blend with ranchers and cowboys who, according to McAfee, ""are a sympathetic lot.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/nvidia-project-shield/,"Nvidia Unveils Project Shield, a Powerful Android Game Controller","LAS VEGAS — If you thought chip makers only messed around with the insides of our gadgets, think again. Nvidia, the graphics-card and mobile-processor manufacturer, surprised a packed house at a nightclub at the Palms hotel in Vegas with Project Shield, a powerful Android game controller that packs the company's latest and greatest mobile chip, the Tegra 4. Project Shield isn't a peripheral. It's a full game console unto itself, with a 5-inch retina display that folds up from the controls. It can connect to the Android ecosystem and Google Play store via Wi-Fi, and players can mirror what's onscreen to a TV either wirelessly or via HDMI. It doesn't stop there. In addition to having access to Android's app catalog (including many Tegra-optimized games), Shield can access PC games from a computer on the network, then relay the gameplay to a TV. All the while, the user plays the game with the Shield. The controller is packed with batteries for extended gameplay, a bass-reflex speaker for big sound and ports for HDMI and USB. The lid has an area for a custom tag. There's no price or release date, and from the unveiling it's apparent the Shield isn't quite ready for prime time. While demo'ing the device, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang failed to make an adequate PC link, although event staff were able to correct the problem after a few minutes. Huang also slipped at one point, saying the product was called ""Project Thor,"" which he all but admitted was the name of another secret Nvidia project. Still, the Shield is an impressive device, and it looks capable of taking the idea of mobile gaming to another level. What do you think of it? Share your thoughts in the comments.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/nvidia-tegra-4/,Nvidia Launches Tegra 4 Mobile Quad-Core Chip,"LAS VEGAS — Nvidia, the company that makes the mobile processors in many Android devices including the Google Nexus 7 tablet, today officially launched its next mobile chip, the Tegra 4. The quad-core Tegra 4 is said to have six times the processing power of its predecessor, the Tegra 3. To show just how powerful the chip is, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang demonstrated how a Tegra 4-powered devices could take photos with high dynamic range (HDR) in essentially real time, with no discernible delay between the multiple shots required to assemble the composite pics. Huang also claimed the Tegra 4 had more processing power than even the iPad 4, which Mashable's own tests showed had an incredibly fast chip. The Tegra 4 boasts similar energy efficiency as the Tegra 3 since it has the same architecture, with a fifth core that helps regulate energy use. With its power-efficient design, the Tegra 4 is said to enable up to 14 hours of video playback on smartphones. The new Tegra is based on an ARM Cortex-A15 CPU design, and contains 72 individual Nvidia GeForce graphics cores. Huang demonstrated the chip's graphical powers by having a Tegra 4-powered device push 4K-resolution video to an Ultra HDTV. One of the first Tegra 4-powered devices will actually be an Nvidia-designed and -made product, a handheld Android gaming controller called Project Shield.

At least, that's the conceit of this ad campaign for the radio station.  One, however, would think Obama had a better means of tuning in the station and that he wouldn't be listening on the front lawn of the White House with his dog Bo in tow. Another ad in the series from Y&R Israel (below) shows Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad listening to the station in his bathtub. Finally, there's Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who is shown with his radio cradled next to his ear in his bombed-out office. All three ads contain the caption ""When it's important to you to know what's really going on with the [Israeli] elections.""      Image courtesy of  Y&R Israel "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/omron-fitness-monitors/,Omron Activity Monitor: The Training Wheels of Calorie Counters," LAS VEGAS — While there is no shortage of fitness devices on display here at the 2013 International CES, there is at least a new way to measure all the running, walking and calorie counting you do. Omron's Activity Monitor tracks your activity and exercise data, and reveals your total calories burned throughout the day. It was shown Monday in a news conference at CES along with other new devices from Omron. Randy Kellogg, vice president of marketing and product development at Omron HealthCare told Mashable these are designed to not be too complicated. He likens it to a set of training wheels. While people may eventually graduate to a Nike FuelBand or FitBit device, they can sometimes be too complicated for people who just want to get started.  ""Everybody can walk 2,000 steps and track their activity,"" he said.   Consumers are looking for simple and social, according to Omron. Kellogg says women like to walk together, they like to share information so they added a social component through Ormonfitness.com. The goal tracker helps you set targets and the monitor will let you know how much of what type of activity you need to do to reach those goals. One feature we're not entirely sold on is an NFC communication tray (sold separately) that connects the tracker to your computer. It works with Mac and PC and wirelessly transfers the data so you can monitor your progress on omronfitness.com. We would much prefer to see a Bluetooth option which Kellogg says is an open option for the next version. The Activity Monitor will cost $49.99 when it launches and the NFC tray will sell for $20. Omron also introduced a Strapless Heart Rate Monitor, for those who don't like the feel of a chest strap when they work out. All your data, including target heart rate appears on a device you wear on your wrist. That will cost $149.99 and is expected to be out in the next month.  There's also a Tri-Axis USB Pedometer which will be available for around $45. In the end, Kellogg says, it doesn't matter what kind of device you choose, as long as you get up and walk. It reduces stress and improves your health. You don't have to run a marathon, but you can find out how close you're getting to one. What features do you look for in a fitness device?

""Kiss You"" arrived Monday after One Direction teased fans daily with a series of promo videos on YouTube. The buzz-building tactic — satisfying for some and annoying to others — has previously been employed by Matchbox 20, Britney Spears and other artists. After its release, #KissYouOnVEVO became the top worldwide trending topic on Twitter. SEE ALSO: One Direction Puts on Football Gear in Follow-Up to Viral Ad [PICS]

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/panasonic-second-screen/,Panasonic Lets You Edit Photos on TV with Touch Pen,"LAS VEGAS — Panasonic today showed off a new vision of the second screen, introducing new ways your phone or tablet can interact with what you're watching on TV.  Part of the vision: a new accessory called the Touch Pen that lets you edit photos right on the screen, then immediately push them to a mobile device. Last year Panasonic released Swipe and Share, a way to relay content from smartphone to TV and back; now it's launching version 2.0 of that software. Whereas before you could send content like a photo to your TV via a smartphone or tablet app, now you can interact with that content via the TV. In the case of photos, you can actually edit them — which is where the Touch Pen comes in. Users can write notes or draw pictures on the screen with the Pen, assisted by a pull-down menu that appears when the pen touches the TV. Those edited pictures can then be pulled back down to any mobile device. In addition Swipe and Share 2.0, Panasonic is enhancing its second-screen experience through partnerships with HSN, which has developed a app called Shop by Remote, which lets users get detailed product information and read customer reviews of whatever they're checking out on the channel. Starting in the spring, Panasonic's 2013 smart TVs will also integrate YouTube's new second-screen experience, which lets you queue up YouTube videos for watching on TV as well as control the playback, all from your phone. Finally, Panasonic has completely revamped the home screen of its smart TVs, putting all the different kinds of content (live TV, on-demand video, apps, etc.) all in one place. The interface features multiple user profiles, and it'll work with the TV's front-facing camera to recognize who's watching and call up their preferences. How do you like Panasonic's new smart TV tricks and the Touch Pen: great stuff or meh? Let us know in the comments. Powerful yet fun DIY robotics for adults and children.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/pantech-discover-att/,Pantech Discover Is Headed to AT&T January 11,"LAS VEGAS — The Pantech Discover is on its way to AT&T. At CES Monday the carrier announced plans to start carrying the Android handset on January 11. The 4.8-inch smartphone has a 1280x720 high-definition display, surround sound speakers, NFC functionality, and a 12.6-megapixel built-in digital camera capable of recording 1080p video at 30 frames per second.  The phone will operate on AT&T's 4G LTE network. Following in the footsteps of the Pantech Flex, which was released on AT&T in September, the phone will offer Pantech's Easy Experience mode,  which makes interacting with Android easier for new users.  Users can also opt to use the Standard Experience mode on the handset. Both modes — standard on the left and easy on the right — are shown in the photo below.  The Discover will also be the first smartphone from AT&T to come pre-loaded with AT&T's DriveMode application, an app that attempts to prevent texting and driving. Once set up, the app will auto-reply to messages that are sent while in a vehicle moving over 25mph, allowing driverâ€™s to let friends and family know theyâ€™re behind the wheel.  SEE ALSO: AT&T's 'It Can Wait' Campaign Attempts To Curb Texting While Driving ""AT&T is dedicated to educating customers about the dangers of texting while driving and providing real solutions to help prevent the behavior.  With DriveMode pre-loaded on the Discover, we hope that users will be less likely to text and drive."" Calls that come while a user is driving can be automatically sent to voicemail. Users have the ability to turn that feature off, and can create an ""allow list"" of specific callers that will always get through while they're on the road. The Pantech Discover will be available on January 11 for $49.99 with a new 2-year agreement. Powerful yet fun DIY robotics for adults and children.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/papertab/,PaperTab Is a Tablet as Thin and Flexible as Paper," Are tablets of today too fat and clunky for you? Meet PaperTab, a 10.7-inch tablet that's almost as thin — and flexible — as a sheet of paper.  Developed by Plastic Logic, PaperTab has a flexible touchscreen that lets users send files and emails and navigate through pages of documents using hand gestures. One can also combine several PaperTabs into one larger surface by placing them side by side, or share files by touching one tablet to another.  PaperTab is powered by an Intel i5 processor, which seems to be separate from the actual display and connected to the PaperTab with a thin data cable. We're unsure if this is the way the device is planned to work when finalized or it's just a prototype. We'll find out pretty soon, as Plastic Logic plans to reveal PaperTab to the press Tuesday at CES 2013.  ""Plastic Logic's flexible plastic displays are completely transformational in terms of product interaction. They allow a natural human interaction with electronic paper, being lighter, thinner and more robust compared with todayâ€™s standard glass-based displays,"" says Indro Mukerjee, CEO of Plastic Logic.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/philips-fidelio-p8-speaker/,Philips Brings the Smart Cover to Bluetooth Speakers,"LAS VEGAS — When Apple debuted its Smart Cover for the iPad, which automatically shuts the tablet off when it's closed via magnets, many thought it was a brilliant idea. That apparently includes Philips, which brings the Smart Cover concept to its wireless Fidelio P8 speaker. The P8 is built to deliver serious sound, with a pair of woofers and Philips' proprietary ""wOOx"" audio tech, which is said to make the bass pound even harder. But it impresses with how you silence it: Just fold its leather-like cover and the speaker goes into standby mode, killing the sound instantly. The speaker also is equipped with a touch sensor, which shows how much juice is remaining in the lithium-ion battery — up to eight hours at full charge. It connects to your phone (or other source) via Bluetooth, but there's also an auxiliary input. The P8 is coming in March for $199.99. Would you like Philips' new speaker instead of a Jambox?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/philips-fidelio-soundbar/,Philips Packs Removable Surround Speakers Into a Soundbar,"LAS VEGAS — Fans of surround sound detest the proliferation of single-speaker soundbars, but there's no question they're convenient. What if you could have the best of both worlds: a simple soundbar for your casual listening, but with removable surround speakers for when you want those immersive sound effects? That's exactly what the Philips Fidelio soundbar is. At 46 inches long, it's one of the lengthier soundbars, but it gets a tad shorter when you detach the surround speakers from both sides. With the two speakers removed, the center unit retains the front, left and right channels. The surrounds are wireless, so no worries about tripping over cables. Place on end tables or hung on your walls, the surround speakers have enough juice for about 10 hours of listening, and they start recharging the instant you put them back on the main unit. SEE ALSO: 10 Smart Tips for Buying an HDTV
 You can get the Fidelio soundbar with or without a separate subwoofer, which is also wireless (though obviously it, like the main unit, needs a power cord). Coming in May, they cost $799 with the sub (HTL9100) and $599 without (HTL7100). They're separate products, with different sound processing, so it'd be a bad idea to get the standalone unit and pair a sub later. We love the idea of a soundbar that includes surrounds when you want 'em — perfect for apartments where space is limited. How do you like the Fidelio soundbar? Let us know in the comments.

Conventional wisdom suggests that in an age of rampant piracy, letting listeners sample music legitimately will curb illegal downloading, and in the case of rising acts, might even entice people to buy something that otherwise would have been off their radar.  Soundcloud and Bandcamp offer artists the opportunity to share music directly with their fans. For some a media partner offers increased visibility and legitimacy. NPR and AOL's Spinner, to name two, consistently offer sets of advance album streams. With Pitchfork Advance, the site will try to offer an experience that exceeds the capabilities of other streaming platforms. Not unlike their series of Cover Stories, which explore the web as a storytelling platform, Pitchfork Advance hopes to turn album listening into a visual, interactive experience. ""In most cases, the artwork we publish will come from the album's actual packaging, but there will be some other material that's created exclusively for Pitchfork Advance,"" said Pitchfork founder Ryan Schreiber. ""We can do a lot more with this platform than just reproduce static images and text.""  The Yo La Tengo stream, for example, is accompanied by a virtual ""CD booklet"" in the form of a stream of video loops.   ""I've been surprised by the lack of innovation in digital album art over the last decade, especially because artists and labels are still designing elaborate packaging for physical releases,"" Schreiber said.  Though eventually the goal is for it to work on mobile, it's currently a desktop experience only. Perhaps this is most indicative of what Pitchfork wants you to do: Listen to albums, distraction-free. The adherence to the album may seem old-school in the era of iTunes singles, but albums are still at the core of Pitchfork's world view. The site publishes five lengthy album reviews every weekday, and its yearly best albums list takes top billing amid its end-of-year coverage. Not surprisingly, many on Pitchfork staff are vinyl collectors - including Schreiber.  ""Pitchfork Advance allows you to have an experience with the music that's immersive in the way that engaging with a vinyl LP would be,"" he said. Does listening in advance help you decide to buy music? Let us know in the comments.  Screenshot courtesy of Pitchfork "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/polaroid-android-camera/,Polaroid Unveils First Android Camera With Removable Lens,"LAS VEGAS — We love the Android-powered Samsung Galaxy Camera, but it is a point-and-shoot, so its ability to capture really eye-popping shots is limited. That's why we're excited the check out the Polaroid iM1836, the world's first Android-powered camera with an interchangeable lens, which makes its debut Monday at CES. Built by Polaroid partner Sakar, the iM1836 runs Android 4.1 ""Jelly Bean,"" theoretically making it capable of the same photo-sharing and editing tricks you can perform on the Galaxy Camera (or any Android 4.1 smartphone, really). It comes with a 10-30mm zoom lens, but of course you can swap that out for others. Polaroid says it's compatible with any Micro Four Thirds lens as long as you have an optional adapter. The camera can take pictures up to 18 megapixels, and video up to 1080p. There's also an HDMI output for direct connection to a TV. One big way Polaroid's Android camera differs from Samsung's: There's no option for a data plan. That means you'll be relying on either Wi-Fi or your smartphone to access the Internet, and it comes ready to tether (via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth). The LCD touch screen in back measures 3.5 inches (quite a bit smaller than the Galaxy's beautiful 4.8-inch display) and it has a pop-up flash. Camera features include: auto blink detection, auto face exposure and panorama mode. Coming in the first quarter of 2013, the iM1836 will cost $399. We're eager to try out Polaroid's Android camera, though it has a tough act to follow in the Samsung Galaxy Camera. That device showcased Samsung's expertise in Android, with a beautiful interface for manual controls and many of the same picture-taking modes found on Samsung's smartphones. What do you think? Is an Android camera with interchangeable lenses something you want? Or should the OS stick to point-and-shoots? Share your thoughts in the comments.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/power-matters-alliance-organization/,The Tech World Gets Behind Wireless Charging for Real,"LAS VEGAS — Charging your mobile device wirelessly via a chip embedded into a Starbucks table or resting it on a surface inside your car could become more commonplace in the next year or so, thanks to the latest backing of a larger effort to make wireless charging more a part of everyday life. It was announced on Monday at the 2013 International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that 30 companies across the smartphone ecosystem are joining the Power Matters Alliance (PMA) organization, which consists of government leaders and major companies such as Starbucks, AT&T and Google working to get rid of cable-based charging plugs and embrace wireless power. Smartphone case manufacturers such as Otterbox and chipset vendor Integrated Device Technology are among the new wave of companies backing the PMA, which was founded by Duracell's Powermat and its parent company Procter & Gamble and Powermat Technologies in March 2012.  SEE ALSO: Jay-Z Wants You to Put Your Phone Down to Charge It Up
 ""For wireless power to really transform our lives, a lot of things have to come together, from how companies make their products to public spaces deploying the right technology for charging,"" Daniel Schreiber, president of Powermat and Power Matters Alliance board member, told Mashable. ""We are becoming so dependent on our mobile devices, and people want longer battery life. We want to tackle that issue, but we need manufacturers and companies to get on the same page."" With the most recent backing of Starbucks, Google and AT&T in October and existing support from Facebook, General Motors and Delta Airlines — which is already using wireless charging in its Sky Club lounges — more are looking to join in. In fact, after Starbucks announced it would introduce Duracell Powermat charging stations embedded into tables at 17 locations in Boston, PMA membership has skyrocketed, tripling in the past month alone. ""Eventually, we will reach a tipping point where it transforms from being cool to becoming an industry standard and expectation,"" Schreiber said. Madison Square Garden has also embraced PMA wireless charging stations, as well as various salons, restaurants and airports across the U.S. Among the new batch of companies joining include case makers Incipio and Skech, as well as APS Technologies, Diodes, Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), Everpurse, Foxlink, IGRS China, Leyden Energy, Microsemi, Microtips Technology, Monolithic Power Systems, MxMedia, NXT health, NXP Semiconductors, ON Semiconductor, Silicon laboratories, Telegesis, TennRich International and World Fair International.  ""Wireless cases will be important for promoting this lifestyle, and this is where accessory manufacturers come into play,"" Schreiber said. ""Duracell also has portable batteries for wireless charging and there are WiCC wireless charging cards that are insertable and could become embeddable. This is the start of the future."" However, the PMA has had its share of competition from other groups such as Wireless Power Consortium, which supports the Qi standard. The WPC has backing from heavy hitters too, including hardware companies such as Samsung, Motorola and HTC. But the rapid member growth of the PMA from both small and large companies indicates we might see more wireless charging of this nature. ""It's really important to create an ecosystem we can all get behind,"" Schreiber said. ""It hasn't happened yet, but it's our hope and expectation we will all get there."" Image via Duracell "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/rage-comics-dying/,"Rage Comics Are Dying a Slow, Painful Death","The Internet's long communal nightmare may finally be ending. We now have hard data that proves rage comics are plummeting in popularity. If you've never heard of rage comics, be thankful. The cartoons bubbled up out of imageboard 4chan in 2008 before spreading like a crudely drawn cancer to Reddit and humor sites 9GAG and FunnyJunk, then popular culture at large. If you ever heard some use ""le"" or ""derp"" or ""herp"" or (shudder) ""sexytime"" in daily life, you can thank rage comics. There are rage comic T-shirts. Teachers use them as instructional tools. You could even insert the images in Facebook chat. The comics are essentially emoticons — a set of faces that represent common emotions and reactions — that users cobble together into stories using free ""rage making"" tools available online. That's not necessarily a recipe for intractable cultural sludge. In fact, there's something undeniably appealing about the creative democratization that rage comics represent, and there were some pretty funny examples of the form in its heyday. Take this example of astounding banality that currently sits on top of the subreddit:  The problem? Since 2009, rage comics have had their very own home (r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu) on Reddit, a site with the most ravenous hunger for new content on the planet. For three years Reddit's army of a half-million amateur cartoonists has worked nonstop, 24 hours a day, creating new comics at a breakneck speed. Necessarily, what quality there was has plummeted over that time. If The Simpsons should have ended after, say, the twelfth season, rage comics should have died out after their twelfth week. Instead, they reproduced with the speed and ferocity of a bacterial colony. But new data released by an r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu moderator show the subreddit is in the midst of a long decline. From February to December of last year, visits to the subreddit dropped by more than half, from 2.2 million to 1 million. Pageviews have plummeted even more, from an astonishing 37 million in February to a relatively measly 8 million in December. We aren't entirely sure why. It could be that a million people over the course of the last year just suddenly realized how awful rage comics had become. Or maybe, and more ominously, former rage comic aficionados have simply migrated elsewhere, to other forms of cheap, easy-to-produce entertainment. Have you heard of animated GIFs, for instance? They're apparently all the rage nowadays. Image via KnowYourMeme

Ahead of its appearance at CES in Las Vegas this week, Roku revealed Monday it has inked deals with a dozen video, gaming and music partners such as TWC TV, Blockbuster On Demand, FOX NOW, PBS, PBS KIDS, iHeartRadio and Big Fish Unlimited.  The biggest part of the news is for Time Warner Cable (TWC) subscribers. Later this quarter, TWC TV users can download an app that will provide them with 300 live TV channels directly from Roku. In effect, this turns into a second cable box. This is similar to the deal Comcast's Xfinity and Verizon FiOS signed with the Xbox 360. It's also similar to what Cablevision offers its customers via its iOS and Kindle Fire Optimum Online app. In effect, this is further blurring the line between content delivered over the air (OTA) and streamed over the top (OTT). The channels will launch in the Roku Channel Store early this year. Roku also announced new device partners for the Roku Streaming Stick, a product that allows people to easily update their existing smart TVs with Roku streaming content.

The company took the Android smartphone market by storm with the release of the Galaxy S III, and released the Galaxy Camera, a digital point-and-shoot camera that runs on Android. So, what does the company have in store for 2013? You can bet there will be a ton of home theater products, including a number of televisions â€“- maybe even a 4K TV, similar to the Ultra HD 4K TV shown off by Toshiba Sunday evening. We could also potentially see a new smartphone or two, or even a new tablet. Join Editor-in-Chief Lance Ulanoff and Reporter Emily Price at 2pm PT/ 5pm ET for a live blog documenting all the action.  Samsung's 2013 lineup of LED TVs are its brightest and slimmest yet. The bezel is just a quarter of an inch. This is 85-inches of 4K power. Samsung presented its press conference to a packed crowd. The Samsung NX300 is the world's first camera with an interchangeable 3D lens that shoots both stills and video. Samsung is offering an upgrade kit for its 2012 HDTVs to bring quad-core processing, better connectivity and a whole new interface. Editor-in-chief Lance Ulanoff and tech reporter Emily Price live blog the event. It's an ultra-thin, ultra-light, Ultrabook. The NX300 is Samsung's latest APS-CMOS Compact System Camera. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/samsung-85-inch-uhd-tv/,Samsung Intros 85-Inch UHD TV With a Quad-Core Processor Inside," LAS VEGAS — Samsung rolled out the world's largest 4K ultra-high definition TV (UHD TV) Monday at CES 2013, offering four times the resolution of 1080p high-definition displays.  Since there is hardly any 4K programming yet available, the Samsung  UN85S9000 UHD TV uses a quad-core processor to upscale 1080p programs to its lofty resolution.  The UN85S9000 adds unique features such as voice interaction that lets you control it by speaking to it in complete sentences, and Smart View that lets you stream content from your mobile devices to the TV screen. Perhaps the most remarkable feature announced for this product is its ability to link the TV with other Samsung smart home appliances. This feature will allow you to do gee-whiz things such as monitor your wash cycle (if you have a Samsung's smart home washing machine), or adjust your thermostat, all with an app that you can watch on screen without needing to pause the program you're viewing. The TV helps you find programs with Samsung's S-recommendation lists, which the company says will let you browse through thumbnails of  ""suggested content.""  Of course, those who might purchase this TV will be concerned about obsolescence of its internal processor and software, so Samsung included the smart evolution Connector, allowing users to upgrade as technology improves. It's a highly capable TV with an impressive features list, but what was missing? Perhaps the most important thing: the availability date and a price.

The company's 55-inch ""Real"" OLED TV is the first consumer television that literally lets two people watch two different shows simultaneously. How does it do such a thing? With a special muti-view feature, which adapts 3D technology to display a different image to the viewer depending on whether they're sitting to the left or the right of the screen. And yes, both will be at full 1080p resolution. The big catch, of course, is that each viewer has to wear special glasses to see the proper image, not to mention get the right sound. Samsung has developed a new kind of glasses that works with both 2D and 3D material, and includes a pair of headphones tuned to whichever ""channel"" you're watching. No price or availability yet on the KN55F9500, and it only comes in the 55-inch size — large for an OLED set, which are known for their thinner profiles and brighter displays. This set is also one of the first to pack a quad-core processor, a 1.35GHz chip based on ARM's Cortex-A15 architecture. What do you think of Samsung's multi-view TV?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/samsung-quad-core-tv/,Samsung Debuts World's First Quad-Core TV,"LAS VEGAS — Today's phones and tablets often have quad-core processors that enable them to handle a multitude of tasks. As TVs become integrated more and more with mobile devices, it only makes sense that they get in on the quad-core action, too, and Samsung just debuted what it claims is the worldâ€™s first quad-core TV. The LED/LCD model, the UN60F8000, is equipped with a 1.35GHz chip based on the ARM Cortex-A15 architecture. Besides making the set 3.6x as fast as last yearâ€™s dual-core TVs, the quad CPU enables it to handle all kinds of content, including material in the HEVC format, Samsung says. The new set also has Samsung's new Smart Hub UI, which funnels the multitude of content it can access — including live TV, on-demand video and apps — into five app-like tiles. With Smart View, you can relay whatever youâ€™re watching on a Samsung phone or tablet to the TV and back. The quad-core processor also helps with plenty of other features, including voice commands, the 2-megapixel front-facing camera, and a suite of picture enhancements such as ""Micro Dimming Ultimate,"" which optimizes the LED backlight for the best contrast, and an improved de-jagging algorithm for smoother lines. The quad-core TV (no price yet) is actually one of a pair, as Samsung's dual-view OLED set, which lets two people watch two different shows on the same TV simultaneously(!), boasts the same processor. It was just a matter of time for TVs to get the same kind of processing as mobile devices, which bodes well for them providing a better experience in the coming years.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/samsung-smart-hub/,Samsung Re-Invents the TV Interface to Include Social and Apps,"LAS VEGAS — Samsung really wants to be the company to define the future of TV. And since the TV is now home to so much more than just shows, Samsung has revamped the user interface of its smart TVs to reflect today's connected and social world. The Smart Hub UI — the TV's ""home screen"" — on all Samsung TVs going forward will be defined by five app-like tiles, each of which borrows heavily from mobile user interfaces: On TV: For live TV, this tile will display six thumbnail images that represent programs the TV recommends based on viewing patterns. There'll be a yellow progress bar underneath each to see how far each show has progressed. Video On Demand: The place for services like Netflix and Hulu Plus. Enter a title (either via text or voice), and the TV will show you all the options you have for viewing it. My Content: Once your TV is connected to your home network, you'll be able to see all your personal content (video, music and photo) here, across devices. Social: Here you'll find feeds from Twitter, Facebook and other services, which you'll be able to use to quickly connect with the online conversation about what you're watching. Apps: Download and run Smart TV apps (weather, stocks, et cetera) via this tile, where a recommendation engine will suggest new ones. Samsung says there are ""many"" video apps to choose from. Besides organizing your connected TV content into five buckets, Samsung's Smart Hub is designed to work with the new gesture and voice controls the company debuted in 2012. For example, the On Demand tile will respond to natural language like, ""I feel like a little Game of Thrones right now.""

Samsung's improving the second-screen abilities of its TVs, too, enabling them to mirror content down to other devices, including iPads and iPhones. Samsung phones and tablets can also ""mirror up"" content to the TV. Bought a Samsung TV last year and feel cheated out of this digital bonanza? You may remember that those TVs came with a spot for an ""Evolution Kit"" for hardware upgrades. Now we know what it's for — owners of 2012 Samsung TVs can upgrade to the new Smart Hub with the first Kit (model no. VG-SEK1000), coming in the first half of 2013 (no price announced). How do you like Samsung's new take on the TV? Thumbs up or thumbs down? Tell us in the comments. Photos by Mashable/Nina Frazier "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/samsung-uhd-blu-ray/,Samsung 'Premium' Blu-ray Player Does Ultra HD... Sort Of,"LAS VEGAS — Now that Ultra High-Definition TVs — which have 4x the number of pixels as 1080p sets — are a real thing, the question remains: Does anything exist that can actually play the format? Samsung says yes, offering up a ""premium"" Blu-ray player capable of serving up Ultra HD video ... with a catch. The catch is the video is actually upconverted from 1080p (or standard-def), not native 4K (the other term for Ultra HD). You can't really blame Samsung — since there isn't yet a consumer disc format for Ultra HD, there wasn't really a way to build a player that outputs 4K natively, at least not one that would be guaranteed to still work in a year. The player (model no. BD-F7500) also includes built-in Wi-Fi, letting it play material wirelessly from any DLNA-connected device, or even connect with other Samsung smart appliances. What to check if your laundry's done from your Blu-ray player? Now you can do that. Power all this future goodness is a 900MHz dual-core chipset, which also helps power Samsung S-Recommendation engine, which the company says is ""like a good friend who knows your interests,"" recommending content from all the sources it can connect to. Are you interested in a Ultra HD Blu-ray player that can only upconvert to the format? Let us know in the comments. Powerful yet fun DIY robotics for adults and children.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/sharp-intros-worlds-largest-led-hdtv/,Sharp Intros World's Largest LED HDTV,"LAS VEGAS — Sharp Electronics is trying to carve out a bigger piece of the super-sized HDTV market, unveiling 21 new 60-inch-and-above HDTVs at CES 2013. The models range from a 60-inch HDTV to the World's biggest, a 90-inch, room-filling LED HDTV. To put that in perspective, that's 4 feet tall and almost 7 feet wide. It's approximately 5 inches deep. The TV joins Sharp's growing Aquos line of HDTVs. The 141-pound monster ... er ... TV will still be stretching a 1080p resolution over all that expansive screen real estate.  Sharp, though, isn't leaving the Ultra-HD market behind.  It also unveiled its first 4K Ultra HD display, a 60-inch Aquos TV that employs I-cubed Research Center's ICC Purios technology. Sharp also boasted during its press conference that the TV's picture quality has been certified by THX (apparently a first for 4K TVs). It's should be noted, however, that Toshiba's new 4K Ultra HD set is a whopping 84 inches. Sharp offered no pricing details on the set, but said it should arrive in stores this summer. Not every 4K announcement at CES 2013 is a big one. Sharp also announced a new 32-inch 4K business display based on yet another technology: IZGO. You can learn more about it here.  Like most HDTV manufacturers, Sharp is not leaving 1080 behind (how could they? There's still no content for 4K displays). Today it announced three new Sharp Aquos Quattron (RGB and Yellow) 3D LEDs ranging in size from a 60-inch model for $3999.99 to the 80-inch LC-80LE857 for $6,499.99.  All three models will feature Active 3D (that's the kind that requires special, synced 3D glasses) Smart TV Wi-Fi and Web-browsing capability. These new models will also support split-screen use, which means you can watch live TV on one side and browse the Web on the other. Non-3D options will also available for all of these HDTVs, with prices ranging from $1,499.99 for the 60-inch model to $4,999.99 for an 80-inch HDTV. There are almost a dozen TVs in the Aquos line-up in a wide-range of pricing and feature options. Most of the new models will arrive sometime in Q1 of this year. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/sharp-unveils-next-gen-igo-hdtvs/,Sharp Unveils Next-Gen IGZO Displays,"LAS VEGAS — The U.S. is going to get its first taste of Sharp Electonics's IGZO display technology. The tech giant announced today at CES 2013 that it's bringing next-gen LED displays to the American market in 2013. IGZO, which stands for Indium Gallium Zinc Oxide, is actually a transparent, compound semi-conductor that Sharp says can replace the standard amorphous silicon material used for the active layer in thin-film transistors (TFTs) LED displays. The new display technology, which was introduced in Japan last year (in smartphones), offers, according to Sharp, of number of benefits over traditional LCD displays: It can support super-high resolutions. At CES, Sharp is demonstrating a new 32-inch 3,840 x 2,160 pixels (roughly 4x by 2x standard HD) touch-screen business monitor. The ultra-low-power display technology can actually maintain a screen image after it's been powered down. Sharp did not state how long the image would last. The new display technology also, Sharp says, lowers screen noise/interference introduced by touch technology.  To create the finished displays, which for now run from 4-to-32 inches diagonally, Sharp partnered with Corning Glass. The final LED business displays are 35mm thick. Sharp says that makes them the thinnest ""in their class."" IGZO monitors, however, are just the tip of the iceberg. Sharp executives anticipate IGZO will end up in everything from phones to countertops. You can get a glimpse of those future applications in the video below.  "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/social-media-iran/,Iran Reportedly Developing 'Intelligent Software' to Control Social Media Access,"Iran is reportedly developing ""intelligent software"" that will allow government officials to control access to social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter, letting Iranians access those networks in a government-approved fashion. The idea of the controlling software seems to be allowing Iranian citizens to use social media for government-approved purposes while prohibiting citizens from using it to spread messages of dissent or organize protests.  News of the software was first reported by a local Iranian outlet, then picked up by the Agence France-Presse. ""Smart control of social networks will not only avoid their disadvantages, but will also allow people to benefit from their useful aspects,"" police chief Esmaeil Ahmadi Moghadam told the 7Sobh daily as quoted by the AFP. ""The designing of intelligent software to control social networking websites"" is in the works, he added. SEE ALSO: Facebook Diplomacy: 'Israel Loves Iran' Pages Take Off
 Iran's ""online police"" have already been monitoring online communications since at least 2011. Iran's government has repeatedly blocked access to foreign services such as Gmail, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, though many Iranians use Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology to breeze past the barrier and get online. Twitter, among other networks, was a popular organizational and messaging tool during Iran's ""Green Revolution"" of 2009-2010. Iran has also been working on a ""national intranet"" for several months. The idea? Cut ties with the global Internet as much as possible while still preserving the ability to use Internet-style communications for doing business within the country. The United States, meanwhile, has been actively working to help Iranians get online. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's office recently set up a Facebook account.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/stolen-iphone-dating/,Man Recovers Stolen iPhone by Luring Thief Through Dating Site,"One of the unfortunate facts of the digital age we live in is that items such as iPhones are likely candidates to be stolen. Everyone wants the latest smartphone, tablet, computer or gadget from companies like Apple. So, when an iPhone is lost, chances are there's someone else out there fiddling with it.  That's what happened to Nadav Nirenberg this past New Year's Eve. He lost his phone, and another scurrilous individual decided to keep it. How did Nirenberg know someone had his phone? He received an email alert notifying him that the person had been messaging women through OkCupid on it. That's when things got interesting. Nirenberg created a fake OkCupid profile featuring a picture of a young, busty woman titled ""Jennifer in BK."" The fake woman, who he named Jennifer Gonzalez, then began messaging the unsuspecting thief. The crook suggested the two meet, to which Nirenberg quickly agreed and requested that they meet at an address that just so happens to be Nirenberg's apartment. As for how he convinced the thief that he was a lady, Nirenberg said, ""I used lots of winks and smiley faces so I would seem like a girl."" When the bandit showed up at Nirenberg's door, he was all decked out and ready for a date — even holding a bottle of wine. That's when Nirenberg tapped the man on the shoulder from behind, and brandished a hammer, before demanding the return of his phone. After a short exchange that involved Nirenberg giving the thief $20, the iPhone was recovered. As successful as this story seems, we don't suggest trying it at home. A hammer's not liable to stop someone who's really keen on keeping a stolen object. That said, anyone who has ever had something stolen from them can certainly take a little slice of justice away from Nirenberg's experience. [via NYPost] Image courtesy of Flickr, matthewthecoolguy

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/targus-touch-pen-windows-8/,Turn Your Windows 8 Laptop Into a Touchscreen Device With This Gadget,"LAS VEGAS — Want to turn your laptop or desktop running Windows 8 into a touchscreen device? Accessory company Targus announced on Monday morning at the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas a first-of-its kind technology that makes the most of the latest Windows operating system, without the need to splurge for a pricey new computer that touts the company's built-in touchscreen capabilities. Windows 8 — which launched in October and was designed for touch — allows users to swipe, slide and access a full collection of features via your finger. But because of the cost of new hardware, many Microsoft fans upgraded to Windows 8 without buying an expensive touch-screen PC. Now, the Targus Touch Pen aims to give anyone using Windows 8 on older hardware the touch experience, with the help of a stylus. ""Windows 8 is designed for touch, so if you have a current laptop and your device isn't capability for touch [sic], it lessens the value,"" Al Giazzon, VP of marketing and communications at Targus, told Mashable. ""We put together a new product that turns current computers into a touchscreen device that supports Windows 8. It's easy to use, cheaper and is smaller than the size of your thumb."" Here's how it works: A small receiver attaches to the side of the laptop screen and communicates with the black Touch Pen via a cable that connects to a USB port, so your laptop thinks it has a touchscreen. The Touch Pen acts like your finger would on a touchscreen, and the screen is protected with the stylus' soft tip. (Note: It doesn't work with an actual finger because it doesn't use either capacitive or optical touch tech).  SEE ALSO: | Windows 8 Is Bold and Powerful [REVIEW] |The Problem With Windows 8
 ""Anything you can do with a touch-screen device, you can now do with a laptop or desktop,"" Giazzon said. ""It also works with a laptop you bought years ago."" Even better, the Touch Pen doesn't require software or drivers, and only a one-time calibration is needed to set up the device and determine the measurements of the screen. It works with any computer with Windows 8 and monitors up to 17 inches (so larger all-in-ones are out). Meanwhile, the company said it patented the technology that simulates the touch experience with a stylus for Windows 8 devices, which may ward off other manufacturers looking to get into the space.  The Touch Pen will ship later this month and be available via Targus.com and various retailers, including Best Buy and Amazon. What do you think of the Touch Pen?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/ticketmaster-inauguration/,Didn't Get Obama Inauguration Tickets? Blame Ticketmaster,"Looking for tickets to President Barack Obama's inaugural ball or parade? You may be out of luck, thanks to a Ticketmaster email snafu.  Ticketmaster began selling tickets to the presidential inaugural ball and parade on Sunday following an e-mail invitation to customers — but they weren't supposed to be available until Monday morning, per earlier White House statements. In a follow-up email to customers sent late Sunday, the company said the invitation to buy tickets was a misfire. ""During testing of our email system tonight, you may have inadvertently received an invitation to purchase tickets for 2013 Inauguration events, including the Inaugural Ball or the Inaugural Parade,"" read the follow-up from Ticketmaster. ""Public tickets to these events were originally scheduled to go on sale tomorrow morning — you received the email tonight in error, and Ticketmaster takes responsibility for this mistake."" That email said ""a significant number"" of the available public tickets were gone, but Ticketmaster's website currently shows zero tickets available — meaning all the tickets are likely gone. It went on to say that tickets are ""first-come, first-served"" including ""those sold tonight.""  Translation: If you were waiting for Monday morning to snatch up your inaugural ball or parade tickets and didn't see the errant Sunday email, you're likely out of luck, beaten to the punch by those who checked their inboxes.  Mashable's Jeremy Cabalona, who managed to get inaugural ball and parade tickets on Sunday, said that the process was far from smooth. Instead, it involved a cat-and-mouse game of refreshing Ticketmaster's page in the hopes that it would switch from ""sold out"" to ""available,"" which in his case it did after approximately three hours. Sunday's first Ticketmaster email, the invitation to buy inaugural ball and parade tickets, said the following: ""The Presidential Inaugural Committee is pleased to offer you the opportunity to attend the Inaugural festivities. This email contains the information you'll need to join us here in Washington, D.C., for the official Inaugural events. This email contains specific information for your access to Inaugural tickets. Below, please find a link, your account number and account password for our secure ticketing website. You can access your tickets and input your address and billing information from the link."" Obama's inauguration ceremony is set for Jan. 21. Tickets for the ceremony itself are available through members of Congress. Mashable has reached out to Ticketmaster and will update this post with any response. Did you lose out on tickets because of Ticketmaster's early email? Share in the comments.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/toshiba-4k-tv/,Toshiba Shows Off Its New 84-inch Ultra HD 4K TV,"LAS VEGAS —  At a private press event Sunday evening, Toshiba gave us a first look at its upcoming line of Ultra HD 4K TVs. The L9300 series is headlined by an 84-inch model (pictured above), but also includes a 58 and 65-inch set. The 4K format gives you four times the pixel resolution of a standard 1080p Full-HD television, offering a picture at a 3,840 x 2,160 pixels. Televisions in Toshiba's 4K series use its own CEVO 4K Quad + Dual Core Processor, which is what converts standard 1080p content to the 4K resolution without creating any artifacts in the process.  The processor makes it possible to take traditional 1080p content, for instance a Blu-ray disk, and then view that content at a near-4K resolution despite the fact that it was not originally created at that resolution. The processor also boosts the video's contrast. The televisions in the series also take advantage of the Toshiba's new Cloud TV platform, which was also shown off Sunday evening. The Cloud TV platform gives users access to features such as Skype calling, personal messaging, a family event calendar and streaming news. The L9300 series of Ultra HD 4K televisions is expected to ship this summer for a yet-to-be-announced price. Powerful yet fun DIY robotics for adults and children.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/traffic-signals-bugs/,Traffic Signals Inspired by Bugs,"Why does it always seem that when there's no traffic, a stop light is too long and when there's tons of traffic, a stop light is too short?  Managing the flow of cars is a big challenge for many urban planners. Ozan Tonguz, a telecommunications researcher from Carnegie Mellon, has examined the way ants and termites navigate their own versions of gridlock to create Virtual Traffic Lights, an algorithm that helps control human traffic on busy streets. SEE ALSO: See How Purchases Directly Impact Climate Change
 It's called a ""virtual"" traffic lights because instead of the lights being at intersections, they're located in each car, on windshield. The algorithm uses information collected from GPS devices, short-range communicators and other sensors to manage whether a driver sees a green, yellow or red light on her windshield. In simulations, the algorithm managed the flow of cars in a way similar to how insects manage themselves. In ant and terminte colonies, the large group always gets to go first. ""In such self-organizing biological systems, the colony can perform all the vital functions it needs (such as foraging, moving, adjusting to changing environmental conditions, protecting itself from predators, etc.) through the cooperation of the members of its colony,"" Tonguz explained in an email to DNews. As soon as the biggest group cleared out, the next group was allowed to go. Through the simulations, the scientists found that traffic drive time was reduced for urban commuters by 40-60%. The newest set of algorithms being tested will also take into account pedestrians and cyclists in the flow of traffic. The project has already garnered $2 million in funding from private groups and the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration since 2009. Large scale testing is slated to start this year, and if it becomes a reality, you'll have those pesky little ants on your sidewalk to thank for your shorter and less stressful commute.

""Our world has clearly changed, so we want to reflect those cultural and technological changes in each of the many ways that consumers now touch the VH1 brand.""  The new logo, for example, appears on the bottom right of this promo ad for The Jenny McCarthy Show, with the plus sign integrated separately into the ad art as well:  The plus sign is meant to mesh VH1's music, pop culture and nostalgia content together. VH1 calls the plus sign a ""tagmark"" and says it represents the brand's ""high-energy sensibility where everything is 'more' — more fun, more bold, and more exciting.""

But that's an attitude YouTube is desparate to change — and TV makers are eager to help them out. A number of sets launching at CES 2013 this week in Las Vegas — including sets from Bang & Olufsen, LG, Panasonic and Sony — offer the video service's recently launched ""send to TV"" feature.  This lets you pair an Android phone with a TV on the same Wi-Fi network, and cue up videos using the YouTube app as your remote. Sony and Samsung apps on some recently-sold TVs already work with the feature, as do TV apps on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii and Wii U consoles. Google TV not required. (Controls in the iOS YouTube app are coming soon.) And all of that is just the tip of the iceberg. During interviews at YouTube HQ in San Bruno, Calif., the company tried its best to convince Mashable that a Minority Report-style future — one where the majority of us will simply flick videos off our phone screens and have them appear on our TVs, without a second thought — was just around the corner.  ""We're trying to build this infrastructure that scales everywhere from watching 1080p HD-quality video on your TV all the way down to using a dial-up modem in a developing country,"" says Shiva Rajaraman, YouTube director of product management. ""We'd like to be all things video, and that means getting video into all places"" — with your smartphone replacing your remote or your game controller.   It also means turning YouTube into more of a DVR. The company hopes to persuade you to treat YouTube as a primetime, evening watching experience, rather than something you use for cat videos at work.  In this effort, YouTube has a major ally — its audience. The service already experiences a boom in viewers every evening in every time zone in America. ""We see traffic spike on the smartphone, tablet, and TV-connected UIs,"" says Rajaraman. ""Prime time is prime time everywhere, for YouTube too."" Though YouTube doesn't offer any numbers, a big chunk of this primetime spike is likely to be second-screen watching. You've got the TV on in the background, but you just got reminded of the really cool video that got passed around the office.  So what do you do? Reach for the tablet, grab the laptop, pull the phone out of your pocket. Why? Because they seem like the best screens for the job.  If you're anything like me, you already have the ability to watch YouTube on your TV, along with Hulu Plus, Netflix and Amazon Prime. But you don't do it because experience has taught you the result is likely to suffer by comparison with those other services.  The big streaming companies offer a pretty consistent video experience. Load a movie on Netflix streaming, and you know it's going to seem somewhere between DVD and Blu-Ray quality.  Load a YouTube video on the big screen, and there's a chance the quality could appear somewhere between an 8-bit video game and a fuzzy LEGO art project. There's not a whole lot YouTube can do about that; it's the one truly democratic, worldwide video network. Quality of uploads is bound to be all over the map. So how to overcome our wariness of using YouTube on the TV? During our conversations, I suggested the service start verifying accounts, Twitter-style — you get a tick next to your name if you consistently post videos that look great on a 42-inch screen, say. (Because as we know from experience, simply saying a video is HD when you upload it doesn't make it so.) You could also use the verification process to clamp down on one of YouTube's most terrible scourges: the vertical video.  The YouTube team demurred. They're leery of encouraging user behavior in that direct a manner. For example, there are plenty of times the service can see there's a problem with your video playing, and can make an educated guess as to why. There have been discussions behind the scenes about having a dialogue box pop up telling you, for example, that you might want to quit the 10 other programs you have running. ""We don't want to add to the confusion, or look like we're pointing fingers,"" says Andy Berkheimer, YouTube's head of engineering. ""If you suggest the user take action and say it's something else's fault, you have to be sure."" Having said that, he adds, ""We've definitely identified a few scenarios where we can help people out."" Still, YouTube's focus is mostly on fixing its video service on the back end. An ongoing internal project code-named ""Sliced Bread"" has made the whole service a lot smarter about how it feeds video to you, chopping it up into slices much the same way regular internet content is divided into packets, and making a half-dozen other software and bandwidth adjustments on the fly. ""The goal is to get rid of the spinner,"" says Berkheimer, referring to the rotating series of dots that shows when a YouTube video is loading. The server software is ""making decisions about next five to 10 seconds, asking: how do I provide highest quality with lowest risk of inducing a spinner?"" Getting a spinner, in fact, is the number one predictor of whether you're going to abandon your YouTube video and move on to something else. So if you've found that your videos have started playing more smoothly with fewer interruptions recently, thank sliced bread.  YouTube apps on Samsung and Sony sets sold within the last year will start updating themselves with improvements to the service, as they're now controlled by YouTube rather than the manufacturers. You'll also find that if you're watching a lot of videos on TV, the apps will know that and start offering more HD videos to you.  ""If you only watch HD on your TV, you shouldn't have to go and toggle some settings switch in order to do that,"" says Rajaraman. Ultimately, none of this matters unless the content creators start viewing their stuff as TV-ready. Which is why YouTube is encouraging the whole concept of Channels and Subscriptions. On both the user and creator side, the plan is to turn the millions of YouTube Channels — whichever ones float your boat — into must-see TV. Developers are part of the bigger picture, too. The company is also releasing updates to its API with a mobile embeddable player, allowing more apps to take advantage of YouTube content. Ultimately, YouTube will rise or fall on what creators do with it. It isn't trying to be Hulu or Netflix; there are no major deals for movies or cable content on the horizon. Whether it can compete with those services for your TV-based attention is up to you. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/07/youtube-vs-cable/,The Imaginary War: Why Cable and YouTube Should Coexist,"Traditional television and YouTube have been at war for what seems like years now. So who's winning?  Neither. At least not yet. YouTube struggles with quality and regularity, while TV networks still scramble to decipher the Internet. Both must accept that they are really two different ecosystems, and people want both. SEE ALSO: Inside YouTube's Plan to Dominate Your TV
 YouTube has grown wildly in seven years thanks in large part to its openness. It's been a place for the users, by the users. But every tech company has to grow up and make money, and this is YouTube's moment. Many have speculated the video juggernaut could become Television 2.0, putting traditional media in danger. But this battle for the future of video might not be so epic. We need to stop making either side feel like they need to compete for our attention.  Cable television is not going anywhere — at least not anytime soon. The majority of Americans are still watching television — an average of four hours and 39 minutes per day, according to Brian Stelter at the New York Times. The difference is how and when they watch it. Fewer people are tuning into shows as they air. Multi-tasking, mobile Millennials might not even watch an entire show on-demand.  This is why cable needs YouTube in the digital age. Most of the biggest moments in television — be they live, late night, morning talk shows, sketch comedy, reality television — are captured and shared online. They are the juicy pieces that carry the show from a traditional audience to social viewers. Most networks understand this is now critical, and will only grow in importance. Rather than finding a solution to piracy, networks need to stop sweating over losing viewers to online video and find a way to make it work. If they don't find a way to quickly and easily distribute content online, someone else will. YouTube itself plays nice by improving the TV experience for those who watch videos on a big screen. Most networks have found success on YouTube by adding small segments before or during a show's airing. Showtime released episodes of Dexter and Homeland on YouTube in conjunction with its television premiere. The network has since made those videos private, but it's a step in the right direction. Jimmy Kimmel goes as far as using YouTube to get users involved in the show, ultimately providing free programming and more viewership. Some networks have attempted to bridge the digital gap by bringing YouTube shows to television. The most recent example would be Recipe Rehab's jump to ABC, while maintaining its presence online. A cooking show might be a rare example that actually works, because it's already a reference tool. People watching the show are more inclined to find the recipe online. Television networks benefit from this portability because web shows can prove their following. Take The Annoying Orange, a series of viral videos that was picked up by Comedy Central. This was already a marketable franchise before Viacom risked a penny producing it for television. YouTube is a valuable part of the news cycle, especially in 2012. The Weather Channel's continuous live stream of Hurricane Sandy coverage had 13 million views. Videos tagged ""Obama"" or ""Romney"" were watched 2.7 billion times. Felix Baumgartner's daredevil space jump was viewed live by 8 million people — beating Discovery Channel's live broadcast, which served 7.6 million people. As more people use YouTube, record numbers will continue to break. Traditional media simply cannot ignore online numbers anymore Not every YouTube channel is a fit for television, but most online producers would still consider jumping to traditional media the ultimate success.   Many YouTube stars have relied on traditional media to jump-start their web-based career. When Billy Eichner does a segment on Conan, a simple plug brings hundreds of new viewers from TV to his online presence, including his YouTube channel. It can take a YouTube personality years to organically build a following large enough to make a living from. There is and will continue to be great content made on YouTube. The best stuff is made by and for YouTubers. That's arguably YouTube's biggest strength — empowering people make their own content and decide what's worth watching. In 2012, YouTube invested $100 million in 100 premium channels, leading many to believe it was taking on the traditional entertainment industry. Only 30 to 40% of those contracts are being renewed, but a larger question has yet to be answered. Why would the company cannibalize its own user base? Rather than serving as an amazing tool that allows users to make wonderful things, YouTube wants to be a part of content creation.  This competition within has sparked a trend in production studios, which the company supports in small partnership. These studios help manage and produce channels that have typically reached a significant amount of followers — usually people who work on YouTube channels full-time. The YouTube Space, the company's most recent endeavor, is a physical studio area where YouTube creators can network, create content and rent equipment. It's a cool idea, except I have to live in Los Angeles to utilize it.  What used to be a platform that leveled the playing field is now investing in traditional media practices. If YouTube does not accept itself as a platform, and allow video makers complete creative control, creatives may be less inclined to host videos on the site. Future generations are digital natives — if they don't like something online, they'll figure out how to make a better version. It's the same reason YouTube ""disrupted"" the television industry in the first place: more access, less rules. This might explain why YouTube opened the exclusive Partner Program to everyone last year. In order to become a partner, you no longer have to be a celebrity or garner a million views — just enable your account and successfully monetize at least one of your videos. It's the least intrusive way to provide a solid platform and still make a profit.  Nearly every video on YouTube now has an ad before it, but the company managed to minimize ad time by implementing the ""skip ad"" feature. Users can skip ads on 65% of videos. This small act of consideration for user experience is how YouTube disrupted traditional media in the first place. Put users first. The relationship between YouTube and television is vital. As devices and streaming become more accessible and more mobile, people will continue to find ways to view their favorite shows and create new content. Image courtesy of Flickr, smokeghost "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/08/artist-drone-pilots-craigslist-fbi/,"Artist Looks for Drone Pilots on Craigslist, Gets Threatened by FBI"," An Israeli filmmaker attracted the attention of the FBI when he posted an ad on Craigslist, looking for U.S. drone pilots. While doing some research for his short film about drone strikes, 5,000 Feet Is The Best, Omer Fast posted an anonymous ad looking to talk to pilots based at Creech Air Force Base, one of the main bases where pilots remotely operate the flying bots from ground control stations (see the picture below).  That's when the FBI called. ""We were told to stop what we were doing and threatened in suggestive, spy-movie language,"" Fast told UK magazine Photoworks. The FBI was able to trace the ad back to Fast and his production team even though the ad was anonymous.  ""I imagine it's probably quite a routine thing for them to do but it sure took us by surprise because they had to trace our phone number via the IP address used to publish an otherwise anonymous ad on Craigslist,"" Fast told The Verge. SEE ALSO:  Student Tweets Entire History of US Drone Strikes
 The FBI's intervention didn't stop production, but it had some undesirable effects. ""After the call, our contacts went dead,"" said Fast. In the end though, he was able to republish the ad and he didn't have any issues when he landed in the United States.  The 30-minute film is not intended to be a documentary. Although it is based on two interviews with a real drone operator, the film also casts an actor to depict the operator, telling his story with flashbacks and fictional scenes reproducing drone strikes.  Watch the video above to find out more about this story.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/08/japanese-cat-bomb-hacker/,Japanese Cat Carries Clues to Bizarre Bomb Hacker Case,"Japan's central law enforcement agency has collared a cat — but not just any cat. This particular feline carried a memory card police say is the latest clue in a bizarre chase for a hacker who's used his stealthy computer skills to send anonymous bomb threats to schools, airlines and shopping malls. Following hints sent to media outlets on New Year's Day, the cat carrying the card was found on an island near Tokyo, Agence France-Presse reported. The card attached to its collar contained information that could have only been known by the creator of malware, dubbed the ""remote control virus,"" that the hacker uses to remotely control other people's computers, Japan's National Police Agency (NPA) said. Cat and Mouse For several months, Japanese police have been frustrated by a series of threatening messages posted to public forums and emailed to media organizations. Joji Hamada of Symantec's Security Response blog wrote that the threats have included promises to kill shoppers in a mall, blow up a religious shrine and bomb a passenger jet. The lack of an arrest, combined with one high-profile threat the hacker made against a school attended by Emperor Akihito's grandchildren, have caused the NPA much embarrassment. In December, the NPA, similar to the FBI, announced a bounty of more than $34,000 for information leading to the hacker's capture. The agency called upon the public to be on the lookout for someone with knowledge of the C# programming language and an ability to conduct online activities anonymously. However, as Wired News UK pointed out, since those skills are quite common among computer programmers, the public appeal did little to narrow down a list of potential suspects. Remote Control Symantec's analysis of the ""remote control virus"" showed that it wasn't anything special, other than being partly written in Japanese. The company noted that the infection rate was very low and that behavior-monitoring anti-virus software would block the malware. This past fall, authorities told the public that they had confessions from four suspects in custody. But when the threatening messages continued without abatement, the police were embarrassed even further. It turned out that the suspects' computers had indeed been infected with the ""remote control virus,"" which let the operator remotely email and post threats from other people's computers, masking the authentic source of the malicious messages.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/08/nfl-arian-foster-twitter-avatar/,NFL Star Uses Twitter Avatar to Send Trash Talk Message,"Did NFL star Arian Foster just make Twitter avatars the new locker-room bulletin board?  ""Bulletin-board material"" is a staple of the sports cliche lexicon,  right up there with ""taking it one game at a time"" and ""giving 110%."" It refers to when an upcoming opponent, or a media member — or pretty much anyone — says something disrespectful that can be used as motivation for a future matchup. The quote gets tacked up on the physical — or, more often, just metaphorical — locker-room bulletin board to be seen over and over again as fuel for the competitive fire.  Now, back to Arian Foster. The Houston Texans' star running back took exception to an article written by Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy. In the piece, Shaughnessy dismisses the Texans as playoff contenders, and characterizes the Patriots' matchup against them this Sunday as essentially a week off.  So Foster took a portion of the column and, with no fan fare, announcement or public comment, made it his Twitter avatar. Here's his avatar now:   Foster has long been among the most active, engaging and entertaining NFL players on Twitter, so it's no big surprise that he'd be the one to do something like this. Still, it's a pretty clever way to use Twitter, and provides a little bit of fun entertainment for fans during the week of hype before the game — much like when cornerback Richard Sherman changed his name on Twitter before another anticipated matchup earlier this season.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/08/personal-for-education/,Apply for Scholarships in a Flash With 'Personal for Education' App,"Filling out scholarship forms is easier when you don't have to write your basic information over and over again. ""Personal for Education"" is a web and mobile app that lets you store all of your basic information and populate online applications, making the process faster.   Personal.com can store and share all kinds of personal information — your birth certificate, passport, passwords, driver's license number and more. This new offering simplifies the college scholarship and financial-aid application process by saving students valuable time. Personal, along with a small number of private companies, promised to help students and future students make use of their college information — from details about classes you've taken to federal financial aid (FAFSA) information.  Almost a year ago, the government announced the ""My Data Button"" initiative. On the government website, users would click a button to access all their student information. Now, the MyDataButton plan has been scratched, but students can still access their records and import them into Personal. Here's how: First, users must request their personal information from the National Student Loan Database System website (the link is also available when you log into Personal). Once they receive that information, they can log into Personal and import the data. From there you can populate any form quickly with that information and avoid tedious typing.   Shane Green, Personal CEO and co-founder, uses the story of a college student named Alfredo. In a video, Alfredo explains his busy schedule — work, class, an internship plus school. Filling out numerous FAFSA and scholarship forms takes up much needed time. With Personal's data platform, he's able to upload his education data (downloaded from the Department of Education), and can insert it into numerous online forms by clicking the Personal button, which automatically populates all the correct fields. Another video shows the steps Alfredo takes to do this (this is a helpful how-to).   The service is free to use. The mobile apps are also free and available for iOS [iTunes link] and Android devices.  The other two private companies utilizing this release of data are Microsoft and a company called Parchment. Microsoft mimicked its HealthVault site to create the Lifelong Learning Record (LLR), a cloud-based storage solution for your personal education data. This is more for parents or students who want to keep a private, online record of their accomplishments. This could be used instead of putting poems and pictures in a box in the closet, or storing important achievements that can be used when applying for jobs.  Parchment allows students to build a digital record of their transcripts and achievements, and share those with colleges or employers. Students can see their chances of admission at various colleges once they upload their data.  Do you think Personal for Education would allow you to apply for more scholarships or save time?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/08/samsung-curved-oled/,Samsung Shows Off Curved OLED TV,"LAS VEGAS — You're not seeing things: This TV from Samsung has a slight curve to it. The company claims it's the world's first curved OLED TV, and we don't doubt it. What advantage does a curved TV have over flat panels? Samsung says the curves gives panoramic images such as nature scenes a more life-like viewing experience. A curved panel would theoretically also make viewing angle less of an issue, since the curve would bend pixels slightly toward the user. That would be more of an advantage for LCD TVs, however, which tend to lose color saturation at off angles, than OLEDs, which don't. Samsung's Curved OLED is just a concept right now, with no plans to bring it to market at the moment. Do you think a TV with a slight curve would improve your picture?

Announced at CES 2013, the app uses context-aware technologies to bring specific information to users at specific times. When the app launches at the end of January, fans will be able to get special Star Trek Into Darkness content, such as videos, photos and wallpaper delivered directly to the mobile device. That sort of functionality is standard fare for promotional apps for tentpole films. To kick things up a notch, the Star Trek Into Darkness app will also be able to unlock exclusive content and interactive features. The first opportunity to unlock content will come during the second quarter of the Super Bowl during an airing of a Star Trek Into Darkness TV spot. The app will use audio recognition to deliver content to users watching the ad on Super Bowl Sunday.  Leading up to the release of the film, the app will continue to unlock new surprises and features. It will also use image scan functionality to interact with printed images and billboards for the film. Additionally, there are going to be location-based experiences within the app. While using a smartphone app during a Super Bowl ad isn't totally new, this is the first time we've seen such a broad-based digital campaign built into a smartphone app. Star Trek Into Darkness opens in theaters May 17, 2013.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/08/star-wars-episode-vii-who-will-direct-it-now/,Star Wars Episode VII: Who Will Direct it Now?,"Is there a director on this planet who's up to the monumental task — and the potential fan backlash — of helming the as-yet-untitled Star Wars Episode VII? Or is the risk of disappointing rabid fans around the world, the legions who dressed up in character for the supposed Mayan apocalypse last month (such as the guy pictured above, at a rally in Kiev) just too great for any aspiring director to throw years of his or her life into the project?  The first Disney-produced episode in the Lucasfilm franchise is due in 2015. A great screenwriter, Michael Arendt (Toy Story 3, Little Miss Sunshine) has written a treatment that covers the brand new trilogy. But fans are starting to get a little nervous at the number of equally great directors that have ruled the project out. The latest to join the ""no thanks"" list is also the first we know of to have turned down a direct request from Lucasfilm. Guillermo del Toro, the Mexican director behind the darkly brilliant child's nightmare Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy, was the first choice of many Star Wars fans looking for something a little more Empire Strikes Back-ish than the prequel movies.  As revealed by indie blog The Playlist Monday, when del Toro's agent got the call, the director decided he was too busy — but added that he was very flattered to be asked.  He's a big fan himself, but ""I think the fans deserve somebody that is just going to immerse themselves completely,"" he said. Del Toro suggested that Brad Bird, who made his name over at Disney-owned Pixar, should direct the project, echoing many more fans' wishes. Many, many fan's wishes. Why? If you have to ask, watch this:  Bird, of course, has already ruled himself out. He laid a careful series of tweets informing us that he was directing a science fiction movie instead, 1952 with George Clooney. But he was flattered to be thought of, and told us he would be first in line to see Episode VII in 2015. Other directors who've been flattered but unavailable include Steven Spielberg (it's ""not his genre"" and he's too close to Lucas) and J.J. Abrams (he prefers to keep working on the Star Trek series). Watchmen director Zack Snyder likes the idea but thinks another Star Wars is a ""slippery slope,"" and Quentin Tarantino could ""so care less"" with Disney's name behind the project.  Why are so many big names turning down the opportunity to direct the next in a $4 billion series of live action films that changed movies forever, with built-in name recognition and audiences in the hundreds of millions? Try asking the last guy who signed up for the job, and who ""totally immersed himself"" in the franchise: George Lucas.  ""Why would I make any more when everybody yells at you all the time and says what a terrible person you are?"" Lucas asked the New York Times when announcing his retirement from Star Wars — indeed, from directing any major movie — back in January 2012.   The prequel trilogy was an enormous hit at the box office. The Phantom Menace alone made more money than the original, A New Hope. But the backlash from critics, and from many of the franchise's most rabid fans, has clearly taken its toll on Lucas.  SEE ALSO: Star Wars Just Got a New Lease on Life And no wonder. I dare you to think of any other director who has been so frequently accused of ""raping"" his fans' ""childhood."" Never mind Darth Vader; there's definitely a Dark Side to Star Wars fandom. On paper, the prequel trilogy should have been amazing. It had a clear story arc, a terrific list of actors at its disposal, and the best special effects team on the planet. It was a huge hit with kids. The trailers drove an older generation of fans into a frothing frenzy.  But the director's vision didn't sync up with their expectations. Scenes that seemed great in his head fell flat with audiences. What director is confident enough to stand up and say his or her vision will succeed, when there are significant odds that it won't?  For now, speculation seems to have settled on Matthew Vaughn, director of the gritty Layer Cake and the solid superhero flick that blended fact and fiction in the Cuban Missile Crisis, X-Men First Class. One of his actor friends let slip that Vaughn was in the running, and the director himself hasn't said one way or the other. But Vaughn is currently signed up to direct another comic book adaptation, The Secret Service. And if Disney did have a deal with Vaughn, chances are the studio would have let us know by now. The speculation game isn't, as it turns out, great for the Star Wars brand.  The more major directors are asked in the media if they'd be interested, the more there's a chance they will politely refuse — and the more Episode VII will gain a reputation as a potentially toxic project.  If not Del Toro, Bird or Vaughn, then who is best for the job? Who could best withstand fan scrutiny? Give us your suggestion in the comments.  Photo Credit: AFP/Getty Images "

With the program, customers will be able to access the web from their device, straight out of the box, for free. Every device comes with 200MB of data included for two years from the purchase date, with additional contract-free data available for purchase if and when they need it. 1GB of data, for instance, will be an additional $10.  'We're trying to really challenge the model of contracts –- and provide a delightful, easy experience for customers,"" T-Mobile's Brad Duea told Mashable. Traditionally, devices with built-in data have higher price tags at the store, and often require customers to sign a contract for data to be used on the device.  In this instance, data is available to anyone who purchases the product, regardless of whether they are a T-Mobile customer. The first devices supporting the service include Windows 8 notebooks and Ultrabooks from Dell and HP, specifically the Dell Inspiron 14z and HP Pavillion dm1is. The HP computer is available at Target and on HP.com and the Dell computer is available at Dell.com. In the future, T-Mobile plans to add additional units as well as partners such as Best Buy.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/08/t-mobile-value-plan/,T-Mobile to Expand Value Plans and Let You Upgrade Early,"LAS VEGAS — T-Mobile originally launched its value plans in September 2011 and Tuesday it announced plans to move all of its devices to the Value plan model. Most phones you purchase at a carrier are subsidized by that carrier. What that means is you might get a $600 phone for $200, with the carrier picking up the tab for the leftover $400 of the device's purchase price. “We’re not a big fan of the subsidy model,” T-Mobile's Brad Duea told Mashable.  “We think the value plan is a better model for the customer, because it's more transparent: here’s the price for your device and for your service.” With the value plans, phones will be available for a low, out-of-pocket price, with T-Mobile covering the remaining cost of that device but asking you to pay it back over time through an interest-free loan of sorts.  Once your phone is paid off, then you're no longer under contract for that device. If you want to get a new phone, you can simply pay off your old one and be eligible for an upgrade. T-Mobile isn’t announcing when it will be at 100% on the plans. Starting Jan. 9, customers will be able to purchase the LG Optimus L9 for $199.99 with no contract and score unlimited data, text and voice for $70 a month.

What you may not realize is the rap superstar is also the majority owner and CEO of the company making them. 2013 marks 50’s third CES, his second with his company SMS Audio, which manufacturers high-end headphones and earbuds. Unlike other artists who have their own line of audio products, 50 is a key decision maker in the company, and has control over every step of the process — from the audio quality of the headphones to their design and packaging.  One big business decision he’s made is to partner with FeedAmerica, a charity that helps feed the underprivileged in the United States. Every set of headphones sold provides 250 meals through that program. We caught up with 50 on the CES show floor and spoke to him for a few minutes about what 2013 has in store for his company. Check out the interview above, and let us know in the comments what you think his company should make next. Photos by Mashable "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/amazon-predictions-2013/,So What's Up for Amazon in 2013?,"Among the Gang of Four in tech right now — Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon — Amazon is the only business that revolves around content. The company's hardware products are basically buying machines. Amazon is dabbling with advertising as a potentially profitable side business, but that's not where it's heart is.  At bottom, Amazon really just wants to sell you stuff. Despite this guiding principle, analysts expect Amazon to continue clashing with at least two of the three predominant ecosystems in 2013. Inevitably, in order to grow you just have to get into new areas that have already been colonized by someone else.  In 2013, that may mean the first-ever Amazon Phone. Such a device has been rumored for years at this point, but then again, so was an Amazon tablet. Like the Kindle Fire, an Amazon Phone would likely house an Android-based platform customized by Amazon (hence, ""Amdroid"") that would unify disparate apps like Kindle, the Amazon Appstore Amazon MP3, Amazon Instant Video and the Amazon shopping app. To sweeten the offer, Amazon could, as Sascha Segan at PC Magazine suggests, subsidize carriers' data plans.  As mentioned, an Amazon Phone would merely be the latest manifestation of the company's overall strategy, which is to make buying on the platform as easy as possible. While we often think of cardboard boxes when we talk of buying on Amazon, increasingly commerce means streams of data, as well.  SEE ALSO: 5 Marketing Predictions for 2013 Tablets and a possible phone are two ways of lengthening Amazon's reach, but the company is characteristically looking beyond the obvious and finding creative new platforms. One such (ahem) vehicle is Ford's SYNC AppLink, which has now been joined with Amazon's Cloud Player. So for $24.99 a year, you can store up to 250,000 songs in the cloud and use voice control in SyncAppLink to call up your favorite tunes while you're driving.  Like mobile computing, TV presents another fat target for increased colonization. Though Amazon's streaming video business appears to be a placeholder at the moment, rather than a serious Netflix competitor, it would be naive to think that CEO Jeff Bezos isn't burning calories thinking of a way to get Amazon on more TVs.  The company was rumored to have been thinking of buying Roku. Assuming that never comes to pass, an Amazon set-top box is certainly a possibility. Of course, developing a viable living room device is easier said than done. Among the Gang of Four, only Apple has managed to build a decent TV streaming device. Even the mighty Google failed to match that feat with its dead-on-arrival Nexus Q last year.  Amazon is clearly a new kind of beast. It's not a traditional retailer but one with the power to kill off traditional brick-and-mortar retailing. Its main business isn't hardware, but it's shown it can compete there, as well. It's not a media company, but has the power to push around the major book publishers.  Finally, Amazon possesses the cloud computing heft to be a backbone for many of the web's top sites, including Reddit, Airbnb and Netflix.  Noah Elkin of eMarketer points out that Amazon has become the back-end host for many web businesses, as well. ""The cloud infrastructure is going to continue to be a bigger component of their business,"" says Elkin. ""It seems like an outlier for what Amazon does."" Indeed, Amazon's cloud business has become so prevalent that even competitors like Netflix rely on it, sometimes to their detriment.  With its stronghold on the retail business and the benefit of a relatively young, visionary CEO who puts growth ahead of quarterly profits, Amazon enjoys fairly unrestrained ambitions.  However, one area the company seems willing to cede is social networking. Perhaps Amazon has come to the same conclusion as Apple: that it doesn't pay to try to compete in social media. Of the Gang of Four, only one — Google — is competing in every major arena — advertising, hardware, media and social media. Perhaps Google is overreaching. A holiday 2012 survey by Baynote showed that two-thirds of consumers go directly to Amazon for price comparisons, rather than to Google. If Google continues to cede ground to Amazon and let the company become the online price checker of record, then Google+ will look like a misdirection of resources and Bezos will once again appear one step of ahead of the competition.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/apple-phablet/,Apple Refuses to Make the Device That's Taking Over the World,"One category of mobile device will blow away all others in the pace of its growth, expanding 70% in each of the next three years and yielding a $135 billion market by the end of 2015. Vendors will move 142 million units of this device in 2013 and up to 402 million by 2015, project analysts at Barclays. That's more than three times the number of iPhones sold in 2012. And, oh yeah, Apple doesn't make one of these. It's called a phablet. As in, an extra-large phone that's almost as big as a tablet, combining aspects of both. Phablet is the terrible name granted to this class of 5-inch and larger phones by a derisive press corps, which mocked one of the earliest and most visible examples of this trend, Samsung's 5.3-inch Galaxy Note. Then, surprising everyone but Samsung, the Note turned out to be a hit, selling 10 million units as of last summer. An Explosion of Phablets Samsung recently rolled out the Galaxy Note II, which is a hair larger than the Galaxy Note and looks to be an even bigger hit, selling 5 million units in just the first three months since launch.  Subsequently, dozens of phone makers have announced their own phablets, including the consumer electronics giants of mainland China, ZTE and Huawei; Taiwan's HTC and Lenovo; Sony; American manufacturer Vizio; South Korea's LG; and even one Shenzhen, China, manufacturer called Zopo that is making phablets its primary focus. Not to mention a stream of cheap knock-offs from vendors with no brand at all. So what’s going on here? When analysts declare that ""we expect 2013 to be the Year of the Phablet,"" have they lost their minds? Are phablets the netbooks of 2013, doomed to be produced in mass quantities but yielding a user experience so unsatisfying that the category eventually dies? Quite the opposite, I’d argue. In fact, I’m willing to bet that Phablets are going to be the PCs of this decade. They will become the default computing device of most of the developing world, and a surprising proportion of those who live in rich countries will eventually sign on, as well. The reasons are pretty simple. In Emerging Markets, Consumers Need One Device That Can Do Everything We thought that device would be the phone, but given the popularity of tablets, it turns out that bigger really is better. For example phablets are taking over in India.  ""Earlier I was using a smartphone and also had a tablet but later realised that a phablet was better as you can make calls and use it as a tablet as well,"" one student told the Times of India. That pretty much sums it up: If your budget is limited, why deal with two different upgrade cycles and two different devices, when you can put all of your money into a single device? And now that device, which is probably your primary computer, has wireless data connectivity wherever you go. Low-end phablets are going for as little as 6,000 rupees ($110) in India. Consumers in Rich Countries Don’t Need Phones Anymore — They Demand Bigger Screens U.S. journalists love to hold phablets up to their heads in order to prove how ridiculous they are as phones, but that misses the point: The fraction of time we spend using these devices for phone conversations continues to shrink.  In surveys, time spent on calls comes in fourth after web browsing, social media, music and gaming, and on average may represent as little as 10% of the two hours a day we spend on our ""phones."" The latest phablets exemplify this trend. Sharp has created a ridiculously high-resolution touchscreen with a 5-inch diagonal that has the same resolution as high-end HD televisions with 64 times as much surface area.  For reference, these have a resolution of 440 pixels per inch, compared to the much-ballyhooed “retina” display in the iPhone 5, which has 326 pixels per inch. That’s a resolution so high that the average user probably can’t even tell the difference. And yet these screens have made it into so many of the latest high-end phablets that Sharp can barely keep up with demand. High-end phablets are starting to include processors and storage capacity that put them on par with low-end laptops. They can be full media centers capable of driving giant televisions and high-end sound systems. There is also some indication that screen size has become aspirational, as users seek to differentiate their devices from the endless litany of regular smartphones. Having a Single Connected Device Is a Good Way to Reduce the Cost of Bandwidth Users do not require any more convincing that tablets are great. In 2013, they’re going to buy more of them than laptop computers. The problem is that the carrier-centric nature of much wireless connectivity in rich countries locks users into high monthly fees for the privilege of accessing the cell network.  That’s probably one reason why phablets are taking off in Asia and other emerging markets, where pay-as-you-go plans and devices that accommodate multiple sim cards (to allow users to use more than one carrier) are more common. In either case, wireless bandwidth is still relatively expensive, so using a single device for most lightweight computing and connectivity makes sense. The Idea That a Phablet Is Less Portable Is a Red Herring Sure, many phablets are so large that they can’t fit in your pocket, but that’s a very male tech writer view of smartphones. Stashed in a purse or a bag, a phablet is no less portable than an e-reader or a small tablet, and users don’t seem to have a problem toting those just about everywhere. Clearly, for millions of people, a phablet that eliminates the need for owning and carrying two separate devices—a phone and a tablet—is a better solution. Apple Could Be Forced to Follow Suit At least one analyst, Topeka Capital Markets’s Brian White, insists that Apple could come out with an iPhone with a bigger screen by this summer. That would fit the pattern set by the iPad Mini, in which other manufacturers produced what looked like a viable product category—the 7-inch tablet—and Apple decided it was a market opportunity worth pursuing.  Unlike netbooks, a faddish category which Apple famously ignored, phablets tend to be high-end devices that fit with Apple’s pattern of making best in class hardware that allows the company to maintain its high margins. Apple’s strength has always been taking others’ good ideas and improving on them, anyway. It may sound absurd, but there’s one way Apple could instantly dominate the market by creating the biggest phablet ever: upgrade the cellular radio in the iPad Mini LTE so that it can make calls.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/arrested-development-may/,'Arrested Development' Returns in May,"Arrested Development fans, your wait is nearly over. The Bluths are set to return for their feverishly anticipated fourth season this May. The cult favorite went off the air after three seasons, in 2006, but Netflix signed on in 2011 to host new episodes of the show after seeing its immense popularity with subscribers. Executive producer Ron Howard has since tweeted a photo of the new season's script and star Jason Bateman later shared photos from the writers' room. Bateman also shared photos from the set in August.  But Wednesday's news, revealed at a panel at the 2013 Television Critics Association Winter Press Tour, marks the most detailed to date. Season four will consist of 14 episodes, up from 10 as originally planned, and the entire batch will reportedly be released at once. Arrested Development fans will also have to get used a slightly different narrative approach — each episode is said to focus primarily on just one character, with only Michael Bluth, played by Bateman, appearing in all 14.  Arrested Development is Netflix's biggest name exclusively hosted series, but just one of several the company is using to try to shake up the television industry. Five other shows are set to premiere on Netflix this year as well, including House of Cards, produced by David Fincher and starring Kevin Spacey, and Derek, which Ricky Gervais writes and stars in.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/beam-remote-telepresence/,Beam Remote Sends Your Head Anywhere in the World," LAS VEGAS — Cross-country and international travel is expensive. Three or four trips to London, Paris or Taiwan a year and you're spending at least $16,000. What if you could spend that much and be in Europe and at home as often as you want? That's what Suitable Technologies' Beam Remote Presence System promises. The roughly 5.5-foot-tall system is available now and on display at CES 2013. I got to take it for a drive and have to say, it's a pretty cool system. Here's how it works. Beam connects to your network via a Wi-Fi or cellular broadband connection. It has a large LCD screen atop two slim bars and a rolling base. There's also a charging station. Beam usually starts there so it's fully charged when you're ready to “travel.” If you're controlling Beam, your view is via your computer or laptop. You drive Beam with a joystick or, more commonly, the arrow keys on your keyboard, while Beam cruises along at up to 3 miles per hour. Your webcam beams your face to the Beam device, so your disembodied head looks like you're wherever your Beam is. It's like your own personal transporter, without the dangerous (and currently impossible) Star Trek hardware.  Controlling Beam is remarkably easy. I got a 30-second tutorial and was soon following someone around Beam's Palo Alto offices. The display helps guide you by showing directional overlays on top of the video feed that mimic the direction and driving directions you're sending to the remote presence device. Beam's two cameras show you what's ahead of you and what's at your “feet.” When you're done with your remote meeting or making the rounds at a hospital, you simply drive Beam back to its charging station, spin around and back into the charging base. I had a great time driving Beam around and meeting people at Suitable Technologies' offices. What would you do with a remote presence device? Let me know in the comments.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/bieber-4chan-hoax/,The Anatomy of a 4chan Hoax,"When the 4chan imageboard community helped make #cutforbieber a trending topic on Twitter and the subject of more than a half dozen news stories Monday, the world collectively gasped at the thought of Justin Bieber fans cutting themselves in response to a photo of the teenage heartthrob smoking marijuana. Yet underneath the shock and awe, 4chan's first prank of the year was about more than just cheap laughs. Since its inception nine years ago, 4chan has become known as the Internet's sketchy male outhouse — a place where people can make crude jokes, show one another their penises, share their porn collections and shock one another with gory photos, all under the guise of anonymity. The site retained its smutty charm in 2012, but its tradition of schemes and pranks at the expense of other websites and the mainstream media took on a new level of sophistication. In the past six months, 4chan users rigged TIME magazine's Person of the Year poll in favor of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and made ""Hitler Did Nothing Wrong"" look like the most popular name for a new Mountain Dew flavor. In recent years, 4chan has become best known as the site that spawned Anonymous, the hacktivist collective that spent 2012 cracking FBI databases, lending a helping hand to Syrians and seeking justice for a rape victim in Steubenville, Ohio.  But while Anonymous may have been spawned by 4chan, it no longer necessarily calls it home. Major Anonymous mouthpieces like the influential @YourAnonNews have shifted largely to Twitter or other sites. Anonymous has become a sociopolitical force. 4chan, meanwhile, has returned to its roots — with a twist. While most 4chan stunts have been for the lulz, the sinister hoax at the expense of impressionable Beleibers is an example of the community's renewed obsession with manipulating the media into reporting on anything. ""I don't think it's at the children as it is the dum-dum tabloid media,"" Anonymous expert Cole Stryker told the Daily Dot. ""I think Anonymous is going to revert back to this playfully dark mentality ... This stuff is way more fun than trying to bring down Tunisian government websites."" The latest scheme started as most have, on the site's random imageboard known as /b/, a place where users exchange foul language, violent images and sexual content freely. The mission was to make the #cutforbieber hashtag trend on Twitter worldwide with photos of bloodied arms in response to one of Bieber smoking marijuana, and ""see if we can get some little girls to cut themselves.""  Once the scheme got rolling, the users who started the original /b/ thread removed it from the site in an attempt to hide their tracks and trick media organizations into believing the Twitter hashtag appeared organically. It's around that point where the scheming likely moved to a private room on Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and leadership roles were determined, said _js5, an IRC user who created the Java script used to game TIME magazine's Person of the Year poll in favor of Kim Jong-Un and spell ""KJU GAS CHAMBERS"" with the first letter of each candidate's name. ""The main hub of people working on the initiative will set goals and are very strict on following them,"" _js5 explained to the Daily Dot. _js5 also claims to have seen chatter about the scheme on the Internet after the photo of Bieber first leaked on Jan. 4. ""The leadership will decide the next moves and leadership is determined by skill, and how much power that person holds. The more resources a person has, the more power they will have. Access to easy media, web servers, administration of chat channels are examples of this."" With the leadership established and the goal set, #cutforbieber went worldwide shortly after the 4chan thread was deleted. The result was gruesome. Photos of bloodied arms, a fake Facebook memorial page for a fan, and fake tweets from Bieber himself flooded Twitter, Buzzfeed reported. #cutforbieber became the most popular hashtag on Twitter some time around 2:30 p.m. EST Monday. ""As much as I love laughing at mindless internet drones joining an initiative that trolls set forward this one is a little too dark for my taste,"" _js5 added. Almost immediately after #cutforbieber was a success, 4chan tried to double down on its trolling by making #smoke4bieber a trending topic. ""Time to counter troll!!!!"" an anonymous user wrote around 6 p.m. EST Monday. ""We will now fuck with more kids by influencing them to smoke. It will still piss people off, and will make some stupid 12yr old smoke. At the end of the day, Bieber takes all the blame.""  The effort proved to be futile due in part to a breakdown in leadership, said Jacob, a 4chan user. ""Once it reaches media attention, it gets picked up by outsiders of the community, and that's when it loses its leadership structure,"" Jacob added. _js5 has been no stranger to the effects of such leadership woes and its damaging effects. After TIME magazine launched its prestigious Person of the Year poll on Nov. 26. users from Reddit, 4chan, and Internet Relay Chat (IRC) gamed the online poll using a Java script by _js5 to automate votes for the Korean leader.  The same script also enabled the group to to spell ""KJU GAS CHAMBERS"" with the first letter of each candidate's name and ultimately help Kim win Person of the Year Reader Poll, despite North Korea's government run news organization reporting the opposite. (TIME's coveted cover ultimately went to President Barack Obama.) With the deed done, the leadership structure behind the Time prank fell apart. Other IRC users retaliated against _js5 for cooperating with the Daily Dot and for claiming ownership of the Java script by ordering pizzas to his home and dumping his personal information online. So in the end, was #cut4bieber a success? Articles by Fox News, Daily Mail, Wired, The Telegraph and Buzzfeed all point to yes. ""I look at these pranks as a cultural antidote to the asinine celebrity industrial complex,"" Stryker said. ""It's a way for people to take the piss out of powerful media entities that try to present themselves as authentic to their audiences."" And if #cut4bieber is any indication, 2013 is shaping up to be the year of the prank. ""Expect TIME magazine to get rigged again, and more people on Twitter to get trolled,"" _js5 said. ""I predict the hoaxes to be more frequent. They gained a national spotlight recently in 2012 and people have gained a taste of what to expect."" Photo courtesy of Flickr, THERKD

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/blue-umbrella-teaser-video-pixar/,Watch Pixar's 'Blue Umbrella' Teaser," Pixar released a rain-soaked teaser video for The Blue Umbrella, an animated short that will be shown to theater-goers who attend Monsters University starting June 21. In it, we see an animated blue umbrella eyeing a red one among a sea of black umbrellas. Despite the dreary weather, Pixar says the two colorful umbrella begin a relationship.

 ""It is just another evening commute until the rain starts to fall, and the city comes alive to the sound of dripping rain pipes, whistling awnings and gurgling gutters,"" Pixar says. ""And in the midst, two umbrellas — one blue, one not — fall eternally in love."" Pixar fans are particularly excited about Brave as it is the first of their films to feature a female lead. Brave is now in theaters.
 This is just the first of two trailers on the list that promoted Pixar's surprise hit Cars 2. Of the four teasers released for Monsters University this week, Disney's got the most buzz. Do you think Mike's punchline is funniest in this spot? Australian DJ Pogo remixed UP to create this loungy track. If you close your eyes, you could almost forget that most of the lyrics are sung by a pint-sized animated boy scout. While some Pixar shorts fly under the radar (pardon the pun), this one snagged an Academy Award in 2001, when it aired alongside Monsters, Inc.. This short hit theaters with Ratatouille in 2006. Finally, someone acknowledges that the monsters are naked. It's no wonder this film has yet to be rated. Pixar released this video as one of their favorite 30-second clips from their films. Witness as a poor Ken learns that he is nothing but Barbie's arm candy; belligerence ensues.  Here's another trailer for the Cars sequel flick. Thumbnail image courtesy of YouTube "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/chesapeake-light-tower-energy/,Aging Ocean Tower May Be Used as Energy Lab,"A rusty 48-year-old tower standing in the Atlantic Ocean may soon get a makeover for modern energy. The one-time lighthouse even may accommodate energy researchers and staff for overnight stays. Officials at the U.S. Department of Energy want to retrofit the Chesapeake Light Tower — located 13 miles off Virginia Beach, Va. — for basic research into harvesting electricity from gigantic offshore wind turbines. The tower would be equipped with instruments for measuring the wind 100 meters (328 feet) above the surface of the sea, which is the typical height of ocean turbines. Good measurements will encourage funding for offshore wind power, said Will Shaw, a researcher at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory who would lead the science team at the tower. Nobody has direct measurements of ocean-turbine-height wind right now, but that data would be important to potential investors seeking assurances that offshore wind is strong and will make lots of electricity. The Department of Energy has given the National Renewable Energy Laboratory $3 million to assess the Chesapeake Light Tower and come up with a remodeling plan, said Jim Green of NREL, who would lead the remodeling. Green expects the $3 million will be more than enough for assessment, so some of it can go toward building, too. It is too early to say how much additional funding construction will need, he said. It is still possible the assessment will find it too expensive to turn the Chesapeake Light Tower into a working, mid-ocean research lab, Green told TechNewsDaily. Officials hope to have the lab ready to go by 2014 or 2015, however. Previously, the Coast Guard owned and maintained the aging offshore tower, Virginia Beach TV station WVEC reported. It cost $50,000 for an inspection every other year, plus more for repairs. If the plans go through, the new tools the Chesapeake Light Tower will get include a 328-foot-tall add-on for measuring conditions at that altitude. The 1960s-era structure also will get LIDAR, or light detection and ranging equipment, which will measure wind speeds by sending out laser beams and calculating how long it takes those beams to return to the equipment after they bounce off of dust particles and droplets of sea spray. Researchers are especially interested in testing the accuracy of buoy-borne LIDAR. The Chesapeake Light Tower already has a helicopter landing pad and is able to accommodate people overnight.  ""It's a unique facility. There's nothing like it in U.S. waters,"" Shaw said. In the further future, Shaw said the tower could make measurements for how much electricity might be harvested from the up-and-down motion of waves, a potential source of non-polluting electricity that has been less well studied than offshore wind. Shaw and two colleagues presented their plans on Jan. 8 at the annual meeting of the American Meteorological Society in Austin, Texas. Photo courtesy of Flickr, Nugget04

""I've been backstage looking at all the new devices, and I was reminded that when I was president, the average cellphone weighed 5 pounds,"" Clinton said. ""The day I took the oath of office, a grand total of 50 sites were on the Internet. More have been added since I started talking."" But he noted South Korea is now number one in the world for computer download speeds, and the U.S. has fallen to number 15. ""Our speeds are one-fourth of theirs, and we have fallen off the map,"" Clinton said. ""Think about all the basic things we are taking for granted. If the screen went dark or the microphone failed ... if you get bored from my speech, you can get water — but I have spent time in part of the world where you can't do that. Mobile technology is doing so much now to lift the poor."" He said he is impressed by how much technology is affecting our lives, and how it can be used for the future. Although he said he no longer drives, someone recently told him to sit in his Ford car, and told its built-in infotainment system to provide directions to the nearest Chinese restaurant. ""I got a map about how to drive there, which I didn't know before,"" he said. ""I keep thinking about this in terms of the future. If you look at what the Arab Spring did to use social networks ... and how social media has been used among my wife's leadership ... there is a lot we can do to overcome challenges.""

The iChats have been popular and I'm not the only one who has used that incentive.  Paul Rudd's done a bunch of [iChats] ... I think he's usually naked for his.  I can't promise that, but mine have been great. It's actually been kind of mind-blowing how high-quality the conversations I've had with people have been. We've actually gotten great ideas for how to make CrowdRise better. Two of the people who won chats with us we wanted to hire.   What are your thoughts on Will Ferrell's cowbell? Will's cowbell is by now legend. I wouldn't waste too much time on anyone who was like, ""What's that? I don't get it."" It's hard to think of a scenario in life not improved by its pleasing gong. And Jimmy Kimmel's punches? Which friend of yours would you let Jimmy punch? Kimmel is no Manny Pacquiao, but he's not Butterball either. I wouldn't be afraid personally but I wouldn't let him hit my sister.  Do you have any fun stories to share with us about CrowdRise's adventures last year? CrowdRise's growth is fairly astonishing. Just over two years ago it was four of us in a living room and so when I'm walking through the airport and see people wearing our T-shirts, let alone surf the site and see the numbers people are raising and the creativity they're bringing to the game, it's pretty amazing.  David Axelrod said he'd shave his famed mustache if he raised over $1 million for epilepsy research, and he did it. President Obama donated, which was a highlight.  We're thinking maybe we popped [Obama]'s crowdfunding cherry ... which is nice. We were very inspired by all these projects: We're in the middle of our second year of the Mozilla Firefox Challenge, which has been amazing again. We love Mozilla because they're built on the same ethos that CrowdRise is ... that many people coming together can do great things to create a better society. They've put up $200,000 in prize money to drive grassroots fundraising for hundreds of charities and they're going to leverage their money many times over. Most people don't even realize that Mozilla is a non-profit foundation and that Firefox is a community-created browser created by over 40,000 volunteers who believe in free and open access to the Internet. We're big fans of what they do and the way they do it, and we love that they're helping us promote the power of the crowd. How would you explain the platform to a friend who has never heard of it? CrowdRise kicks ass because it gives a huge boost to people who believe that a little bit of effort by lots of people actually will change the world for the better.  And those are my favorite people.  Those are the people I like to hang out with and who inspire me. To people who have never heard of it I say CrowdRise is the best platform on the planet from which to support the charities and causes that you care about.   It's been successful because CrowdRise is doing much more than providing rudimentary engineering of collecting donations ... we're delivering a new game theory about how to leverage resources.  And people have more fun hanging out with us.
 
What's next for CrowdRise and for yourself in 2013?
 
The plan is to continue to provide the most creative, fun and cost-efficient platform to raise money for charity and to keep trying to come up with new ways to engage people in the experience of contributing to collective social action.  Crowdfunding is exploding and we're excited to be right in the middle of it.  I'm going to Germany to make another movie with Wes Anderson next week, which is about as much fun as you can have with your clothes on.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/dad-son-video-games/,Dad Hires Hit Men to Kill Son — in Video Games," A father in China perturbed by the amount of time his adult son spent playing online video games didn't ground the young man. He didn't take away his electronics. And he didn't try to reason with him.  Instead, he took what may be a much more logical approach: Hiring digital hit men in the form of other gamers to kill off all his son's characters, according to the BBC. The son reportedly uncovered the truth after getting tired of other players targeting him then asking one why he was being singled out. The father said he was just trying to discourage his son from playing so much, he told local media, and the two have reportedly solved their differences since.  It's a different form of parenting, to be sure, but just the latest examples of parents who have sought to counteract technology's increasingly all-consuming spell over sons and daughters worldwide. This Christmas, a mother gained attention online after giving her 13-year-old son an iPhone for Christmas — but requiring him to sign a contract agreeing to how he would and wouldn't use the device first. In February, a father uploaded video of himself shooting his daughter's laptop several times and the clip went wildly viral online.  Thumbnail image courtesy Flickr, Robert Anthony Provost "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/dallas-sports-teams-social-media-catfight/,How One Dallas Sports Team Epically Burned Another on Twitter,"A pair of Dallas sports teams got into a pretty bizarre, petty spat on social media this week — a bit embarrassing for them but funny for the rest of us. And you'd better call up the burn ward, because ""America's Team"" just got put in check.  The tiff started when when the NFL Cowboys posted a since-deleted tweet to its 500,000 followers referencing pro hockey's extended lockout and reading: ""Similarly in the category of nobody-cares…the NHL is back!"" The Stars, Big D's NHL franchise, were non-plussed with the Cowboys' unprovoked dis and fired back with their own Twitter post on Tuesday morning: At least our #9 got the job done..... RT:"" @dallascowboys Similarly in the category of nobody-cares…the NHL is back!"" twitter.com/DallasStars/st… — Dallas Stars (@DallasStars) January 8, 2013 The post references Mike Modano, who wore the number 9 jersey for the Stars and led the team to the 1999 Stanley Cup title. It contrasts that achievement with Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, who also wears number 9 but is well-known for bungling big games.   The Stars' rebuttal became a hit with many fans on Twitter with more than 14,000 retweets, and showed once again that standing up for oneself is often the best way to deal with a bully. The Cowboys soon backtracked, calling the post an accident, and apologized for the #shotsfired tweet: Apology accepted“@dallascowboys: @dallasstars our sincere apologies for the inappropriate tweet posted accidentally. Good luck this season.” — Dallas Stars (@DallasStars) January 8, 2013 Apology accepted, perhaps, but the Tony Romo dis is still live on the Stars' timeline. Well played, Dallas Stars, well played.  Do you think the Stars overreacted, or was it entertaining and appropriate? Give us your take in the comments.  Image credit Getty Images/Getty Images Sport/Ronald Martinez "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/dance-fitness-game-for-classrooms/,DanceDance Revolution Comes to the Classroom,"It won't be long before students are playing video games at school.  A new interactive fitness game announced at International CES 2013 brings at-home fitness video games to school. DanceDance Revolution Classroom Edition was made with school physical education class in mind.  With the DanceDance Revolution games, users follow steps to dance choreography while listening to hit songs. Players hold a control that senses their movements or move on a mat, depending on the game console used. Players get points based on how close their moves matched-up to the ones on the screen. The fun calorie-burning game is played by both adults and children. This particular edition was made to bring that same idea to schools.  This latest classroom version lets as many as 48 students play at one time. Each student must have a wireless mat that features a smart card reader to tracks each student's individual progress. The idea is that while students move to the beat, teachers can see their progress including steps, body mass index (BMI) and caloric burn rate.  So far, the game has been launched at three schools located in Longwood, Fla., Gainesville, Ga., and Fresno, Texas, with assistance from KONAMI Digital Entertainment, Inc., which makes the game, and UnitedHealthcare, who it partnered with for this school edition.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/digital-advertising-100-billion/,Report: Digital Advertising Broke $100 Billion in 2012,"Global digital advertising spending broke $100 billion for the first time, according to eMarketer, which predicts the business will grow another 15.1% this year. That figure compares to a market increase of 17.8% in 2012. The slowing growth rate appears to be a natural consequence of the maturation of the industry — the larger it gets, the harder it is to grow. While figures for the entire ad industry's growth in 2012 aren't in yet, Magna Global last June predicted that the ad business would expand 4.8% worldwide in 2012. Digital advertising's stronger growth means it's taking up more of the overall business. eMarketer estimates that online advertising accounted for just under 20% of all advertising. This year, 21.7% of the advertising pie will be taken up by digital advertising. The double-digit growth is expected to decline steadily until 2016.  Not surprisingly, eMarketer found that the biggest growth is happening outside of so-called mature markets. In particular, digital ad spending grew 55.8% in the Middle East and Africa in 2012 and 38.4% in Eastern Europe compared to 21.5% and 13.9% for North America and Western Europe, respectively. While eMarketer doesn't break down ad spending by region, IAB last year estimated that the digital ad spend in the U.S. hit $31 billion in 2011.  Image courtesy of iStockphoto, Pashalgnatov "

It features the dolphin pod swimming near a boat of whale-watchers who ooh and ahh at the breathtaking sight.  ""The line of dolphins could be seen miles away churning up the water,"" Dolphin Safari wrote on the video's YouTube page. ""The dolphins turned and stampeded directly over to the boat. Often this unusual behavior happens without warning or anything frightening them as was the case this time.""

Luckily, this video let's you in on the illusion to truly experience the hilarity of a well-crafted prank. Magician and YouTube prankster Magic of Rahat stumped drive thru workers by pulling up to the window in a suit that camouflages him with the car seat. Watch as employees go through a variety of emotions, ranging from spooked to questioning their mental health. SEE ALSO: How to Mystify Drive-Thru Employees  We highly recommend viewers not attempt the prank on the roads. 
  
BONUS: 10 Safer Pranks for the Office Create an official looking notice (as per the house style of your workplace) informing staff that an item of office equipment is now equipped with speech recognition technology. Add a few suggested commands. Stick the notice to the equipment. Sit back and watch your colleagues shout at an inanimate object. Secretly video the action for prolonged fun. Simple, yet effective. Just switch the telephone plugs of your colleagues' phone lines (leaving their phones in exactly the same place) and enjoy the confusion as they repeatedly receive calls for each other. Works best with coworkers that aren't on the best terms to start with. This one requires a little planning and collaboration, but the effect will be worth the effort. Arrange with coworkers to each bring in several changes of clothes. Then, throughout the morning repeatedly switch items of clothing. Ensure your mark sees you all in as many different items as you can manage. Wait for the other shoe to drop. Anyone leaving their mouse unattended around April 1 deserves punishment. While the classic trick was to remove the mouse's tracker ball, nowadays you can achieve the same effect by putting some tape over the mouse's laser tracker. Alternatively, and if you can find time with an unattended computer, change the mouse's settings for maximum confusion. This is another oldie-but-goldie for anyone in an office where a photocopier is still regularly used. Place a paper clip over or on a piece of blank paper and make several copies. Now, place them back on the top of the paper tray. Hang around to see your colleague's confusion as they desperately try and find the strange paper clip that's showing up on all their copies.  For this you'll need a pair of shoes, a pair of trousers, some newspaper (or something similar) for stuffing and possibly a step ladder. In a toilet stall with a gap at the bottom, set up your items of clothing to look as if someone is using the conveniences. Lock the stall (from the outside if possible, otherwise this is where the step ladder comes in) and leave your mystery ""person"" to confuse (and very possibly worry) restroom users for the rest of the day. This is perhaps more effective with older colleagues who are likely to have experienced the pain of the ""Blue Screen of Death."" For this prank, it's just a matter of finding an appropriate screen grab and either leaving it on your co-worker's display, or setting it as the screen saver for a nasty surprise.  Find, or make a recording of a repetitive noise (a heart beat works well for maximum distress) or dig out a portable radio. Set the volume to just audible and hide it in a filing cabinet, cupboard, drawer, etc., near to your mark. Now wait for your colleague to ask if anyone else can hear that heart beat/static/music and prepare to deny all. Several times. A straight face is essential. Does your office issue a paper list of phone extensions? If so, there's fun to be had. You need to access the master doc (or re-create it if need be). Swap the extensions and then replace your target's list with the doctored version. Obviously you'll need to replicate any creases, edits, coffee stains and so on, but if you can pull this off, you're in for a treat as your unsuspecting mark blithely dials a work buddy and instead gets the MD. Our last prank is especially effective if your colleagues are expecting you to pull some kind of stunt. This April Fools', just do nothing. Sit and smirk at everything on the morning of the 1st. They will rack their brains desperately trying to work out what you've plotted. You can help out their anxiety levels with loaded comments to match your smirk. ""Enjoy your coffee."" ""Have you used the water cooler yet today?"" ""Aren't you going to answer that?"" Image courtesy of Magic of Rahat "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/electronics-can-cost-energy/,That Flat Screen TV May Cost More Than You Think,"LAS VEGAS – Running your electronics can get pricey. You already know about Vampire energy and how simply having your TV or DVR plugged in can cost you money. But do you have any idea how much it actually costs to run those devices? A new gadget being shown at the International CES – MeterPlug —  will not only tell you how much your new flat screen TV costs to run, it will send the data to your smartphone via Bluetooth. It’s a small plug that sits between the device’s plug and the outlet or power strip. Once paired with your phone, it will tell you your current wattage and costs.  MeterPlug does this by finding the electric rates in your area based on the GPS in your phone. The accompanying free app, which runs on both iOS and Android, lets you turn a device on or off from your phone — welcome news for true couch potatoes.   Why do you need to know all this? When you can see which devices are running up your electric bill, you can make informed decisions about whether or not to leave them plugged in. A gaming system, for instance, that’s only used by the kids on the weekend, might be unplugged or turned off on the power strip in order to save on electricity. Or you may learn it’s cheaper to run your dishwasher or laundry in the evening as opposed to during the day. The MeterPlug also helps you save energy. It acts as a proximity sensor so if you leave the room for a period of time, it will turn the device off. Come back in and the device turns on. You can plug only one device into each MeterPlug but they’re not terribly expensive. They cost around $60 each which you’ll hopefully make up in savings. They can be pre-ordered on Indiegogo now and are expected to ship in April.  Photo courtesy of iStockphoto, zentilia  Powerful yet fun DIY robotics for adults and children.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/eton-wether-radios/,These Radios Could Save Your Life," LAS VEGAS — Scientists warn that Hurricane Sandy-sized storms are likely to become biannual and not once-in-a-lifetime events. In other words, it's time to get serious about dangerous weather and finding ways to track and react in real time. In this case, knowledge is power and safety. Eaton, a company that's been making weather-ready gear for a long time (I have one of its hand-cranked radios at home), unveiled this week at CES 2013 a new set of weather emergency clock radios that could help you get out of the way of the next super storm before it's right on top of you. The new ZoneGuard and ZoneGuard Plus are battery- and AC-powered weather radios that offer Weather Band, AM and FM frequencies. Most notably, they have an LED-based light on top that tells you if the weather situation is, for instance, safe (green) or red (dangerous) for up to 25 weather locations, based on county codes. They're small enough to sit on an end table, and they perform all the functions of standard clock radios. The $99 version comes with two tiny, wireless remote modules that you can place in other rooms — additional remotes cost extra. These modules communicate with the base radio and will also alert you to dangerous weather emergencies.  Both ZoneGuard radios will ship sometime in Q1.
 
Would you buy one of these radios for your area or do you trust your own weather instincts? Check out the video above and then let us know in the comments. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/facebook-stock-30/,Facebook Stock Hits $30 For First Time Since July,"Facebook may finally be over its 20-something phase. The company's stock hit $30 a share on Wednesday for the first time since mid-July, after several consecutive days of hovering around the $29 mark. The stock opened at $29.63 a share and climbed above $30 in early trading, a gain of more than 3% on the day. Facebook originally fell below $30 in late May, less than two weeks after the company IPO-ed at $38 a share, and briefly climbed back above it in late June before giving it up again. The stock eventually dipped to as low as $17.55 a share in early September, before rebounding on a pledge by CEO Mark Zuckerberg not to sell stock. It has gradually ticked up since then on the strength of the company's September quarter earnings report and the expiration of its stock lockup periods for employees. The stock's surge this month has been fueled by analyst optimism for Facebook's revenue options and its strength on mobile as well as the overall momentum of the stock market following a deal by the U.S. Congress to avert the so-called fiscal cliff. The company also sent out invites Tuesday to a press event later this month to ""come and see what we're building,"" fueling speculation about what will be announced. Several analysts have put out positive forecasts for the company in recent weeks. JP Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth raised his price target on the stock last week to $35 from $29, noting that ""marketer feedback on mobile and news feed ads has been very positive."" Likewise, William Blair Analyst Ralph Schackart praised the potential of the Facebook ad exchange. In the span of seven months, the discussion has shifted from whether Facebook can monetize its mobile users to counting the number of ways that it can. ""Are the worst days behind it in that investors are aware it's a real business? Absolutely,"" Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research Group, told Mashable. Even so, the stock's roller coaster ride will likely continue as analysts and investors look to the company's upcoming earnings reports to decipher the progress and viability of Facebook's revenue-generation strategies. ""Investors are still going to be skeptical of Facebook and earnings are going to be important going forward,"" Kevin Pleines, an analyst with Birinyi Associates, said in an e-mail. ""I think there is still a lot of uncertainly how well and consistently they can monetize their users and grow revenue."" While the $30 mark is a notable threshold, the real milestone continues to be the IPO price. If and when Facebook's stock returns to $38 a share, Pleines says the worst will really be over.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/family-social-networks/,Social Sites for Families: More Personal than Facebook,"We've all seen (and some of us have been) that person on Facebook — the over-sharer. Some of us may be happy to divulge every intimate detail of our personal lives; others are more private.  Social networks for families (FamilyLeaf, MyFamily.com, Rootsy, Origami), neighbors (Nextdoor), and select groups of family and friends (Path), have bloomed in the past few years. A growing number of us, it seems, want a more intimate online sharing experience.  On FamilyLeaf, as with other social sites meant for small groups, users can share photos and messages with their connections on a secure network.  ""Many of our most active users are turned off by Facebook's openness — and they use FamilyLeaf because it's meant only for family,"" Co-founder Ajay Mehta says.  Connecting to family on Facebook results in limited sharing between family members, however. The presence of younger members limit what their relatives can see. ""There's a disconnect,"" says Mehta. ""Older members of the family create Facebook accounts just for family members, but they can't understand the complexities, while younger people tend to restrict their family members' access to their Facebook, even if they accept them as 'friends' in the first place.  ""The kind of content users share on both services is simply different, and users love FamilyLeaf because we all have memories, photo albums, and conversations that are meant to stay within the family.""  The cofounder of FamilyLeaf, Wesley Zhao, says sites like this are important to his family relationship since Facebook is blocked in his native China. With FamilyLeaf, for the first time in years, his family in China were able to see updates and photos from his American branch of his family.   SEE ALSO: 5 Ways to Avoid Oversharing on Social Media  Other users tell Mashable they use the site for keeping in touch with ill loved ones, or sharing photos of children with extended family members, or sharing photos of special occasions with only a select group.  One FamilyLeaf user from Brazil said they used the site to share their six-year struggle of trying to get pregnant — and, ultimately, the news when they got pregnant. ""We like that the site is private, and we can share what we want to without the fear of others seeing and judging.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/football-helmet-sensors/,The Football Helmet That Could Save Your Kid's Brain,"Violent collisions in the NFL are getting more attention from players, journalists and medical professionals — and for good reason. We're just beginning to grasp the effects that repeated big hits can have on the brain, and a troubling series of violent deaths of current and former pros has only raised the stakes for trying to understand how to manage the damage players do to themselves and one another.  But what about tackle football at the youth level? Surely, slamming into one another over and over can't be good for growing bodies either, right?  Well, longtime helmet-maker Riddell may have just come up with an innovative solution to track and minimize the damage to young players' brains, according to ESPN.com.  SEE ALSO: Tiny Girl's Stunning Tackle Football Highlights Will Drop Your Jaw [VIDEO]
 It's called the InSite Impact Response System, and it uses ""sensors, data processing units and display monitors"" — in the words of Riddell's official trademark filing — to track blows to the head and their impact on young athletes. In other words: fine-tuned tech and big data to provide definitive answers about when a player should be taken out or allowed to continue playing.  Sensors will be located in the helmet's cushiony interior liner, ESPN reports, and issue wireless alerts to coaches or training staff when a player sustains a hit that exceeds acceptable force measurements. Software will allow young gridiron stars — or, more likely, their coaches and parents — to track accumulated head shots over time, as well.  The technology is expected to be made available for purchase on Riddell's website this spring.  Do you think this can help make tackle football safer for young kids — or should they even be allowed to play at all? Give us your take in the comments.  Image courtesy Flickr, DC DPR "

Google is expanding its free operating system to rice cookers, refrigerators and other home appliances. Adding the OS to more devices would be useful in helping Google and other manufacturers collect data, and also allow appliances to exchange information.  In the case of rice cookers, the device would be able to determine the type of rice and set cooking instructions. Other intelligent systems could signal an alert from a washing machine to your TV, letting you know when it's done. Check out the video above for more.  The International Data Corporation predicts the market for Internet-connected devices will reach $2 trillion in 2015, and Google is responding to the demand. Android-operating products made an appearance at CES in Las Vegas this week, including LG's Smart ThinQ Refrigerator, which can wirelessly connect and preheat LG's SmartOven.  Appliance makers operating on Android, like Samsung and Panasonic, have the ability to add their own features to the product. Panasonic already provides cloud-based services in Japan for its microwave oven and rice cooker, so users can search for recipes and program instructions using their smartphones.

The Doodle uses the famous map to spell the letters of its name. According to The Independent, the lines and names of the stops are accurate.  The Metropolitan Railway, as its known, opened on this day in 1863. The first journey took place between Paddington and Farringdon. At the time there were seven stations. Since then, 263 more stations have been added. Some 1.17 billion passenger rides took place across the system last year. The New York subway system delivered 1.64 billion rides in 2011 The oldest subway line in the U.S. started in 1897 in Boston. The New York subway system opened in 1904.

If not, you might want to consider rushing to your local pharmacy as soon as possible after you see this disturbing chart from Google.org. The non-profit arm of the search giant's empire has run an experiment every year since 2006 that has been remarkably accurate in predicting cases of flu in the U.S. It tracks sudden spikes in flu-based searches (people looking for flu remedies, for example) and places them on a map.  The results impressed the Centers for Disease Control, now a Google partner, since they tracked CDC data so precisely — before the CDC data had even been collated or released. Last year, one study called it an effective early warning system for emergency rooms. Here's the history:  Which is why we should be very concerned about this year's figures. According to Google, we're in the middle of the biggest flu season by far since its records began.  Check out the spike in flu-based searches nationwide in the chart below. It began in December, and isn't quitting yet.   For the first time this year, Google is breaking down results by city. So we can see, for example, that the flu appears to be far more serious in New York City than in San Francisco. (Check out the full Google flu trends site here.) And if you're looking for the most flu-free spots in the U.S.? The Google map suggests you visit Connecticut, the only state in the union with ""moderate"" flu activity.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/google-patent-claims-microsoft/,Google's Motorola Mobility Withdraws Patent Claims Against Microsoft,"Google-owned Motorola Mobility filed a motion Tuesday with the U.S. International Trade Commission to withdraw two patents that were part of a patent-violation claim against Microsoft.  The search giant owns the two standards-essential patents, called ""the H.264 patents,"" since acquiring Motorola last May. Dropping the claims means that Google is no longer stopping Microsoft from using video-compression technology on Xbox, according to All Things D. Microsoft wants to license the H.264 patents, but refuses to comply with Google's proposed demands for compensation, which the software giant has said is not ""anything remotely close to a reasonable price."" In a February blog post, Microsoft accused Motorola of breaching commitments that it and other companies had previously made to support industry standards, namely, ""if they had any patents essential to the standards, they would make their patents available on fair and reasonable terms, and would not use them to block competitors from shipping their products."" Despite withdrawing two patents, Google is still contesting one that is not part of an industry standard, All Things D reported.  SEE ALSO: Google XPhone: Long on Mystery, Short on Details

But what if they were unnecessary? What if your gadgets could survive a dunk in the swimming pool without any kind of external protection? That's the promise of HzO, a nano-coating that protects small electronics on the inside. The company says its WaterBlock technology defends against moisture at the molecular level, attaching to the circuits in device to repel any liquids. It doesn't add any weight and it doesn't affect performance, HzO claims. The coating isn't a consumer product — HzO is something device makers would need to incorporate into their manufacturing processes. And they have. HzO, which also put its WaterBlock tech on display at last year's show, will soon appear in gadgets from NavELite, which makes backlit compasses, and Atelier, who will be putting it in a luxury TAG Heuer smartphone. That's all well and good, but we'd like to see the coating — which protects against dives into even nasty beverages like beer and Powerade — come to Apple and Samsung devices. Like, now, please.

Identical in design to last year’s model, the watch is now running “Android 2” the company’s own custom version of the operating system specifically for the watch. Connected to your phone via Bluetooth, the watch can be used to answer calls, receive text messages, and even interact with Facebook and Twitter.

It's sitting on your butt, twitching your fingers over a dozen multi-colored buttons. You rarely break a sweat. I can tell you though, from personal experience, that if you ever get to try Intellect Motion, you will sweat and bounce around like never before. Intellect Motion's prototype system, on display here at CES 2013, consists of a steel frame, bungee cords, a computer, some web cams and wearable sensors to put your game-playing butt to work. To test it, I had the Intellect Motion team strap me in (very tightly, I might add), and connect all the bungee cords to me (via the harness). Those cords keep you propped up, but also provide tension that you have to work against. Once they powered up the game (any open-sourced one running on a PC should work), I had to move my body to run forward and twist to turn from side to side. This is more strenuous than it sounds. That's why they call it ""Play for Health."" At $10,000, the system is not cheap. However, Intellect Motion execs told me the product — which is still in the design and funding phase — is intended for pro gaming centers and child care. Check out the video to watch the system — and me — in action. "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/iphone-is-6-years-old/,"How Apple Sold the iPhone, 6 Years Ago Today","It's a widescreen iPod! No, wait, it's a breakthrough Internet communications device with desktop-class email! Best of all, it comes with Cingular phone service and Google’s groundbreaking maps! It was six years ago Wednesday that Steve Jobs strode on stage at the Moscone Center in San Francisco to deliver the Macworld keynote that introduced us to Apple's latest product: something called the iPhone. It's almost impossible to comprehend how much has changed in just six years. Jobs, alas, is no longer with us; his job has gone to the man whose visual voicemail was played at the keynote, Tim Cook. Apple no longer participates at Macworld. Oh, and the product Jobs introduced that day went on to lead a touchscreen smartphone revolution that has swept the entire planet.  Apple stock was at $87 that day, as Jobs proudly displayed on the iPhone's native Stocks app during the keynote. It surged to $92 by the end of the day. Six years later, it closed at $517 — and that's more than $100 below its high water mark.  One of the oddest features of the keynote, from today's perspective, was the presence of Eric Schmidt, then CEO of Google and member of the Apple board. Schmidt ran to the stage to congratulate Jobs and joked that they should merge the companies into ""AppleGoo."" (His company had bought a startup called Android two years' previously, but the first Android smartphone was still just a twinkle in Schmidt's eye.) ""You can't think of the Internet without thinking of Google,"" Jobs gushed, as he enthused about the search function in the Safari app and the Maps app the companies had developed together. Four years later, Jobs would be threatening to wage ""thermonuclear war"" against Android and accusing Schmidt of stealing the idea. Five years later, the companies would be at loggerheads over Maps.  Looking at the keynote again now, and reading the press release Apple issued that day, you can see the company struggling to define the device in terms the public would understand. A hundred million clickwheel iPods — what we now think of as the ""classic"" iPod — had been sold at that point, so the first definition Jobs reached for was ""widescreen iPod."" Watch the full keynote, below, and you'll notice the audience oohing and aahing at things we take for granted today, such as scrolling through your music on the touchscreen.  I happened to be in that audience, and can remember being wowed by the presentation. But I can also remember all the reasons I was skeptical. iPhone (it took the device some time to add a ""the"" before its name) had a maximum 8GB of memory at a time when the largest iPod was a tremendous 160GB.  All sorts of things were unproven until we could get our hands on one. The screen seemed like it would scratch really easily. Nobody knew how well the error correction would work (or, as it turned out, not work) on the touchscreen keyboard. It cost $599. Cingular, which had just been snapped up by AT&T, wasn't exactly the best cellphone provider in the known universe.  Would it really get as much as five hours of talk time? Would it really ship in June? Would the carrier really refrain from putting all sorts of layers of crap on top of the software, as they did on every single other phone out there? Still, I, and every tech journalist I knew, were hoping it wasn't too good to be true. The smartphones we had then — yes, we called our Palms and BlackBerrys smartphones — were starting to lose their luster. The time was ripe for something new, especially something with a pinch-and-zoom Internet browser. And all that space for extra apps on the homescreen meant something. Maybe Apple would even let developers submit their own apps. So happy sixth birthday, iPhone, you little prodigy. How far you've come in such a short space of time. And how little we can imagine where you'll be in another six years. But we're really looking forward to your 2019 keynote.  Images courtesy of YouTube "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/iran-cyberattacks-banks/,Is Iran Behind a Wave of Cyberattacks Against U.S. Banks?,"Several American banks, among them Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and others, have been the target of cyberattacks in recent months. While no bank records or personally identifiable information have been stolen from any bank, customers have been complaining of slow or unusable online banking services. The attacks are coming in the form of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks launched by networked computers in data centers. That's a level above less sophisticated DDoS attacks, which are commonly orchestrated like this: First, hackers gain control of a commandable network of ""bot"" computers by spreading a virus that infects thousands of unsuspecting computer owners. Then, they turn those machines into weapons, pointing a great deal of bogus traffic at a particular website in the hopes of overloading and crashing the target server.
	
But where are these attacks coming from? Responsibility for many of them has been claimed by the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters, which say they're unaffiliated with any government. However, according to United States government officials cited in a recent New York Times report, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam is likely a front for Iran's cyberwarfare efforts.  That makes some degree of sense: Iran has reason to be retaliating in cyberspace after it was hit with U.S. and Israel-backed computer viruses. The Times report claims the attacks' sophistication identifies them as state-sponsored. And the group's name is a reference to Iran-funded Hamas. 
			
""There is no doubt within the U.S. government that Iran is behind these attacks,"" James A. Lewis, a computer security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the Times.
	
But is Iran really the culprit here? Mashable reached out to several security experts for a second opinion. Roel Schouwenberg, senior researcher at Kaspersky Labs (which identified several recent cyberattacks against Iran), didn't confirm or deny the attacks' origins. However, he doesn't believe the attacks are so complicated they must be the work of a government.
	
“We can confirm that the attacks being reported are happening; however, the malware being used, known as ItsOKNoProblemBro, is far from sophisticated,"" wrote Schouwenberg in an e-mail. ""It's really rather simple. It’s also only one part of the puzzle but it seems to be effective, which is all that matters to the attackers. Going strictly by the publicly known technical details, we don't see enough evidence that would categorize this operation as something only a nation-state sponsored actor could pull off.”
	
Claudio Guarnieri, security researcher at Rapid7, agreed the complexity of the attacks is ""disputable"" and doesn't necessarily mean a government is behind them.
	
""The malicious code involved is effective but very simple,"" wrote Guarnieri. ""The link with state-sponsored entities could be justified by the fact that there is no direct gain for the attackers besides the disruption of the targets' operations. However, considering that there is no obvious evidence and that it could potentially be the work of generic cybercriminals, it's hard to confirm it.”

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/ishack-sustainable-living-south-africa/,iShack Brings Sustainable Living to South African Slums," Researchers at a South African University are putting a modern twist on a way of life for sub-Saharan shack dwellers.  The iShack, or improved shack, is designed to improve living conditions with solar panels for power and electricity. The prototype shack, located in a settlement outside Stellenbosch, South Africa, stands out from the typical rusty metal and wood dwellings.  A photovoltaic panel sits on the roof to power three lights, a motion sensitive exterior light and a cellphone charger. The floor is made of bricks from a local landfill, and the back wall is built from clay and hay to regulate temperature.  In an area with limited resources, the extended roof overhang helps to collect water, and even the windows are strategically placed for improved air circulation. Check out the video, above, for more details.  More than 60% of Africa's sub-Saharan urban population live in slums. Residents sometimes have to wait years for water or power infrastructure to reach their area.  SEE ALSO: Portable Solar Power Kits for Africa: Now in the U.S., via Kickstarter [VIDEO] Each iShack costs around $660, and researchers at the University of Stellenbosch are looking to make it as user and cost-friendly as possible.

The Treasury Secretary, among other more important duties (saving the economy, for instance), gets the privledge of having his signature on every piece of U.S. currency issued during his or her tenure. Lew's signature, however, is — ahem — unique:  That image came from a White House memo which circulated more than a year ago and was confirmed by Ryan Lizza to be Lew's actual signature. We're not really seeing ""Jack,"" ""Lew,"" or anything that might resemble characters in the English alphabet at all anywhere in there. But hey — it's worked for Lew so far.  So, assuming Lew is formally nominated by Obama, approved by the Senate and doesn't improve his John Hancock before starting as Treasury Secretary, we'll all be seeing a lot more of whatever this is.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/lifeway-kefir-social-media/,How an Ancient Beverage Found Fame on Social Media,"Its mysterious origin dates back thousands of years. Lore of the fermented dairy drink's seemingly magical health benefits endured through the generations by word-of-mouth. Then, social media raised it to royalty. Today, a company called Lifeway Foods makes close to $100 million annually selling kefir, a probiotic beverage often compared to yogurt. ""It took 2,000 years to bring this product into the mainstream through word-of-mouth,"" Lifeway's CEO Julie Smolyansky tells Mashable. ""Social just multiplies that so much, so rapidly."" Smolyansky's parents founded the Chicago-based company in 1986. When her father died in 2002, she took over as CEO at just 27 years old. According to Smolyansky, many close family friends believed Lifeway would not endure with her at the helm.  Defying both those expectations amidst a recession that touched nearly every part of the U.S. economy, Lifeway's sales have increased from $12 million to $80 million since 2002. At a time when unemployment became a national issue, somehow a company selling an obscure yogurt drink grew from 70 to more than 300 employees. Through good timing and by opportunistically embracing technology, Lifeway has been able to reach increasingly large audiences with its salubrious product and unique story.  The Smolyansky family slipped through a crease in the Iron Curtain and emigrated from the Ukraine in the 1970s. They settled in Chicago with notions of living The American Dream. ""They came to America because they were entrepreneurial, and that wasn't possible in the former Soviet Union,"" Smolyansky says.  The family opened a gourmet deli, stocking it with imported foods they would learn about from traveling to expos around the world. Julie Smolyansky calls her parents ""the first foodies"" because they carried products found in few other stores at that time, such as Nutella. SEE ALSO: 10 Instagram Foodie Accounts to Make Your Mouth Water
 While at a food show in Germany in 1985, Smolyansky's father, Michael Smolyansky, rediscovered a popular old-world beverage that had not yet made its way to America. The beverage was, of course, kefir. Being an engineer by trade, he decided to set up a factory to produce it in the U.S.  Kefir originated in the Caucasus Mountains, which range from the Black to Caspian Seas in Eurasia. Passed down by oral history, the recipe became popular in Russia during the late 19th century.  One makes it by adding kefir grains (which are not actually grains) to virtually any type of milk — even soy. The mixture should sit in the dark at a moderate temperature for about 24 hours. During that time it becomes fermented and slightly carbonated. Then, remove the grains (which can be reused) and consume the beverage as is, or let it sit for several more days, allowing it to further ferment and become more viscous and tart. The resulting beverage contains live bacteria, which many believe are beneficial, particularly to one's digestive system. The name ""kefir"" comes from a Turkish word meaning ""good feeling."" There is a mystique surrounding kefir. No one is 100% sure how the ""grains"" originated. One legend dictates the Prophet Muhammad gave the grains to the orthodox shepherds of the mountains, who then guarded the secret of the ""magic"" beverage. The grains themselves are a mix of bacteria and yeast that looks like the top of cauliflower.  Kefir grains are generally not used during mass production of the drink, but the producer can achieve a similar probiotic effect through a mixture of yeast and appropriate bacteria. Lifeway Foods does use kefir grains to grow cultures of bacteria, but cannot use the grain traditionally due to the large quantity the company produces daily. Lifeway's kefir also does not contain any alcohol. Initially, Lifeway spread its message by being in the right place at the right time. The family had fled the U.S.S.R. to start a business in America around the culmination of the Cold War. Smolyansky said the news media loved to tell her family's story; at the time, the country was ""fascinated"" with all things Russia.  ""At the same time, it was the perfect storm where health and natural foods were just starting to pick up,"" she says. In lieu of a marketing budget, Lifeway used the media attention to spread its message about the health benefits of kefir.  When Smolyansky found out about social media, she thought it was perfect for Lifeway. Now the company could reach out to people and tell its story on its own terms. She quickly signed up for MySpace in 2008, Twitter early in 2009 and Facebook later that year.  ""Everything that we do, we make sure that it's sharable,"" Smolyansky says. ""We become a friend and a trusted source of information."" At first, she managed the accounts herself, but Smolyansky quickly realized it would be a full-time job. She began looking for a community manager in 2009, before there was a common term for the position. Today, Lifeway employs a community staff of five, but Smolyansky says she remains involved in the social media strategy.  ""We want to do more and more of it,"" she says. ""You have to be everywhere."" The company has since joined Instagram, and Smolyansky even assembled a Pinterest board to elucidate Lifeway's journey. SEE ALSO: 5 Social Media Biz Strategies You'll See This Year
 If her father was still around, Smolyansky believes he would have loved social media as much as she does.  ""He would have been amazed. He was so fascinated with the Internet when it first launched,"" she says. The elder Smolyansky even bought the URL for ""Kefir.com,"" which now redirects you to Lifeway's official site. (Those shepherds are probably kicking themselves for letting that one slip through their fingers for the last 2,000 years.)  The company currently has more than 55,000 followers on Twitter and nearly 160,000 Likes on Facebook. Lifeway's social media clout is particularly impressive since kefir is a somewhat obscure product. While we often think of the Internet as a space for what's fresh and new, kefir helps to show that it is actually a space where anything worthwhile can succeed, from the ancient to the avant-garde.

This lightweight and thin overlay goes over the iPad's screen, so it feels more like a keyboard. In fact, the defined keys make it actually easy to look away from the screen when typing. It also lives in the iPad cover, so it folds into the cover when you don't want to use it.  Ah, tablet typing made easy. The AudiOffice by Invoxia -- which features a dock equipped with speakers for devices such as the iPhone, iPod and iPad -- works along with apps such as Skype and FaceTime. This combination allows businesses to communicate with others via video chat and cuts down on communication costs. The unit also takes being tied to a traditional computer out of the equation. Seagate drives for PC deliver easy-to-use, flexible protection for all your files -- including photos and videos from your social media accounts. This is also key for anyone who travels with an iPad and wants to access music, movies and more while on the road.  The Samsung 830 series may be about a year old, but it's still considered one of the best reviewed SSDs on the market. This slim solid-state drive boasts super-fast speeds -- up to 80,000 IOPS -- and can take web browsing, gaming and more to the next level. Mashable's Christina Warren has used the 830 for almost a year in her MacBook Pro and says it was the best tech investment she's ever made. Overall, if you are in the market for speed, Samsung's 830 series is worth the investment, especially if you have a more modern machine. If your business is among the many that supports both Windows machines and Macs, desktop simulators such as Parallels and VMware Fusion can help get all your computers running the same apps. For example, Parallels lets you run Windows on your Mac, and the trick is you can run both operating systems simultaneously, with your Windows apps showing up just like Mac apps would. Version 8 supports Mountain Lion features, such as dictation and notifications, for Windows apps. No one likes to carry around a phone charger, and similarly, there's nothing worse than watching your mobile device's battery slip away, especially when you're traveling for business. Thanks to smartphone cases with built-in batteries such as the Mophie Juice Pack Air ($79.95), it nearly doubles your battery life and is much more lightweight than other battery cases.  Video rigs such as the Steadicam Smoothee for the iPhone ($149) is a worthwhile investment, allowing small businesses to shoot video clips on the go with ease. Think of it as a table-top tripod. "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/mark-cuban-twitter-fine/,"Mark Cuban Fined $50,000 for Tweet","Dallas Mavericks owner and entrepreneurial icon Mark Cuban is in hot water with the NBA again, this time over some costly comments he made on Twitter.  The league fined Cuban $50,000 on Tuesday for a tweet he posted after his Mavericks lost at home to the lowly New Orleans Hornets on Saturday. Here is the tweet in question:  Im sorry NBA fans. Ive tried for 13 yrs to fix the officiating in this league and I have failed miserably. Any Suggestions ? I need help — Mark Cuban (@mcuban) January 6, 2013 The $50,000 fine comes out to just over $367 per character for the 136-character tweet, but that's just chump change to Cuban, whose net worth tops $2 billion. It's the rough equivalent of a $1 fine for someone earning $40,000 per year.  Cuban is also no stranger to the NBA dinging him for cash since he bought the Mavericks in 2000. According to the Dallas Morning News, he's been docked a total of some $2 million in the 13 years since.  Cuban is exceptionally outspoken and candid on Twitter for a billionaire sports team owner, so it's not entirely surprising that his tweeting thumbs — rather than his sharp tongue — did him in this time.  But for all that trash talk, there's one team's fan base he says he won't mess with online — the Los Angeles Lakers.  “There is more Twitter courage in Southern California than probably any other part of the world,"" Cuban said in November. “I could say ‘Kobe tied his shoe laces wrong’ and I’d probably get death threats on Twitter.” What do you think about the NBA fining Mark Cuban for his tweet — Right? Wrong? Too much? Too little? Give us your take in the comments.  Thumbnail image courtesy Flickr, Keith Allison "

Panasonic Has Two New Toughpads,"Panasonic has launched two new Toughpad tablets at the 2013 International CES show, one running Android and the other based on Windows 8 Pro.  The FZ-G1 (pictured above) runs Windows 8 Pro and is quite a powerful beast, with a 10-inch, 1,920x1,200 pixel display, a 1.9GHz Intel i5 processor, up to 8GB of RAM, a 128GB SSD, while the microSD slot is an option.  On the connectivity front, it packs USB 3.0 and 2.0 ports, wired LAN, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and — optionally — a Verizon LTE or 3G chip.  The Android-based JT-B1 (pictured below) sports a 7-inch, 1,024x600 display, a 1.5GHz dual-core processor, 1GB of RAM and 16GB of storage memory, further expandable via microSD cards. It also has a 13-megapixel camera on the back and a 1.3-megapixel one on the front.  As far as connectivity goes, it comes with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and an optional LTE+3G chip.   As is customary for Panasonic's Toughpad line of products, both tablets are resistant to drops, fluid ingress and extreme temperatures.  The difference in power is also reflected in the price, as the Toughpad FZ-G1 will cost $2,900 when it arrives in March, while its smaller Android brother comes in February and costs $1,300. "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/puzzlebox-orbit-helicopter-mind-control/,Brain-Controlled Puzzlebox Orbit Helicopter Makes Waves at CES,"If you think about it just enough, you can make a helicopter fly.  The Puzzlebox Orbit, which launched on Kickstarter last November and debuted Tuesday at the 2013 International CES conference in Las Vegas, is making waves with its brain-controlled helicopter toy. We saw it in person, and were tickled by the ease with which you could pilot the device. From NeuroSky — the same company behind the quirky brain-controlled Necomimi Cat Ears — the helicopter can actually move up and down via brainwaves.   Here's how it works: By wearing a Bluetooth headpiece with sensors, the Puzzlebox Orbit converts brainwave data into flight commands. The helicopter shoots into the air when you concentrate hard, and can be lowered when you relax the mind. Infrared signals are transferred to an accompanying iOS or Android app to measure your level of concentration. Users can set up focus-goals on the app ahead of time, and the controls work once your concentration reaches those sweet spots. The Puzzlebox Orbit also runs on an open-source platform, so developers can hack and personalize their experience. Price: $189.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/rfid-tracking-school/,Student Refusing to Wear RFID Chip Loses in Court,"A federal court has ruled that a Texas student who refuses to wear a school-mandated RFID tracking badge must at least wear an identification badge without a tracking chip or else change to a school without such a system. John Jay High School in San Antonio, Texas began requiring students to wear badges with RFID tags to track students' on-campus movements at the beginning of the fall semester.  Andrea Hernandez, 15, refused to wear the badge on religious grounds, claiming it was the ""mark of the beast,"" according to Wired. She was suspended for disobeying the new rule and later sued the district. A temporary injunction allowed her to continue her studies untracked. However, a federal court this week overturned that injunction after Hernandez refused the district's offer to allow her to wear a chip-less identification badge.  The court found the deal was ""reasonable"" and ""removed [Hernandez's] religious objection from legal scrutiny altogether."" Hernandez must now either wear the badge or transfer to a school without the program.  The Rutherford Institute, which is representing Hernandez, is planning an appeal to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Hernandez has been given until Jan. 18 to decide whether to don the badge or change schools. Hernandez's district, the Northside Independent School District, has two high schools experimenting with RFID tracking to get better data on class attendance rates, to which education funding is directly tied. The district has over a dozen high schools, though some are specialized towards teaching skills for particular careers. RFID chips use radio frequencies to transfer information between the chip and a receiver. They don't require line-of-sight, allowing them to be embedded within documents or even under skin. Thus, they're commonly used in new passports to track movement across borders and embedded into domestic pets for identification purposes. The use of RFID tags to track humans, however, has been the focus of many debates over personal privacy. For that reason, it's interesting that Hernandez argued against wearing the tag on religious and not privacy grounds. Should schools be able to track their students' movements around campus?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/robot-diaries-quit-smoking/,Comedian Quits Smoking by Drawing Robot Comics,"TaskRabbit is an e-commerce website where you'll find people to perform small tasks like removing decorations and pet sitting in exchange for money. And if you're aspiring comedian and illustrator Bryan Bruner, you'll also find a reason to quit smoking. Bruner, 36, was hired through TaskRabbit in April to assemble some Ikea furniture at the home of the marketing director for Healthline, a website that provides tips on health topics ranging from addiction to pregnancy. ""We started chatting and I showed her some of my robot drawings and she said, 'These are really good,'"" Bruner told the Daily Dot. ""About three weeks later I got a call from her telling me to come to her office to talk about an idea."" The idea was to use Bruner's illustrations in a 21-page comic featuring robot Ash Bender on a journey to quit smoking. The only catch was that Bruner would also have to quit smoking himself. ""I was like, no, you guys are a pain in the butt to work with and I'm going to smoke even more now,"" Bruner recalled.  Bruner finally came around shortly after New Year's and has since been smoke-free for about a week. In order to cope with the withdrawal, Bruner is encouraging others to quit by tweeting photos of themselves via Instagram using the hashtag #smokingrobots. Bruner will be selecting photos from Twitter through the rest of the week and turning them into robot illustrations (like the one he did for the Daily Dot, below). ""I definitely feel more energetic even though I haven't done much,"" Bruner said. ""Usually my house is a messy place but now it's like tweaker tight. Instead of just going outside and smoking a cigarette, I""m cleaning, mopping up. It's amazing when you fuck with the oxygen content in your blood, how much that changes you."" After 19 years worth of smoking and life, Bruner has changed a lot. Bruner grew up in Las Vegas as a dirt bike riding, punk rock music loving teen who was ""just trying to graduate high school."" ""When you're the first born, it is already intense. You're the prototype,"" Bruner said. ""My parents were really strict and I guess smoking was my sort of rebellion."" Bruner started smoking at the age of 17 and never looked back. After high school he moved to California to play college volleyball but ended up back in Vegas shortly after. He tried graphic art at a local Las Vegas college for about two semesters, but ultimately quit to become a construction worker, a foreman, and ""the next thing you know, I'm running parts of a big company all before I was 30.""  In 2008, Bruner sold his car and possessions and moved to New York to try his hand at stand-up comedy while staying on his manager's floor. While waiting for his sets, he would doodle to help fight the anxiety and panic attacks. Little did he know these doodles would ultimately help him quit smoking and probably save his life. ""[Smoking] was definitely not a smart decision,"" Bruner said. ""I think, it's more of a testament to what these damn robots have done for me. They've gotten me through a really hard breakup, relationship, and helped me quit smoking. All these robots need to do is help me make $10 and I'll be happy."" Illustrations by Bryan Bruner

Ruzzle, which was created by the Stockholm-based MAG Interactive, has topped AppData's chart of the top iOS apps and racked up 11 million users so far. According to MAG Interactive's Twitter stream, the growth has really picked up in the past few weeks: Ruzzle now has over 7 million players and is currently on the top ten list of all apps in the US App Store. Merry Christmas! — MAG Interactive (@maginteractive) December 21, 2012 Ruzzle just reached 10 million players! #ruzzle — MAG Interactive (@maginteractive) January 4, 2013 Ruzzle is now #1 overall in the US app store and has over 11 million players!! #ruzzle #appstore — MAG Interactive (@maginteractive) January 8, 2013 MAG also notes on its site that ""over 12 million players"" have downloaded the app. What's driving the growth is unclear. Ruzzle has been out since March 2012. As the Wall Street Journal's Digits blog notes, the game is ""strikingly similar"" to Zynga's Scramble With Friends, which came out almost exactly a year ago. Both games are a variation on Boggle, which challenge users to find words within a jumbled grid within a set amount of time. In the case of Ruzzle, the time limit is two minutes. Like Zynga's games, you can invite your Facebook friends to play with you.  According to AppData's chart, Scramble With Friends is not among the top 15 most-downloaded iOS apps. Ruzzle is also number five on AppData's list of Android apps. Scramble With Friends didn't crack the top 15 of that list, either. Image courtesy of MAG Interactive "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/samsung-4k-ultra-hd-content/,Samsung: 4K Ultra HD Content Will Come," LAS VEGAS — Samsung's massive 85-inch 4K Ultra HD TV is a thing of beauty. When you look at the screen, it's more like looking out a window — the images are that real. Even so, as we all watched Samsung introduce its latest line of cutting-edge electronics and appliances at CES 2013, we were all well aware that the on-screen video was specially prepared high-resolution footage, and 4K content has yet to arrive. Samsung promises that will change. Tim Baxter, President Samsung Electronics, is optimistic, but suggested patience. ""I think you'll see the content start to develop. It's not going to be an overnight proposition,"" he said. It's a familiar tale. HDTV's still deliver higher resolution output than most TV networks broadcast. To get the full benefit of your 1080p screen, you need to watch a Blu-ray movie. And let's not forget that early HD wars between Blu-ray and HD DVD further slowed down the HD content transition. While it's unlikely we'll see a replay of that scenario, Baxter does see parallels. He said, ""When HDTVs first hit the market, there was no content available."" The Samsung UN85S9000 UHD TV will face a similar situation when it's released. In the meantime, Baxter said the 4K sets will upgrade your HD content to the 3820 x 2160 screen resolution of Ultra HD TV. Baxter said that will serve as a bridge until the new content arrives. Samsung has yet to announce pricing and availability for the giant TV. Baxter also talked to Mashable about the personalization of technology and Samsung's quad-core-processor-sporting Evolution Kit TV Upgrade module. He said pricing has still not been set for the kit. Watch the video above for the full interview.
 
 Samsung's 2013 lineup of LED TVs are its brightest and slimmest yet. The bezel is just a quarter of an inch. This is 85-inches of 4K power. Samsung presented its press conference to a packed crowd. The Samsung NX300 is the world's first camera with an interchangeable 3D lens that shoots both stills and video. Samsung is offering an upgrade kit for its 2012 HDTVs to bring quad-core processing, better connectivity and a whole new interface. Editor-in-chief Lance Ulanoff and tech reporter Emily Price live blog the event. It's an ultra-thin, ultra-light, Ultrabook. The NX300 is Samsung's latest APS-CMOS Compact System Camera.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/samsung-dual-view-eyes-on/,Eyes-On With Samsung's Totally Crazy Dual-View TV,"LAS VEGAS — Of all the products on display at CES 2013, Samsung's dual-view OLED TV has the largest cool-to-perplexing ratio. Yes, it's incredible that two people can look at the same screen and watch totally different programs, but why would anyone ever want to do that? Conflicts over what to watch on TV are often sorted in one of three ways: Time-shift one of the programs via a DVR (or, going way back, videotape), and have the other person watch later. Get a second TV and flip a coin to see who goes to the other room. Fight it out. So why have a dual-view TV? A couple of reasons: If one TV in the home is clearly ""the best"" screen, the second TV may not be the best option, and sometimes schedules simply don't permit watching things later. Also, if one screen is the only place where a device resides (say, a game console), it may be difficult to move to another room. The gaming scenario is actually one of the best examples of a dual-view use case. Think two gamers playing together (or against each other) in a title like Call of Duty. Often this kind of scenario is handled with split-screens, but what if the two players could just don glasses to see their own full-screen POV — on the same screen? That would be awesome, but it would be only as good as the technology allows. I took a brief eyes-on look at Samsung's dual-view TV at CES, and if it becomes a product, there's nothing to worry about on the execution. Checking out two (count 'em!) 3D signals on the set, each looked super-sharp. Samsung says the TV is capable of delivering two separate views at full HD (1080p), and that definitely came across. The TV showed the hovering droplets of a slow-motion champagne uncorking (it was a demo reel) vividly. You need to wear special glasses (see the pic below) to see one signal or the other (to the naked eye, the picture looks terribly ghosted). Pushing a button on the top, the glasses toggle between the two signals quickly. There was sometimes a slight delay for the audio to catch up, but nothing major. The audio, however, was really terrible, but that's easily fixable with better earphones. The demo was a proof-of-concept, after all, and any final product would doubtless improve details like this. Though, for anyone who spent a lot of money on a great speaker system, relegating audio to glasses/headphones would really hurt. Samsung's dual-view OLED set may seem like a silly idea at first glance, but I wouldn't complain about it becoming a real product. There would be the whole question of formatting and software support, but the benefits, especially for gaming, could be well worth it.

The company says this new processor delivers twice the performance of its predecessor, Samsung's Exynos 4 Quad. This means new phones from Samsung are going to be noticeably faster. Announced by Dr. Stephen Woo, president of device solutions for Samsung, the processor includes two sets of four cores each. ""It's also smart enough to save energy when running certain tasks, too,"" Woo said. Samsung said it is focusing on three areas: processing, memory and display technology. ""There are more than 6 billion mobile devices in use and more than a half a billion smartphones sold. As users become more attached to devices, they become more sophisticated in their devices. They notice a difference in weight, size and form factor."" What is driving these advancements? Their components,"" Woo said to a packed room. ""As a consumer you don't think about components often, but that is okay ... if you want to see where the real action is and where the industry is going, you have to pull back that layer to where the magic happens.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/scandal-people-defend-brands/,"Even Amid Scandal, People Will Defend Their Favorite Brands","What happens when your beloved brand runs into public relations trouble? A public scandal or major mishap, perhaps? If you're really in love with the brand, you'll stand by it, researchers say. In fact, new research finds that people are more likely to defend that brand when they have a personal connection with it. To prove this, Angela Y. Lee, a professor of marketing at the Kellogg School of Management, Monika Lisjak, a doctoral candidate at the Kellogg School, and Wendi L. Gardner, an associate professor of psychology at Northwestern University, examined the relationships people have with brands in a series of experiments. The research consisted of four experiments involving both Starbucks and Facebook, which were chosen because of past controversies. The researchers wanted to know how willing people were to stick with a favorite brand even in tough times. ""If you believe that a brand is part of you, and you read something negative about it, how are you going to react?"" asked Lee. ""Are you going to stop using it? Or do you use it even more? A brand is very intangible — in a way, the brand goes even beyond the product itself or the actual object. So from a psychological perspective, it's interesting to consider the dynamic relationship between a consumer and the brands that they consume."" The researchers found that people were actually more likely to defend brands even after controversy. In particular researchers found that self-conscious, low self-esteem individuals were most likely to rate companies more favorably after critiques and controversy.  The only caveat to that research is that people rated brands less favorably after changing focus to other areas of their lives where they can affirm themselves.  ""If Starbucks is part of you, and you read something negative about Starbucks, you feel attacked,"" said Lee. ""But I now give you another way to feel good about yourself. Then, once that need is being satisfied, you may not feel that you need to defend Starbucks anymore."" Photo courtesy of Flickr, Mike Saechang

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/smart-home-phone/,Your Landline Could Get a Second Life With 'The Home Phone'," Dust off that landline — household phones may be making a comeback with a new Kickstarter project.  The Home Phone, designed by French husband and wife team UrbanHello, is a smartphone for the whole family, allowing shared conversations with its automatic hands-free mode. When placed on a surface, the 360-degree loudspeaker activates, and its use reduces electromagnetic wave exposure by 99%.  You may not trade your iPhone in just yet, but the Home Phone's sleek, modern design and HD sound is a minimalist alternative to bulky, cordless home devices on the market.  ""It's a device which is so beautiful it can be given to someone as a present just like a bouquet of flowers,"" Herve and Catherine Artus say on their Kickstarter page.  With a keypad hidden at the bottom and two discreet OLED displays at either end, it doesn't even look like a phone. Check out the video, above, for more.  UrbanHello's Kickstarter campaign launched Jan. 6 after winning the ""Innovations Award"" at CES 2013 in Las Vegas.  After two days, the project has reached $23,152 of its $160,390 goal.  Backers have until Feb. 14 to fund the project and get their own Home Phone at a discounted price. Without the discount, it'll cost an estimated $169 when the product launches.  Don't remember how to use a landline? Like most house phones, the Home Phone charges on its base, and can be plugged into an existing phone line with its connector. The ""new generation of home phones"" also stores up to 20 contacts and displays caller ID on both screens.  Do you think this reinvention can save household phones?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/soccer-stars-twitter-infographic/,Soccer Stars on Twitter: Who Follows Whom?,"Like most major sports these days, soccer fans, players and clubs have an active presence on Twitter. Stars use the network to connect with fans — and sometimes get in a bit of hot water. Fans use it to debate matchups and strategies — but have also found themselves arrested and even thrown in jail for getting too out of control. And clubs use the network to reward loyal followers, and keep up in the world of digital marketing.  The infographic below, which comes by way of the online-betting site Unibet, takes a deeper look at Twitter's soccer landscape. It delves into which players have the most Twitter followers (and how that relates to their financial value), which clubs have the most success attracting followers and, most interestingly, who the top stars do and don't follow online.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/verizon-q4-smartphone-activations/,"Verizon Activated 9.8 Million Smartphones in Q4, Its Most Ever","Verizon announced Wednesday that it expects to have activated nearly 10 million smartphones in the fourth quarter, making this its strongest quarter yet for smartphone sales. The company revealed in an SEC filing that it expects smartphone activations to total 9.8 million for the quarter thanks in part to a ""higher mix of Apple smartphones."" The announcement comes one day after AT&T said it sold a record 10 million smartphones in the quarter. It's like that sales for both carriers were helped by the launch of the iPhone 5, which was released in September.  It's important to note that the total number of activations may not perfectly translate to the total number of sales, as one can activate a contract on an old phone without buying that device from the carrier. More details will likely come out when the companies release their quarterly earnings reports later this month. Verizon is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 22 and AT&T is scheduled to report its earning on Jan. 24. Image courtesy of Flickr, Eric Hauser "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/why-eric-schmidt-is-in-north-korea/,We Now Know Why Eric Schmidt is in North Korea,"Much controversy and mystery has surrounded Google's Eric Schmidt and former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson's trip to North Korea. U.S. officials have criticized it, calling it ill-timed given the regime's allegedly illegal launch of a satellite last month. And ever since the first rumors about the trip came out, it hasn't been clear what its purpose was, with Richardson simply calling it a ""private humanitarian trip.""  For Google's executive chairman, it turns out the endeavor was all about Internet freedom.  Schmidt and Richardson told the Associated Press that they are in North Korea to urge regime officials to open up its citizen's access to the Internet and to cellphones. Richardson also said they're asking Pyongyang to halt their missile launches and nuclear tests as well as give a fair treatment to an American citizen detained in the country. While it wasn't confirmed, the revelation of Schmidt's intentions comes as no surprise. Google has been a proponent of Internet freedom for a long time now, both in the United States (remember its strong stance against SOPA and PIPA?) and abroad (see Google and China's standoff over the communist's regime censorship practices.) SEE ALSO:  North Korea's Official Website Costs About $15
 Schmidt himself has been a vocal supporter of Internet freedom and access. In fact, he has a book coming out titled The New Digital Age: Reshaping the Future of People, Nations and Business, written along with Google Ideas think tank director Jared Cohen. The book will explain how Internet access will change society for the better. Schmidt and the American delegation hope to dissuade the regime led by the 29-year old Kim Jong-Un to ease up its strict rules on Internet access. Currently, the vast majority of North Koreans have no access to the general Internet, and can only enter the country's intranet, that allows them to visit only stare-run media and government-approved websites.  Schmidt's visit has already prompted rumors that indicate the regime might be willing to allow a freer access to the World Wide Web.  Photo via JUNG YEON-JE/AFP/Getty Images "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/09/withings-smart-activity-tracker/,Withings Smart Activity Tracker Is First to Record Heart Rate,"Smart fitness technology company Withing announced a new product at International CES 2013 — the Smart Activity Tracker. The little device can fit into your pocket or attach to the included belt clip or arm band.  Using Bluetooth and Bluetooth Smart technology, the tracker communicates with the Withings Health Mate app. The front of the tracker has a touch surface on which you can navigate from various screens. Simply press your finger to the back of the device to record your heart rate. This is the first time we've seen a pulse measurement on a tracking device. So in addition to monitoring your steps, distance, calories, strides and quality of sleep, you'll be able to read your heart rate during those activities.   SEE ALSO: Withings Scale Monitors Temperature and CO2 Levels in Your Home As that information is recorded, it syncs to the app, so you can follow your progress in real time.  You can also use the tracker to get a bit of motivation if you're feeling sluggish: Set up smartphone alerts to let you know if you've been inactive for too long (a great idea if you work at a desk).  The Withings Smart Activity Tracker has a two-week battery life and an on-board micro USB port for recharging.    The information the tracker collects can be shared with your social networks and you might be inclined to share that data with a doctor, too.  The tracker and app are available for Android devices, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPad and iTouch 4 and 5.

Formerly a Nickelodeon star, Draper is now CEO of Valley Girl, where she oversees the show and runs technology blog Lalawag.com. Customer service can make or break businesses. Plenty of companies get it right, like Zappos. But even more companies get it wrong.  How many times have you repeated the same problem over and over to your TV service provider or phone company's customer service representative? They appear to have no way of tracking your initial complaint. And everyone has at some point emailed a complaint. Did said company respond? Probably not. Zendesk has recently become the secret to everyone's customer service issues. With 300 customer service employees, the cloud-based help desk software startup helps companies provide the best possible customer service.  It’s all about using technology to help keep customers happy, and it’s working. Today, more than 100 million people in 140 countries get their customer service through Zendesk’s 25,000-plus customers, which includes companies ranging from Gilt Groupe and Box.net, to Disney, GroupOn and Airbnb. Zendesk recently raised $60 million of new funding. In an exclusive interview with Zendesk’s CEO, Mikkel Svane, we asked him what he thought was the secret to great customer service. He says it’s about building a relationship with your customers based on responsiveness.  ""When somebody asks you something, make sure they get an answer quickly,"" he says. In addition, he mentions creating trust through honesty. He acknowledges that dealing with customers effectively can be a challenge, which is why they developed their technology in the first place.  ""Like everybody who’s ever spent time in a call center and a help desk knows, spending your entire day just dealing with customer issues and customer problems – people crying, people celebrating, people yelling at you – it’s really, really hard,"" he says.

 And when there's a mention of poop, a flood of Internet jokes, videos and memes will follow. Seriously, no amount of Imodium could stop it.  YouTube user Andrew Frederick flushes out a beat to the potty humor with ""I Pooped in my Pants (The Dookie Dance)."" It will certainly make a splash on the Internet. (Sorry.) BONUS: When the News Breaks: 15 On-Air Flubs  After a comment from Savannah Guthrie about the old Catholic school adage that one should leave ""enough space for the holy ghost to pass through"" while dancing, Mr. Roker simply freezes and holds his facial expression.  It's pretty bizarre and has sparked a lot of controversy on Reddit.  There is a tender moment between when the cameras begin rolling and when the feed gets pumped into the homes of viewers.  Sometimes, reporters forget about this gap and say something a bit silly.  We're all familiar with the aggressive reporter that hounds an alleged scammer or particularly flighty interview subject. It was only a matter of time before an incident like this surfaced.  As an on location reporter, it makes for better TV if one can get as close as possible to the story.  For this reporter and his legs, he was clearly a little too close. Possibly learning from the prior reporter, these two sports anchors set up their desk out of the field of play. At least they thought it was far enough away.  The quality of wrong place, wrong time for this incident is pretty uncanny. There's a lot of controversy around this video's veracity. It's hard to tell if the accident was staged or not. There are several clues that point to it being staged, but we may never know. People will do anything to get on TV. This video proves that reporters will do anything to keep obnoxious people off TV.  This genre of blooper is quite pervasive on the web. It seems that despite their on-air professionalism and journalism pedigree, primary school humor still can break the most seasoned of reporters. Not sure how this would go over in the states, but clearly this Aussie reporter is delighted with her clever zinger. We acknowledge - as we're sure the reporter and producer did who set this up - that seeing an expert snake handler interact with a complete novice on live TV is bound for a golden YouTube moment. If you hold a cat making this sound and think it's ""having fun,"" you're gonna have a bad time. Morning news shows are known for doing quirky things to capture viewers. The idea to have a man with a water-powered jetpack introduce a segment must have seemed like a good idea at some point, right? Venerated New York City anchor forgets the rule about waiting a few seconds to make sure the feed isn't live before dropping f-bombs.  We're sure this must have cost her and the station a pretty penny, but at least she made right and apologized to her viewers. Not only one of the funniest news fails, but one of the funniest fails in general.  Thankfully the reporter turned out to be okay, but the look of shared pain of the reporters in studio and the gutteral moans and exhortations of this poor woman made it an instant classic, even being parodied on Family Guy This has to be one of the most famous meltdowns caught on tape.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/amazon-autorip/,Amazon's AutoRip Gives You Free MP3s for CDs You've Purchased,"Amazon has launched AutoRip, a service that gives customers free MP3 versions of CDs they've purchased anytime since 1998.  Even better, customers who purchase a new CD will receive their digital copy before the actual, physical CD arrives at their doorstep.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/amazon-free-movies-books/,Why Amazon Won't Give You Free Digital Copies of Your Movies and Books,"Amazon announced Thursday morning that any customer who purchases a CD will receive a free digital copy of that album. The offer is valid not only on present and future purchases, but on any one of 50,000 CDs purchased from the retailer since 1998. Could the same offer soon be extended to movies and books? The answer, unfortunately, is probably not. The first issue is cost. Sarah Rotman Epps, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, says Amazon has sold so many books they couldn't feasibly afford to subsidize e-book copies of past (nor, for that matter, future) purchases; the number of CDs Amazon has sold is, by comparison, marginal. Plus, ""publishers have learned the mistakes of music companies and aren't giving away their revenues so easily,"" says Epps. ""If Amazon wanted to do something like this for books, publishers would make them pay through the nose."" Although DVD and Blu-ray sales are also marginal compared to books, they constitute a substantially bigger market than CDs, and will remain that way. But the second, and primary, reason is lack of competition. Amazon is fighting desperately to get consumers to think of its website — and not Apple's iTunes — as the go-to destination for music purchases. Over the past two years, Amazon has aggressively discounted popular album releases, going so far as to offer Lady Gaga's Born This Way album for $0.99 download when it was released in May 2011. The offer was so popular that Amazon's servers were stalled for most of the day. However, it's possible that customers may one day be able to purchase physical and digital copies of books and movies in a single bundle. For a few extra dollars, you could, for example, purchase a hardback that has a validation code for an e-book copy on the back. Indeed, Epps says Forrester has made that recommendation to publishers many times. The firm's research shows that though readers enjoy the portability and convenience of e-books, many would prefer to engage with a print book at home. A studio-backed system called UltraViolet is advocating for a similar system for video, enabling consumers to get automatic access to digital, cloud-stored copies of any TV or movie purchased in hard form. So what's holding them back? The entertainment industry is moving ahead, but publishers simply move more slowly. What's perhaps more interesting about the announcement is just how far Amazon has shown it's willing to go to beat Apple.

But that won't curb our appetite for apocalyptic games. The folks over at gametoaid.org have launched another three-day game-a-thon for charity. Tune in to #Apocalyptathon, a live, nine-game spree benefiting Free The Children, a non-profit that builds schools in developing countries. All the games on the docket play on apocalyptic themes. ""If we reach our goal of $8,500, Free The Children will be able to build a schoolhouse in one of the countries that they work in,"" says Toby Zerner of GameToAid. ""We'll let our viewers choose where."" Also, PRIZES. For every $5 donated, you'll be entered in a raffle to win copies of fan favorites like Borderlands and Super Meat Boy. The grand prize, which will be drawn at the 72-hour mark, is a shiny new Nintendo Wii-U. GameToAid also added a referral program. Tell your friends about the fundraiser, and every $10 they donate gets you another raffle ticket. The apocalyptic games on tap are: Half-Life 2 (PC) Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask (N64) Doom (PC) Resident Evil 4 (GameCube) Darksiders (PC) Zombies Ate My Neighbords (SNES) Left 4 Dead 2 (PC) Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse (NES) Halo: Combat Evolved (Xbox) As of this writing, GameToAid has raised $1,063.

Before the update, app developers were able to change screenshots of their apps after they've been published in the App Store. While updating screenshots may be a legitimate way to reflect new iterations of an app, some developers combined names similar to other titles with screenshots taken directly from other apps to dupe customers into spending money on, essentially, fakes.  An example of this tactic is an app called ""Mooncraft,"" which leads customers to believe that they are buying a version of the popular game, ""Minecraft.""   Developers will still be able to update screenshots for their apps, but only during updates. ""Beginning January 9, app screenshots will be locked in iTunes Connect once your app has been approved. New screenshots may be uploaded when you submit a binary for an update to an existing app or a new app,"" Apple announced on Wednesday.  Image courtesy of iStockphoto, Nikada "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/axe-buzz-aldrin-space-contest/,Axe Body Spray Will Send 22 People to Space,"The men's personal care product company Axe has teamed up with famed moonwalker Buzz Aldrin to send 22 people into space, and make sure they smell nice doing it. On Jan. 9, the company kicked off its new Axe Apollo Space Academy, an online contest that promises to send 22 winners to the edge of space and back aboard a private spaceship. The winning space travelers will launch aboard a suborbital Lynx space plane built by the U.S. company XCOR Aerospace and operated by the tourism firm Space Expedition Curacao, Axe officials said. ""Space travel for everyone is the next frontier in the human experience,"" Buzz Aldrin, who became the second person ever to walk on the moon during NASA's 1969 Apollo 11 mission in 1969, said in a statement. ""I'm thrilled that Axe is giving the young people of today such an extraordinary opportunity to experience some of what I've encountered in space."" The contest is open to men and women in more than 60 countries who sign up on the Axe Apollo Space Academy website (AXEApollo.com) and write about why they should be chosen to fly in space, while others will vote on the entries. The deadline to enter is Feb. 3.  SEE ALSO: How Lynx Spaceships Will Launch (Video) The 22 winners will be selected during the Axe Global Space Camp in Orlando, Fla., which will feature competitive ""space-simulation challenges,"" Axe officials said. Winning space travelers will fly, one at a time, aboard Lynx space planes once Space Expedition Curacao begins operational flights. The reusable space planes are designed to fly two people — one pilot and a passenger — to an altitude of 62 miles (100 kilometers) during suborbital flights. The rocket plane is built to take off and land horizontally on a runway. Space Expedition Curacao will oversee commercial Lynx flights from the Caribbean island of Curacao. Tickets for a flight are set at $95,000. XCOR Aerospace is expected to begin the first test flights of a high-altitude Lynx design sometime later this year. The first passenger flights could begin in 2014. Axe's deodorant body sprays are apparently known as Lynx in some parts of the world, so booking seats on a space plane with the same name was no giant leap, company officials explained. ""The Axe Apollo launch is the biggest and most ambitious in the Axe brand's 30-year history,"" Axe's global vice president Tomas Marcenaro said. ""For the first time, we're simultaneously launching one global competition in over 60 countries offering millions of people the opportunity to win the most epic prize on Earth. A trip to space — yes, actual space."" Image courtesy of NASA

Developed by researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration IZM in Berlin, the system features a stretchable printed circuit board made of polyurethane. The discreet circuit board fits to the contours of the body and alerts parents as soon as their child stops breathing. It's manufactured using routine industrial processes, meaning that it should be inexpensive if it eventually hits commercial shelves.  ""The circuit board we have developed can be manufactured using routine industrial processes, meaning a high throughput and, consequently, good cost-efficiency,"" says IZM scientist Manuel Seckel. ""Furthermore, components can be positioned on it just as precisely as on a standard board thanks to the stability of the stretchable substrate during processing. This stands in contrast to textile-based electronics, where one can expect an offset of up to five millimeters over a half-meter area.""

Previously, it's been fans who create the animated looping recaps, but brands are catching on to the appeal. Cinemax's newest series, Banshee, premieres its first episode through a series of GIFs, served like chapters in a book.   They can also be viewed on the official Tumblr site, the Banshee GIF shop, created by New York agency Campfire. The GIF series is part of a creative partnership with BuzzFeed.  Viewers will have access to the ""most intriguing and provocative moments"" in the GIF shop, Cinemax said in a statement. The GIFs are categorized so that users can use them as reactions, such as ""OMG,"" ""LOL"" or ""WTF"" — part of a larger trend that replaces emoticons in conversation with the animated format. SEE ALSO: The 5 Most GIF-Worthy Shows on TV Banshee, the latest work of True Blood creator Alan Ball, features an ex-con and master thief (Antony Starr, Rush) who assumes the identity of a sheriff in Banshee, Pa.

A website filled with more back-stories, interactive videos and other extras will launch in conjunction with the premiere. Viewers will be able to unlock more content as the season rolls out.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/bookacoach/,Bookacoach Helps You Find a Sports Coach You Can Trust,"Playing sports has become a standard a rite of childhood passage for most kids, right up there with learning to tie a shoe and snagging that first kiss. But disturbing news events increasingly create anxiety for parents — how can you be sure a coach actually knows what they're doing? Or worse, what if they're actually a predator hidden behind a helpful, athletic facade?  The startup bookacoach aims to quell that anxiety for parents, keep kids safe and allow coaches to quickly and easily verify their credibility.  Bookacoach is a web app that allows kids and parents to book private lessons with coaches who have signed up with the service. To become a member of the site, however, coaches must undergo annual background checks, meaning you know you'll be leaving your kid in safe, responsible hands.  “It’s our mission and number one priority to become the safest place to find quality coaches,” says co-founder and CEO Kevin MacCauley. But bookacoach adds value beyond just background checks. Parents can schedule lessons and pay for them online, as well as post coach reviews to help families looking for instruction later on.  The site is currently free for coaches to use, but parents are charged a 10% transaction fee on lessons they book through the site. Bookacoach was originally founded in the fall of 2011 by MacCauley, Myles Grote and Marcus Gross, but just launched in late December with a formal announcement going out just this week. Since becoming live, the site has signed up more than 100 coaches from eight states, according to Grote.  Bookacoach is actually just one of a number of examples where technology is helping to bring new efficiency and safety to youth sports. The mobile app GameChanger lets coaches apply Moneyball style analytics to kids' basketball and baseball teams. Later this year, helmet-maker Riddell will introduce a product that tracks, measures and reports the blows kids' heads sustain in pee wee football.  Thumbnail image courtesy Flickr, dpstyles "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/ces-booth-babes/,This Picture Shows Everything Wrong With 'Booth Babes' at CES,"'Booth babes' have been one of the more unfortunate features of tech trade shows for years. Women (we've never seen any male booth babes) chosen for their looks are paid to hang around a company's booth and attract the mostly male, mostly older attendees.  Sometimes the women are well paid, sometimes they get minimum wage, but their relationship to the product in question is usually gossamer-thin.  We've seen some fairly egregious examples over the years, but none more so than the one our tech reporter Emily Price stumbled upon at CES in Las Vegas Thursday. Four women dressed in body paint and little else were displayed at a company's booth, like sculptures.  The women looked straight ahead with bored expressions, and were not allowed to interact with attendees. The company's own Instagram feed described them as ""fembots."" It was not immediately clear how this display was supposed to relate to the product in question, a hard drive. We won't give the company the satisfaction of mentioning their name, but we have reached out to them (and the CEA) for comment. After Emily posted the picture on Twitter, it received more than 350 retweets — and many more outraged responses: @emily @thebloggess How? What? Huh?

They have also been racing against each other as part of Mashable's CES Challenge. All of our team members at CES are wearing Nike+ Fuelbands, allowing us to track their activity throughout the show.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/cheaper-iphone-cost/,"Cheaper iPhone Would Cost $99 to $149, Report Says","Apple's rumored cheaper iPhone would cost anywhere from $99 to $149, according to a new report. The device, which would debut in late 2013 ""at the earliest,"" is part of an effort to attract more customers from developing markets, Bloomberg reported, citing an unnamed source. Among them, Apple is particularly eyeing China. Last December, CEO Tim Cook said the country is ""a very important market for us."" At the time, Apple had sold more than 2 million units of the iPhone in China, setting a record for best first-weekend sales in the country. SEE ALSO: Apple Unveils iPhone 5, Finally
 A lower-cost version of the iPhone would also help Apple compete with Google's Android phones, which are available in a wide range of prices.  As one of the mobile market's pricier smartphones, the iPhone 5 starts at $199 for 16GB of storage with a two-year contract. There are also 32GB and 64GB models available for $299 and $399, respectively. In terms of its older phones, Apple now offers the 8GB iPhone 4 for free, while the 16GB iPhone 4S costs $99 (both requiring two-year contracts).  The company has been developing a more affordable phone since ""at least"" February 2011, Bloomberg said. It has spoken to one or more major U.S. wireless carriers about its plans, the newspaper added. Earlier reports suggested that the lower-cost iPhone would look like a standard iPhone 5, but made with cheaper materials. Polycarbonate would replace the aluminum shell, and other components could be sourced from parts designed for older iPhones. What do you think of the rumored cheaper iPhone's price range?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/chilly-gonzales-ipad/,How One Musician Overcame Apple's 'One Hit Wonder' Effect,"Chilly Gonzales has been many things over his 15+ years as a music professional. The thing you may know him for most, without even realizing it? He helped sell the first iPad.  In 2010, Apple approached Gonzales about using his song ""Never Stop"" in a run of commercials for the device that would become synonymous with tablet computing.   The way Gonzales tells it, ""Never Stop"" was barely available when Apple expressed interest in using it.  ""The song had only been out on vinyl, and had only been bootlegged in a digital version for five or six days before it got on their radar,"" he says. ""They didn't even have a proper MP3 of the song, just a rip that someone had done from the vinyl, analog into their computer. You had to really be on the ball to know that song existed, and they were on it within days.""  An Apple commercial can be a career-defining moment for a lesser-known artist. But at worst, it can also mean a death knell. Who wants to be known as a one-hit wonder whose only hit — remember the Caesars? — was for a TV ad?  While he is appreciative of the project for its exposure, Gonzales considers it just another part of his diverse career, which includes work with Drake, Feist and Peaches.  ""I realized that the album was never going to be at the top of my pyramid,"" he says. ""The brand itself was the top of the pyramid, and albums can be a part of that as can performances, as can interviews, as can putting videos out on social media. But not one of those things is the product anymore. The product is your reputation."" SEE ALSO: Beck's New DIY Album Spawns Social Media Collaboration
 He is, in a way, an artist perfectly suited for the social media era. He is obsessed with his brand not as a means to support and promote his music, but just as a part of it. Consider, for example, that in 2009 he embarked on a Guinness World Record breaking performance: He played piano for just over 27 hours.  This might not seem like a good idea for anyone, but for Gonzales the timing couldn't have been better. ""We were very early on the streaming bandwagon, because Ustream had just started up a few months before that project. We were one of the first people to do a multi-camera streaming event on Ustream,"" he says.  ""I opened up my Twitter account scant days before ... and we ended up being the second-highest worldwide trend over those 24 hours.""  Despite his myriad efforts across social platforms, he spends the most time on Twitter (and does so completely autonomously); he praises Twitter for its simplicity. In fact, it's the one platform he recommends to musicians trying to cut through the noise and reach an audience. ""It's something you can do every day. It doesn't require a lot of maintenance,"" he says. ""It's the minimum amount of effort and a maximum amount of marketing, disguised as access."" Gonzalez has always experienced both luck and risk. In 2004, ready to move away from his ""conceptual electronic stuff and crazy concerts,"" he composed and released a record simply titled Solo Piano.  Stylistically, it was at the polar opposite of his previous work as a producer and rapper. And yet it had something in common: It was not what anyone expected of him. ""It was a great success, in fact, bigger than any of the underground records I'd done,"" he says. ""So instead of doing a second Solo Piano right away, which might've been a good way to cash in on that, I learned the counter-intuitive lesson, which is to keep taking risks, keep on moving forward, keep on being more and more like myself, and then wait for the right time.""  The right time, it turned out, would be 2012. Solo Piano II came out in August. This time, the goal is to take piano music and bring it to the attention economy.  ""I'm the guy that turned piano into the musical voice of the iPad. It's very encouraging to me that piano can be updated and brought into the present.""   In this new era of his career, he'll make a series of simple videos showing off just his hands playing the keys. But he'll also take the stage for a performance in a bathrobe and slippers, referencing the signature absurdity from other parts of his music. ""A lot of people who play only the piano are at a disadvantage because they haven't put in the effort to connect with their generation,"" he says. ""To me, that was the most important reason why I came out of music school and I turned my back on it. I wanted hot girls and hip-hop heads in my audience, and I worked my ass of to get to the point where they are.""  Photo by Alexandre Isard, courtesy of Shore Fire Media "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/computing-desktops-federal-agencies/,Mobile Is Changing the PC Culture at Federal Agencies,"Federal agencies are facing substantial outlays to manage mobile computing devices as they shift from a culture of PCs and laptops to smartphones and tablets. But there is a silver lining. Agencies are likely to save money if they don’t have to maintain their own systems to secure and support employee mobile devices. And vendors offer discounts for volume purchases of their software and services.                     Providers of mobile device management tools—including Atlanta-based AirWatch, MobileIron of Mountain View, Calif., and Zenprise of Redwood City, Calif.—charge between $3 and $4 per month for client software installed on an employee’s mobile phone or tablet. AirWatch is a supplier on the Veterans Affairs Department’s initial $4.4 million mobile contract awarded in October. That monthly fee may seem like small change until it’s applied somewhere like the Defense Department, where planners are looking to move every active-duty and reserve organization to mobile computing. Defense’s workforce includes 1.4 million active-duty troops, 1.3 million National Guard and reserve personnel, and 800,000 civilian employees—that’s 3.5 million people. If everyone in the department needed a mobile device—the Defense Information Systems Agency envisions widespread use—at $3 a month the Pentagon would face an annual tab of $126 million, and at $4 a month the cost would be $168 million a year for the necessary software. VA could end up with a bill between $10 million and $14 million annually to provide mobile support to its workforce of 300,000. Providers offer perpetual client licenses for about $50 apiece, which in the case of Defense would result in a one-time cost of $75 million, and at VA, the tab would be $15 million. Mobile device management vendors sell both cloud-based services and in-house network support.  Some companies, including AirWatch, do not charge annual maintenance fees for mobile services based in the cloud. But if an agency chooses to host the software itself annual maintenance and support fees could run about 20% of the contract cost. For Defense, annual support costs could range from $24 million to $32 million. Hardware and software charges to set up department servers average about $20,000, and about $30,000 for cloud-based service. But large agencies shouldn’t expect to pay list prices for mobile client licenses, software and services, according to AirWatch chairman Alan Dabbiere and Chandra Sekar, director of vertical product marketing for Zenprise. They say large-scale deployments would net substantial discounts.  The Pentagon could qualify for a 30% discount, based on volume, according to Bernie Skoch, a technology consultant and retired Air Force general who did a tour at DISA. While still a stiff bill, the department could make it up in savings generated from not having to develop its own systems, he says, such as expensive tactical command-and-control networks. Skoch says he has no doubt commercial smartphones and tablets will become a key part of tactical systems. Warren Suss, president of Suss Consulting, says a Defensewide purchase of mobile management software will “not be cheap.” He says the smart approach would be to phase in tablets as the inventory of desktop PCs and laptops reach the end of their life cycle. The real savings, Suss and Skoch agree, would come from replacing tactical radios, which can cost $70,000 apiece. Commercial gear that costs $500 or less and requires a minimal monthly fee for client software can look like a bargain in comparison.  Vendors say they offer sophisticated software for securely managing and controlling smartphones and tablets, coupled with a private app store for users. Access to these apps, in most cases, is governed by role-based permissions set in an enterprise’s active directory. Ojas Rege, vice president of strategy for MobileIron, says the company’s system walls off the most sensitive apps from employees who are not authorized to use them, and even access to commercial apps is routed through its private app store. Zenprise mobile software allows users to access commercial app stores, but can detect and inhibit installation of apps forbidden by agency information technology managers. AirWatch has built geolocation software into its mobility software, allowing IT managers to track where a mobile device is being used and to shut it down if it appears to have been stolen. The company also provides IT managers with what could be viewed as the nuclear deterrent of mobile computing—the ability to remotely and automatically wipe a smartphone or tablet of all data if an employee violates policies on commercial apps and security. This includes devices owned by employees. MobileIron and Zenprise offer similar features. As agencies develop bring-your-own-device policies, Dabbiere says the Office of Management and Budget should offer guidance on who must pay for client software on personal devices—employees or their agencies.  In January, the Health and Human Services Department released its mobile strategy, which expects employees to pay for mobility management software for their personally owned devices.  Despite the substantial cost of mobility management software, DISA has made it clear it must adopt new guidelines for mobile wireless computing, based on a cohesive enterprisewide strategy. DISA officials say Defense must embrace mobility management tools to ensure military users don’t lag behind the private sector in secure mobile computing capability worldwide.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/creepy-robotic-spider-dress/,This Robotic Spider Dress Will Make Your Skin Crawl," As if spiders weren't creepy enough on their own, now you can wear one. High-tech fashion designer Anouk Wipprecht created an unsettling robotic spider dress, complete with animatronic arachnid limbs that jerk and twitch.  Teaming up with Austrian software developer and hacker, Daniel Schatzmayr, Wipprecht makes hexapods haute. The dress has six robotic legs on its shoulder pads which respond to nearby movement.  If anyone gets too close, the limbs move in closer to protect the wearer and keep strangers at bay (because everyone wants to snuggle up to someone decked out like an insect). Check out the video, above, for more.   The Dutch-based designer showcased her dress at Cafe Neu Romance, an international robot performance festival in Prague, in November 2012. On her bio page, Wipprecht describes herself as ""part futuristic, part anime-meets-high fashion"" and pushes the boundaries between the physical and psychological.  With the Spider Dress, Wipprecht explores the ideas of personal space, control and privacy. She describes it as a ""cute little host creature"" in her YouTube video, where warped voices set the track for the spider legs in action.   SEE ALSO: These Futuristic Shoes Breathe and Ignite Her other out-of-the-ordinary designs include dresses with plastic tubes, fluids, inks and smart foils. The Daredroid is a cocktail-making robot dress, while Wipprecht's Intimacy line features dresses that become transparent based on the wearer's sensual interactions. The e-foils on Intimacy dresses respond to the person's heartbeat.  Do you think we'll be seeing more robo-dresses? What do you think about the relationship between technology and fashion?

Whatever medium he's in — TV, Film, the stage — DeVito fully embraces it. He takes a similar approach to technology and social media, as he explained to Mashable in our interview with him on the floor of CES 2013. The 68-year-old actor sat down with us after an entertaining chat on the Panasonic stage at CES 2013. He was there to promote the Blu-ray release of his film Hoffa, in which he starred and directed. DeVito explained that the technology ""kicks ass"" because it gives filmmakers the opportunity to go back in and make the movie ""a little bit better."" An avid Twitter user (@DannyDeVito), DeVito has posted dozens of pictures of his bare foot in exotic and international locations. Each one is accompanied by the hashtag #TrollFoot, a reference to a live stage show from the ""It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" team. DeVito told us he loves how Twitter lets him connect with other people, gives voice to different views and can act as a force for social good. Yes, he writes his own tweets. While on stage, DeVito talked about shooting digitally and spending time editing his next movie in Final Cut. He's well aware of the benefits and pitfalls of the digitization of cinema, but when asked how he would combat movie piracy, DeVito suggested telling teens it's as dangerous for them as unprotected sex.  He told us his children encouraged him to get an iPhone and get on social media, but does not spend much time on Facebook. ""I have a page, but I don’t participate. Twitter is really easy."" When we asked DeVito what the Taxi cast would have done with Twitter if the social platform were around in the 1970s, he said he thought the late Andy Kaufman, who played Latka, would have loved it. He also uses Apple’s Siri intelligent assistant software, but added, ""Siri is a ball-breaker."" Check out the video above for the full interview.

In a post to its corporate blog on Thursday, Jake Levine, general manager of Digg, and Michael Young, CTO of Digg, unveiled the site's first ad product since its redesign, dubbed ""Apps We Like."" It's a little different than your typical display ad. Developers are encouraged to submit an application to have their mobile apps considered for inclusion. If Digg's team think it's an app their users should know about, developers will then be invited to pay a flat fee to have their apps featured, beginning at $5,000 for a single day, Levine tells me.  Apps accepted into the program will be marked as ""Sponsored,"" and appear on Digg's iPhone and iPad apps as well its homepage. Quoting John Borthwick, CEO of Digg's parent company Betaworks, Levine and Young said it's critical for Digg to develop a revenue strategy that ""align[s] to the grain of the product."" Thus, instead of ad space to the highest bidder, they're hoping to advertise products their users will like and are thus more likely to engage with. This particular ad unit itself is unlikely to be a major money-maker, but it does indicate the kinds of revenue-generating features we can expect to see from Digg going forward.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/earth-like-planet-confirm-exists/,How Will Scientists Confirm Earth-Like Planet Exists?,"The announcement this week that astronomers have found a potential alien world that could be the most Earth-like exoplanet yet is raising a big question: How will scientists confirm the existence of a true alien Earth? While NASA's planet-hunting Kepler space telescope, which discovered the newfound Earth-like planet candidate KOI 172.2, is great for finding large exoplanets beyond the reaches of our sun, it is not our best bet for recognizing an Earth-twin circling a distant star. In order to understand what an Earth-twin candidate really looks like, it takes a more refined approach than what Kepler can provide, at the moment. “It’s a statistical mission,” astronomer Natalie Batalha said of Kepler at the 221st meeting of the American Astronomical Society on Tuesday. The Kepler mission is designed to find out how many possible exoplanets there could be in any given part of the galaxy. The space telescope launched in 2009 and stares unblinking at a single patch of the sky to scan for dips in light from stars, a telltale sign of an orbiting planet passing in front of the star. Kepler's observations can tell scientists where a planet is in relation to its home star, but the spacecraft has little to add about the composition and climate of the exoplanet in its view, researchers said.  SEE ALSO: Most Earth-like Exoplanet Discovery Explained (Infographic) But how can scientists study those important questions that need to be answered before a planet can be deemed an Earth-twin?  The Kepler mission is a starting point in the search for a true Earth-like planet, Nicolas Cowen a post-doctoral fellow in astronomy at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. told SPACE.com. “Kepler just told us how big the telescope we have to build is.” There could be as many as 17 billion Earth-sized planets in the Milky Way galaxy alone, but that doesn’t mean they’re easy to research once detected. Once planets of interest, like super-Earths such as the newly discovered object of interest KOI 172.02, are confirmed by Kepler, then other instruments can be used to investigate the specifics of the planet. A ground-based telescope could be just the right tool for finding Earth’s twins, said Cowen. If the exoplanet in question is near enough to the Earth and in exactly the right position, researchers could aim a 33-foot dish toward the planet to optically observe its transit between the Earth and its home-star. After researchers have measured the radius of the planet and if a telescope can make direct observations of the planet in question, Cowen said, then it is just a matter of patience.
 
Cowen added that all it takes after a researcher knows the size and rotation of the planet is as much observation time as possible. Watching the way a planet rotates and taking measurements of the different colors that come in and out of view as the planet orbits its star gives researchers a sense of what might lie under the surface of the atmosphere. Water, land and clouds reflect light in different ways, and by directly observing those reflections, astronomers like Cowen can start to see how an exoplanet might be an Earth twin. “That’s what would happen in an ideal world,” Cowen said. Those days of “ideal” research might not be as far off as some believe. Cowen thinks that it could only be a matter of time before astronomers are able to peer into the atmosphere of an exoplanet and see what’s happening on the surface using a ground-based telescope. In a presentation earlier this week, astronomer Ian Crossfield suggested that it’s likely that an Earth-sized planet in the “habitable zone” of an M-dwarf star — a type of star smaller and dimmer than the sun, but plentiful in the Milky Way — will be found within 31 parsecs of Earth, a relatively short distance in astronomical terms. “This is the first meeting where any of these ideas have even brought up,” Cowen said. “It’s very exciting.” Images courtesy of NASA; F.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/faster-wifi/,Your Home Wi-Fi Is About to Get Faster,"Are all your family or roommates' laptops, phones, tablets, gaming consoles and other wireless devices clogging up the invisible pipes that make up your home Wi-Fi network? Good news: That network will soon be faster and support more bandwidth-intensive activity, including streaming high-definition video. Federal Communications Chairman Julius Genachowski announced during CES Wednesday that the FCC is planning its biggest expansion of wireless spectrum for Wi-Fi in a decade. Specifically, the FCC is opening up to 195 megahertz of unlicensed spectrum in the 5 gigahertz band for high-speed, high-capacity Wi-Fi known as ""Gigabit Wi-Fi.""  The move, which will begin next month, will free up unlicensed spectrum for Gigabit Wi-Fi by approximately 35%. Making that spectrum available, argues the FCC in its statement about the plan, will provide for ""higher data speeds and greater capacity.""  Translation: those with technology that can make use of Gigabit Wi-Fi are about to see faster speeds and more capability to have multiple devices pulling down lots of data on their personal networks. Homes aren't the only target of the FCC's upcoming Wi-Fi expansion: it also announced a ""government-wide effort"" to bolster speeds and lessen congestion at ""airports, convention centers and large conference gatherings"" — all locations where finding a decent Wi-Fi signal is often a headache.
 
""We all know the frustration of Wi-Fi congestion at conferences and airports,"" said Genachowski. ""Today, the FCC is moving to bring increased speed and capacity to Wi-Fi networks by increasing the amount of unlicensed spectrum for Wi-Fi. As this spectrum comes on line, we expect it to relieve congested Wi-Fi networks at major hubs like convention centers and airports.  It will also help in homes as tablets and smartphones proliferate and video use rises."" SEE ALSO: FCC OKs Television-to-Wireless Data Spectrum Auctions

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/fitbug/,Fitbug Launches New Suite of Health Trackers,"LAS VEGAS — You may not have heard of Fitbug before, but the wearable fitness tracking device maker was one of the first companies in the now booming fit-tech space.  Launched in 2005, the UK company moved to the U.S. in 2010. Fitbug originally sold its product to companies and healthcare providers but now it's reaching out to the consumer market.  At International CES 2013 Fitbug announced three new products — the Fitbug Orb (activity tracker), Fitbug Wow (scale), and Fitbug Luv (blood pressure monitor). All of the devices are Bluetooth 4.0 enabled so you can receive all the data on one app.  Your personal data is also uploaded to the Fitbug cloud and accessible on your personal account on the website. As with most of the Fitbug products, users must buy a monthly service plan to access the cloud and have an account on the site. Pricing ranges depending on which device and plan your purchase.  Paul Landau, CEO of Fitbug, tells Mashable Fitbug's products offer users personalized health programs by tracking their progress in terms of weight, activity and blood pressure.  With the launch of the new Fitbug Orb, Landau said they've listened to user feedback and heard people complain about wearing the device. Like most pedometers, Fitbug attaches onto your waistband or pants pocket. When wearing a dress, women had no option but it to tuck it into their underwear, which was uncomfortable, he said.  The newest Fitbug Orb offers lots of wearable options. It comes with a lanyard and a safety clip, so you won't lose it. Plus a sleep band (it tracks sleep, too) and a key fob. Consumers can chose the other new wearable accessories such as the wristband ($14.99), belt clip ($9.99), or thin magnetic underwear clip ($9.99).  The Fitbug Orb retails for $49.99 which includes access to the Fitbug cloud for one year. After that, the cost to access the Fitbug cloud is $3.99 per month.  SEE ALSO: 5 Lesser-Known Fitness Gadgets to Fuel Your Workout  The blood pressure monitor, the Fitbug Luv, is currently going through FDA approval. Landau said he is hoping it will be approved some time around May or June. (Most of these devices don't go through FDA approval, but when something specifically gives users a diagnosis, it needs FDA approval). It will compete with the Withings blood pressure monitoring device that's already available. The Luv costs $119.99.
 
The Fitbug scale (the Wow) costs $79.99, or $119.99 if purchased bundled with the Fitbug Air. The Fitbug Air Bluetooth 4 wireless activity tracker was released this past fall. The Air ranges in cost from $29.99 for the device plus three months access to the Fitbug cloud, or can be purchased with 12 months of cloud access for $59.99. After the 12 months, the cost to access the Fitbug cloud is $3.99 per month. Fitbug is currently working on integrating with MyFitnessPal and LoseIt.com. It is already integrated with MapMyFitness.

Employees who eat healthy all day long were 25% more likely to have higher job performance, the study found, while those who eat five or more servings of fruit and vegetables at least four times a week were 20% more likely to be more productive. In addition, employees who exercise for at least 30 minutes, three times a week, were 15% more likely to have higher job performance. Overall, absenteeism was 27% lower for those workers who ate healthy and regularly exercised and that their job performance was 11% higher than their peers who were obese, the study found. Overweight workers experienced lower job performance and higher absenteeism, compared to those employees who suffer from depression and other chronic diseases or conditions. ""This latest study investigating the link between employee health, performance and productivity reinforces the business case for employers to provide comprehensive, evidence-based health management programs for their work force,"" said Jerry Noyce, president and CEO of HERO. Carter Coberley, vice president of Health Research and Outcomes at Healthways, said more and more employers are defining individual well-being through the performance and productivity of their work force. ""Well-being is gaining recognition as an important measure that relates both to the quality of life of individuals as well as to financial measures that are important to business and government leaders,"" Coberley said. ""Well-being can also serve as an important business success metric through its demonstrated relationship to employee absence and job performance as measured in multiple large employers,"" he added. The study was based on data from three geographically dispersed U.S. companies, representing 20,114 employees who completed a work-related survey each year from 2008 through 2010. It was published in this month's Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine. Photo courtesy of Flickr, Marshall Astor - Food Fetishist

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/gmail-wish-list/,9 Things We Wish Gmail Could Do,"Have you ever emailed back and forth with someone and she keeps sending you a separate email with each new thought? Or maybe the emails you receive from someone using a different email service get pushed into separate threads in your Gmail inbox. Whatever the reason, separate emails that belong in the same thread are a pain. It would be great to have a feature that merged separate emails into the same thread, at least for organizational purposes. For some reason, it's incredibly difficult to highlight and copy conversations in Gchat, especially if you don't have a mouse with a scroll wheel. If your chat extends past the small window and you try to drag and highlight, the text is deselected. You also can't use the ""Select All"" keyboard shortcut since you can't actually place the cursor within already-sent chats. This could be incredibly useful if you're chatting with someone and you want to ping him or her a file, without having to send a separate email. Mashable composite image: Clipart courtesy of OpenClipArt.org, jabon. ""Out of office"" messages are extremely convenient. They're the modern-day versions of answering machine announcements.  Gmail currently lets you set up an ""out of office"" message for everyone who emails you. You can also filter the auto-response to only your contacts, or if you're using your company's Gmail service, only to co-workers. Odds are, though, that the people who really need to see your ""out of office"" message are those outside your contacts. Gmail should give you the option to push the auto-response only to that group. You have the option to go ""Invisible"" in Gchat, meaning your name doesn't show up in anyone's chat list. If you use Gchat for both work and personal, however, it would be useful to select whom you appear visible to; it's also helpful to discourage that one pesky co-worker who won't leave you alone. You can set up a system that sort of mirrors folders within Gmail by using labels and the ""Archive"" tool. But it can get messy, and your list of labels can get long and cumbersome.  Since folders work so well in Drive, it makes sense to bring that feature to Gmail. That way, you can easily organize and find emails without using the convoluted label ""nesting"" function. Mashable composite image: Clipart courtesy of OpenClipArt.org, jhnri4. When ""replying all"" to emails, the addresses in the To: and CC: fields often reverse. A button that could switch them in the correct order may seem unnecessary, especially since Gmail now lets you drag and drop email addresses, but this could prove useful for the super quick (and/or lazy) emailer. When you include someone on an email through BCC, you ensure that his or her email address is not visible to the rest of the people on the thread. However, let's say three people are CC'd for the main conversation, and 10 are BCC'd. If there were an ""Enduring BCC"" function, the people BCC'd could follow the entire conversation. This could get dicey if used poorly, but could be incredibly efficient for the right purposes. If you're ever in a situation where you need to forward several emails to the same person, a mass forward option could come in handy. Think of general business email addresses where people send inquiries to various members of the staff, or if you're trying to transfer emails from your main account to an alternate account -- this feature could eliminate a lot of tedious work. Gmail is one of the most popular and efficient email services out there. Launched in invite-only beta in 2004, Google's webmail service has greatly evolved over the past nine years with new designs, labs, apps and more.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/google-europe-search/,Europe Will Likely Force Google to Change Search Practices,"Google may have gotten off with a slap on the wrist in the United States for its search practices, but it doesn't look like it will get off so easily in Europe. Joaquín Almunia, the European Union's competition chief, told the Financial Times Thursday he believes European regulators will demand Google change the way its own products are displayed in search or else face hefty fines for ""diverting traffic"" away from competitors' products. ""We are still investigating, but my conviction is [Google] are diverting traffic,"" Almunia told the Financial Times. European regulators have been investigating for two years whether Google is taking advantage of its dominant position in online search to drive traffic to its other products, such as Google Maps or Google Flight Search.  ""They are monetising this kind of business, the strong position they have in the general search market and this is not only a dominant position, I think –- I fear -– there is an abuse of this dominant position,"" added Almunia.  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission was conducting a similar investigation but ultimately decided Google's search behavior was legal, it announced last week. Google did, however, agree to change its patent licensing procedures and allow websites to opt-out of having their content scraped without hurting their Search Engine Optimization. Europe is also conducting investigations of those subjects. Almunia told the Financial Times that Europe's decision regarding Google's practices of patent licensing and content scraping would ""not be weaker"" than that given by the FTC. SEE ALSO: Google Settles FTC Antitrust Case, Makes Minor Changes to Search and Ads
 Google, which on Dec. 18 was given a one-month ultimatum to come up with a solution to end the investigation by regulators, handles over 90% of search traffic in Europe. An announcement of the investigation's results is expected in the near future. Photo courtesy of iStockphoto, gmutlu "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/hbo-girls-social/,HBO's 'Girls' Are Basically Your Friends ... on Facebook,"HBO's Girls has achieved what every TV show dreams of: A network of connected fans who love to share their opinions about the show, compare themselves to the lead characters — Are you a Hannah, Marnie, Jessa or Shoshana? — and tweet with the show's signature hashtag introduced before the season one premiere #mistakesGIRLSmake. The HBO dramedy about four young friends figuring out life in New York City, now entering its second season, instantly drew comparisons to Sex and the City, its HBO Sunday night predecessor by more than a decade. Comparing and contrasting the two shows is fruit for many lively discussions (be they in high school cafeterias, sorority dining rooms or at happy hour counters). But something major has changed since (the first time) Carrie Bradshaw graced the cable airwaves. Girls fans of today have a different bond with the show's characters than SATC fans could have imagined. They connect with the shows characters on their mobile phones while waiting for the bus and in their Twitter feeds while distracted at work.  HBO's marketing team has used social media to transform the show's four leading ladies from characters you watch for 30-minutes on TV (or perhaps, on your laptop using your parents' HBO Go account) to friends you see in your Instagram feed that make you giggle as you ""double tap"" your love.  While you could argue the entrance of all TV shows into the social networking space has changed the relationship of viewers and characters, HBO's VP of Social Media and Marketing Sabrina Caluori explains that Girls fans' own behavior has driven the show's marketing. The over-sharing phenomenon is a marketing team's bread and butter. Caluori told Mashable, ""We're totally inspired by the fan behavior."" When we look at all the different social platforms that are out there, we look at what the fans are doing naturally. The GIF behavior on Tumblr was there long before we ever were, and in a way that felt really germane to that platform.""  That GIF behavior ultimately fueled the creation of the ""What Should We Call Girls"" Tumblr blog, officially launched by HBO in December. The blog aggregates animated GIFs combining scenes and memorable quotations from the show. While HBO curates the blog, the GIFs are fan generated.  The energy of fans has kept the show's accounts active in the seven months since the season one finale. ""When we start work on a show we discuss whether it has a fan base that will stay engaged year round without trying to forcefeed people to sustain it,"" Caluori says. ""With Girls, in addition to content around the show, it's such a lifestyle in and of itself. The community is about more than just the show, it's the music, the fashion, New York, the locations. Even though there was a finite number of episodes, you feel Girls all around you all the time.""  Beyond the non-seasonal nature of its social accounts, HBO has made the Girls characters staples of its fans social media lives by integrating fans' own lives into its feeds. HBO will call for and subsequently share fans' resolutions and mistakes, using both the original #mistakesGIRLSmake and season two's #resolutionsGIRLSbreak. Likewise, HBO will call for favorite mistakes, quotations and hypothetical resolutions from the shows' characters. The hypothetical resolutions have also been at the heart of the show's paid marketing campaigns. For the season two premiere Sunday, HBO won't be promoting hashtags on Twitter, but will be using the hashtag #resolutionsGIRLSbreak, which it's used throughout season two promotion, and the hashtag #GIRLSathon during the season one marathon, playing on HBO starting at 4 p.m. Sunday. (During the season one premiere, HBO promoted three different hashtags, #GIRLSnight, #mistakesGIRLSmake and #GIRLSonHBO.)  ""Girls is a younger skewing show for HBO, and its fans are more adept at creating user-generated content,"" Caluori says. ""It's a beautiful thing about working on Girls: When you have a creator that understands social media in the way Lena [Dunham] does, and she's encouraged us from day one, and really trusted us."" Though Girls has consistently produced social content during the off-season, it has a few new things in store for the season two premiere. On Thursday, HBO launched its first Pinterest account, for Girls, curated by the show's costume designer Jenn Rogein.  The show is also expanding its GetGlue presence, with custom badges for each episode, inspired by the ""All Adventurous Women Do"" cross-stitch in Hannah's apartment. Each week a new digital cross-stitch of a quote from that episode will be released, and one fan will be chosen at random to win a real, framed cross-stitch from Etsy artist Katie Kutthroat.  Girls has given away some fan-appropriate giveaways to its loyal social media followers leading up to the premiere, including blowouts from Drybar, spin classes at SoulCycle, and a year's rent and an apartment makeover from Urban Outfitters.  Has Girls' social marketing changed the way you relate to its characters? Let us know in the comments if your appreciate the immersive experience.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/how-curiosity-rover-works/,How the Mars Curiosity Rover Works,"On a hopeful evening in August 2012, a roomful of NASA employees held their breath as they watched a rover named Curiosity attempt a landing that was no short of a miracle. After what they dubbed the ""seven minutes of terror,"" the control room erupted with emotion as Curiosity's wheels safely touched the surface of Mars. Curiosity rover will drive around the Gale Crater in a mission to determine if Mars could ever support microbial life. This information will serve as the foundation for possible manned missions to the Red Planet.  Curiosity — who has assumed a female personality on NASA's social networks — is different from the any other rover to ever land on Mars. For starters, Curiosity is 10 feet long, 7 feet tall and five times heavier than her predecessors Spirit and Opportunity, twin rovers that NASA launched in 2003. To put it in more tangible terms, Curiosity is about the same size as a car at 1,928 pounds. No space is wasted on the $2.5 billion Curiosity rover. She is packed with a cutting-edge scientific payload that allows her to explore Mars like a human would. Here is a rundown of just some of the hardware that the rover uses on the mysterious Red Planet.  If you've kept up with the latest news about Curiosity's findings, you have probably seen the incredible, high-res images she has beamed from the Red Planet. The rover uses 17 different types of cameras to snap these images — in both black and white and color — and high-definition video.  The first camera the rover used was her Mars Decent Imager (MARDI), which was turned on as she completed her white-knuckle descent onto the Red Planet. The 2-megapixel wide-angle camera recorded a full-color, HD video of that landing so that we can relive those seven minutes whenever we want. Next up on the rover is the Mars Hand Lens Imager, which captures extremely close-up images of things like soil, rocks and ice. Mounted on Curiosity's arm, this camera is so advanced that it can reveal details of materials that are smaller than the width of a human hair. Curiosity has also used this camera to snap incredible self portraits.  Built at about human-eye level, Curiosity's Mars Science Laboratory Mast Camera takes color photos and video of the rover's surroundings. Essentially, this camera sees what she ""sees"" — the Red Planet terrain or materials collected with the rover's arm, for example. This camera can take incredible 360-degree panoramic views of Mars by stitching together images slowly taken in a rotating circle.  Curiosity's suite of instruments, called Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM), analyzes material the rover collects using her arm. All of these tools are used to complete her ultimate mission of assessing carbon-based molecules — the building blocks of life — on the alien planet. For this instrument, Curiosity will deliver powdered samples to one of two funnels on her ""back"" and then to small cups for processing inside the rover's ""body."" The entire box is about the size of a microwave oven and weighs about 88 pounds. For studying Mars' atmosphere, Curiosity has a gas chromatograph, a mass spectrometer and a tunable laser spectrometer with combined capabilities to identify a wide range of organic compounds and determine the ratios of different isotopes of key elements. To identify materials in rocks and soils, Curiosity uses an on-board an X-ray diffraction and fluorescence instrument called CheMin.  The rover uses an instrument named ChemCam to vaporize thin layers of material from Martian rocks or soil targets up to 23 feet away. It took eight years for the U.S. Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory and France's national space and research agencies to build the ChemCam. And Curiosity didn't waste anytime before firing it. Using 30 pulses of laser for 10 seconds, Curiosity blasted her first fist-sized rock called ""Coronation"" in August.   The rover first used SAM in early November. NASA released the initial results of those findings at the first of December. Despite a rumor that turned out to be a major misunderstanding, those first soil samples did not contain an ""earth-shaking"" discovery. However, the data did show that Martian soil is a complex makeup of water, sulfur and chlorine-containing substances.  So Curiosity has all this fancy equipment, but how does she know what to use and when to use it? NASA released this handy 60-second video showing how the control center here on Earth sends commands to a rover that's about 140 million miles away.  To complete drives or tasks, NASA engineers send computer commands to the six-wheeled Curiosity the night before she is set to complete them. When it comes to driving, engineers have two options: specific commands (like ""drive forward 10 feet"") or they can write commands that allow the rover think on her own (such as ""see that rock over there? Drive toward it."").  For the latter situation, the rover uses her hazcams — she has four pairs of these cameras — to get a 3D view of hazardous obstacles to avoid while driving. These cameras also help engineers plan where Curiosity will scoop up her next soil sample.  Just five months into her mission on Mars, the Curiosity rover has already made history. In September, her photos revealed an ancient streambed on Mars where water once flowed several billions of years ago. Curiosity Chief Scientist John Grotzinger noted that ""a long-flowing stream can be a habitable environment."" In November, NASA scientists analyzed the rover's initial radiation measurements and found that levels at the Martian surface appear to be similar to those astronauts experience in low-Earth orbit. That means that astronauts would be able to survive this environment, putting us one step closer to putting a human on Mars. The Curiosity mission has been such a success so far that NASA is now planning another robotic science rover that will launch in 2020. Mars Science Laboratory will use the same framework as Curiosity for the next rover's development and design.  ""Curiosity's mission is producing an unprecedented volume of valuable science data,"" Grotzinger told Mashable in November. ""Much of this will help us better glimpse the very ancient environments of Mars, that are regarded to have been the most habitable in the planet's history. We have only just started on this journey back in time."" Photo courtesy of NASA/JPL "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/how-to-ace-job-interview/,How to Knock Your Next Interview Out of the Park,"Give your interviewer a firm handshake. Make eye contact. Answer each question succinctly. Have questions to ask the interviewer at the end. You probably already know the interview essentials. But if you want to move from being a viable candidate to the hiring manager’s top choice, you’ll need to go well beyond the basics.  While the way you dress and present yourself is important, it will be the substance of your responses and interactions that leave the interviewer picturing you in the role — and, more importantly, being unable to imagine that anyone else could be a better fit. Convey these four messages in your next interview, and you’re sure to hit a home run. Hiring managers want to hire people who have a history of getting things done. The logic goes that if you were successful in other jobs, then you’re likely to be successful in this one. Truly, nothing says ""hire me"" better than a track record of achieving amazing results in past jobs. So, your first task in the interview is to describe how indispensable you were in your previous position. You can’t just say, ""I was the best Junior Analyst they’d ever seen, and the place will never be the same now that I’m gone"" — you have to show the interviewer by providing specific examples of the actions you took and what results came because of them. These are two of the four components of the S-T-A-R method for responding to interview questions. To use this method, set up the situation and the task that you were required to complete to provide the interviewer with background context (e.g., ""In my last job as a Junior Analyst, it was my role to manage the invoicing process""), but spend the bulk of your time describing what you actually did (the action) and what you achieved (the result).  For example, ""In one month, I streamlined the process, which saved my group 10 man-hours each month and reduced errors on invoices by 5%."" Don’t worry that someone else could have done it if they were in your position — they weren’t. It was your job, your actions, your results. Unfortunately, success in one role does not necessarily translate to being a fit in another role — and to convince the interviewer that you’ll be able to hit the ground running and be awesome in the new job, you must explain how your skills translate. In particular, you want to highlight those skills that specifically address the issues that the hiring manager is facing. To understand those issues, conduct industry research prior to the interview. Are there certain themes that come up again and again in job descriptions in your field, like being a shark at sales or a detail-oriented perfectionist? Also listen closely to what the interviewer is asking — often, she'll ask leading questions or share challenges that others before you have had in the role. For example, say the interviewer asks, ""We have tight deadlines and have to turn around our projects quickly. Can you work under time pressure?"" Don’t just say yes — give a response that showcases your skills and how they’d transfer, like: ""Absolutely. In my last job, we often had short deadlines. I was great at managing these situations because I focused on consistent communication with the team, and used my organization skills to stay on top of everything we had going on."" Then, provide a specific example. Companies have interview guidelines designed to hire the most qualified employees based on experience and aptitude, but let’s be honest: Often a big factor is likability. Hiring managers don’t generally hire people that they don’t connect or vibe with. Of course, they don’t often say that — they cloak it in statements like, ""She’s smart, but I just don’t think that she is the right fit for the role."" But the truth is, you won’t get hired if you’re not liked. So to get the job, you must connect with the interviewer. We're not suggesting that you crack jokes or become buddies — but you should be confident and interact as if you’re already working together, through eye contact, active listening, smiling and avoiding nervous laughter. Call it ""relaxed formality."" It’s an interview, so don’t get too comfortable, but try to be yourself and have a natural conversation. You’re almost there! But, it’s not enough that you’re capable of doing the job and would be pleasant to work with — you have to actually want the job. Hiring managers, after all, are looking for employees that really want to be there and will be part of the team for the long haul. So, you want to show enthusiasm for the role. Not bouncy cheerleader ""spirit,"" but the type of enthusiasm that comes from understanding what the role entails, how you can add value in the role based on your previous experiences and what new challenges it offers to you for growth and development.  Think, ""One of the reasons I’m so excited about this role is because it allows me to leverage my client management skills [your expertise] with larger clients on more complex deals [the new challenge]."" And, of course, you’ll want to follow up with a genuine, seal-the-deal thank-you note. Photo courtesy of Flickr, BAKOKO

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/ibm-watson-urban-dictionary/,"IBM's Watson Memorized Entire Urban Dictionary, Then His Overlords Deleted It","Humans talk funny. We invent words. We smash words together, tear them apart, abbreviate them one way, then another. Which is great and fun, if you're a human. Not so great if you are a machine or the kind of human who programs machines to understand language. When IBM's famous artificial intelligence, Watson, he/she/it of Jeopardy-winning fame, was in development, its head researcher had a great idea. Humans created this repository of slang, The Urban Dictionary. For example, today on the site, we learn that 'healthy gas' is ""the gas (fart) produced from a person who has eaten healthy foods like cabbage, beans, broccolli, grains or other high fiber, high carbohydrate foods."" Brown realized that this formalization of informal language might be a great way for Watson to understand the way real people communicate. So, he and his team, fed the whole thing into their AI. But one problem. Informal language has a tendency to be dirty, nasty language. Its insults and cuss words, new names for gross old things, old names for gross new things, etc. And so, we learn from Fortune's Michal Lev-Ram, they had to delete all that human messiness from Watson's memory. Watson couldn't distinguish between polite language and profanity — which the Urban Dictionary is full of. Watson picked up some bad habits from reading Wikipedia as well. In tests it even used the word ""bullshit"" in an answer to a researcher's query. Ultimately, Brown's 35-person team developed a filter to keep Watson from swearing and scraped the Urban Dictionary from its memory. Image courtesy of Jeopardy/Alexis C. Madrigal

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/kaley-cuoco-priceline/,Kaley Cuoco Revealed as William Shatner's Daughter in Priceline Ad," The daughter of Priceline's Negotiator, a.k.a. William Shatner, is none other than Big Bang Theory's Kaley Cuoco. Who knew? In the ad above, Cuoco is given over, Kill Bill-style, to a martial artist master to learn the craft of negotiating. But things changed a lot over the 20 years Cuoco spent in the monastery. Now you can use Priceline on your smartphone and ""you don't even have to bid."" Perhaps the real surprise here is that Shatner, who was supposed to retire from Priceline ads last year and appeared to be killed off in ad, is back. Rather than coming back from the dead, though, this seems to be a flashback of sorts. However, a press release from Priceline makes it clear that Shatner will be starring in more ads, so this isn't a changing of the guard as much as the introduction of a new character.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/kickstart-films-oscars-nominations/,3 Kickstarter-Backed Films Earn Oscar Nods,"Sprinkled among the high-budget films nominated for Oscars this year are three with humble financial beginnings.  Inocente, Kings Point and Buzkashi Boys got monetary boosts from crowdfunding platform Kickstarter long before the Academy granted them nods at Thursday's nominations event.  The flicks raised more than $90,000 from 558 backers on Kickstarter. Those projects' creators are just a few of the filmmakers who have raked in $102.7 million in pledges since 2009.  ""These are the fourth, fifth and sixth Kickstarter projects to be nominated for Oscars,"" said Kickstarter in a statement. ""Incident in New Baghdad, Sun Come Up, and The Barber of Birmingham were all nominated in the past."" SEE ALSO: Filmmakers Have Earned $102.7 Million in Pledges on Kickstarter
 Inocente and Kings Point earned nominations in Best Documentary (Short Subject), while Buzkashi Boys got a nod in Short Film (Live Action). No Kickstarter project has won an Oscar, but the Kickstarter folks have their ""fingers crossed"" that one will win this year. Winners of the 85th Academy Awards will be revealed Feb. 24. The nearly $103 million figure above comes from 891,979 people, who helped fund one of 8,567 independent films, features, documentaries, shorts, web series or other video projects.    Goal:$100,000
Pledged:$1,192,793 Singer/songwriter Amanda Palmer spent four years writing a record and putting her band together. Formerly part of the Dresden Dolls duo, Palmer broke away from a major record label to do her own thing.  The album, supported by Kickstarter, was the first million-dollar music project on the platform. It debuted in the top 10 of the Billboard Charts a few months later. Image courtesy of Shervin Lainez Goal: $35,000
Pledged: $106,330 ArduSat is a tiny satellite that weighs no more than 1kg, but it has made a huge impact on the future of space research. Created by NanoSatisfi, this Kickstarter project went well beyond its $35,000 goal in just one month. The project has democratized space exploration, making it feasible for anyone to run his own space experiment, depending on how many pledges he gets.   Image courtesy of NanoSatisfi Goal: $20,000
Pledged: $20,033 Brooklyn Castle is a documentary about after-school programs' effects on kids, teachers and schools. Production company Rescue Media relied on Kickstarter since the beginning of its creative inception in 2010, then again in 2011, when it was finishing the film.  The award-winning film was already going to theaters in 2012, but the budget did not ensure the film would reach the very community it was intended for. Naturally, the team asked Kickstarter and the community came through once again. The film went on to show in 200 theaters across the country, and viewers who needed transportation to the screening were accommodated. Image courtesy of Brooklyn Castle Goal: $400,000
Pledged : $3,336,371 This was a particularly groundbreaking year for gamers on Kickstarter. One of the most important projects, Double Fine Adventure became the first multi-million dollar video game campaign. The game reached its $400,000 goal in less than 24 hours, making it one of the fastest-funded projects on Kickstarter. Gamers suddenly realized their ideas were viable, and more campaigns like the ones for OUYA and Shadowrun Returns had the opportunity to shine. Image courtesy of Double Fine
 Goal: $100,000
Pledged : $10,266,845 An iPhone-friendly wristwatch, another seemingly simple concept, nonetheless blew up overnight. The makers at Pebble Technology had a modest $100,000 goal, but reached $1 million in a little more than a day. Image courtesy of Pebble Technology Goal: $100,000
Pledged : $155,186 What do New Yorkers want from an old, abandoned trolley terminal in the Lower East Side? Not more public transportation, but the world's first underground park.  LowLine, a project by Delancey Underground, will use solar technology for natural illumination. The 1.5-acre space is located on the Lower East Side, and has been out of operation since 1948. Image courtesy of Delancey Underground
 Goal: $10,000
Pledged : $11,249 3D printing is no longer just for architects and prototypes. Design duo Mary Huang and Jenna Fizel, co-founders of Continuum Fashion, want to help fashion lovers create custom garments by using an app. Every design is uniquely made to order. Continuum used Kickstarter to host a private beta. Any pledge amount gave users priority access to the service.  Image courtesy of Continuum Fashion
 Goal: $15,000
Pledged : $16,262 In 2009, when Daniel Mustard was homeless, his cover of Radiohead's ""Creep"" went viral on YouTube. Mustard told Mashable the exposure gave him back his will to live. Mustard lauched a Kickstarter project in July to pay for the cost of producing and distributing an EP. Most of the songs were inspired by his tribulations. The musician is no longer homeless, having found temporary access at shelters and using the Internet to mingle with fans at Apple stores. Image courtesy of Daniel Mustard
 Goal: $75,000
Pledged: $1,464,706 The Elevation Dock was a simple concept with one main mission: to make docking an iPhone as seamless as possible, especially when the device is in a case.  This was obviously a common problem among iPhone users. Designer Casey Hopkins and ElevationLab were the first million-dollar project on Kickstarter. And the dock set the bar for high-quality craftsmanship.  Image courtesy of ElevationLab Goal: $250,000
Pledged : $528,144 Online advertising has changed drastically from late '90s standards. Penny Arcade, one of the most popular gaming webcomics currently online, realized that web banners were no longer cutting it. The site used Kickstarter to replace ad revenue with crowdfunding. The leaderboard on the homepage would be removed if they reached the minimum goal of $250,000, expanding to even more ad removal throughout the site as it surpassed higher goals.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/laptop-vending-machine/,Laptop Vending Machine Offers Safety for Students,"A laptop bag might protect your computer from the elements but it could also act as a bullseye for muggers.  For students on late-night studying binges, schlepping their tech around campus might not be ideal. Drexel University in Philadelphia has an interesting solution to that problem. The university installed a MacBook vending machine in the library, reports VentureBeat. The machine dispenses out laptops on loan 24 hours a day. This way, students can access technology easily, and not worry about staying too late at the library and then having to carrying their laptops home.    SEE ALSO: What to Do if Your Cellphone or Laptop Gets Lost or Stolen  To access the vending machine, students will need to use their university ID cards. Students can borrow the laptops for five hours at a time, and a late fee of $5 will be incurred if the student doesn't bring it back in time. The vending machine itself holds 12 MacBooks. While the laptops rest inside the machine, they are charged and their hard drives wiped clean.  Drexel University released a statement about the new machine on Wednesday.  “Libraries are not only meant to house books,” Dean of Drexel University Libraries Dr. Danuta A. Nitecki, said in a statement. ""This was a great opportunity to match a specific student need with library staff's ongoing exploration of cutting edge technologies. We expect the resulting initiative to improve the Drexel student’s academic experience,"" Nitecki said We've seen MacBook and iPad vending machines before. Some offer gadgets and computers on loan while others sell them. Macys sells Apple products through a vending machine in select stores across the country.  While many university libraries offer laptop rentals, they usually are handled by staff. One benefit of using the vending machine is that no one needs to be working to loan a student a laptop.  Do you think vending machines that loan out tablets and computers should be in libraries across America? Tell us in the comments.  Photo courtesy of iStockphoto, vm and Drexel's Flickr account "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/lights-wemo-light-switch/,Control Your Lights From Anywhere With WeMo Light Switch,"LAS VEGAS — It seems iPhone owners aren't the only ones who forget to turn off light switches now and then.  WeMo announced the launch of a new product that now gives Android smartphone owners the ability to turn off their lights when they're gone — or just too relaxed to get up from a chair, like their iOS-using counterparts.  The Wi-Fi Light Switch (which is different than WeMo's product for iOS, called Switch) will let you Android-users control an entire bank of lights from the app. The WeMo Light Switch was demoed to Mashable at International CES 2013 in Las Vegas.   SEE ALSO: 8 Hot Gadgets for Your High-Tech Home  It works a lot like the WeMo Switch, but you install it like you would any light switch. You don't have to be home or logged into the same Wi-Fi network to make it work. And you can put as many Light Switches as you'd like in your house and all of them will connect to the app.  You can use WeMo's existing app for iOS devices or the upcoming Android app. The Android 4.0 app will launch in open public beta in February, with a final release in the summer. The WeMo Light Switch is expected to be available summer 2013.  The WeMo Light Switch will retail for $49.99.  What do you think about the Wemo Light Switch? Tell us in the comments.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/mayan-apocalypse-fansites/,Visit the Ruins of Mayan Apocalypse Fansites,"Now that we're more than a week into 2013, it feels safe to say the world did not end in December 2012. Planet Earth and human civilization aren't the only things that stubbornly refused to end last month. So did lots of apocalypse websites and forums. Some of the survivors are clearly forums maintained by people still hoping to peddle their unsold copies of various ""2012 OMG"" products, while others appear to be from true believers so sincere you almost feel bad for them, ready to pick up the shattered pieces of a world that steadfastly refused to shatter. How rude. The website Survive2012: Ancient Mayan Doomsday, Pole Shifts and Evolution exists mainly to sell copies of a book called Survive 2012, so it's no surprise that author and website owner Robert Best urges his readers to ""give it another 6 months (at least).""  Apparently, he's also behind the still-popular 2012forum.com, which announced last November that the forum would shut down sometime between January and June 2013.  The Maya Calendar and 2012 forum is also still up, though as of press time, most of the threads had not had new comments for several weeks. The most recent comment was to a thread started on Dec. 20, the night before the non-apocalypse, by a gloater posting under the name ""ToldYouSo."" Still, one determined 2012 believer responded, cheerfully suggesting that even if the end hasn't happened yet, it's bound to sooner or later: I believe that a crisis is what we have to have to bring about SUDDEN CHANGE and I think we will have one sooner rather than later.
 The true believer behind 2012apocalypse.net apparently combines Mayan apocalypse stories with unique interpretations of Biblical prophecies and the works of Nostradamus, plus something about the Antichrist and terrorists with nukes. We can't pin it down more closely than that.  In addition to Mayan-exclusive forums, there were also post-apocalyptic threads on regular conspiracy sites. One gloating poster at AboveTopSecret.com started a thread asking ""A question for 2012ers: will you admit you were wrong?"" The answer appears to be no.  Photo courtesy of Flickr, Kim-bodia

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/microsoft-surface-pro-hands-on/,Hands On With the Microsoft Surface Pro,"Starting at $899, the Surface Pro is the ""prosumer"" version of Microsoft's tablet. It runs Windows 8 Pro off an Intel Core i5 ship and is slightly thicker and noticeably heavier than the Surface RT. It will run older Windows apps as well as ones for Windows 8. The Surface Pro comes packed with a stylus for precise work. It functions very similarly to the Samsung Galaxy Note (or Note II). the back of the Surface Pro has a slight gap to accommodate air flow from the two cooling fans on board. LAS VEGAS — Looking back, it was a little odd that Microsoft chose the Surface RT tablet as its showcase for Windows 8. After all, the device was created to run a version of Windows that runs on ARM-based processors instead of the usual x86 chips that had powered all Windows machines before it. That inherently limited the Surface RT by preventing it from running legacy Windows apps. Windows 8 had to stand on its own, without the safety net of the classic desktop environment (it still exists on the device, it just can't run much of anything). That could be why the new operating system has apparently struggled to catch on. That might change with the Surface Pro (starting at $899). This, of course, is the version of the tablet that packs an Intel Core i5 processor instead of the ARM-based Tegra 3. Thanks to that CPU, the Surface Pro can run apps designed for Windows 7 or even older versions of Windows. Photoshop, iTunes, you name it — you can do it on this machine. Why would you want to, instead of, say, an Ultrabook or even a desktop PC? That's a question Microsoft has yet to answer adequately, although the Surface Pro makes a decent case. Microsoft was kind enough to let me check out one of the beefed-up Surfaces here in Vegas. No official release date yet, though the Microsoft has said the Pro will come about three months after the debut of the Surface RT. That would peg its release for late January. Should you be thinking about getting one? Absolutely — as long as you looooove Windows 8. I spent about 45 minutes with Microsoft executives checking out the new Surface, and it's telling that we spent maybe one or two of those in the legacy desktop environment. For all its strengths as a traditional PC, the Surface Pro is at its core a tablet, and Windows 8 is all about tablets. At first glance, the Surface Pro looks almost exactly like the Surface RT. It's the same screen size, the same angles — the same keyboard Touch Cover options. They could have called it the Surface Ditto. But looking at the edge of the device, you start to notice the differences. The Pro is slightly thicker and noticeably heavier. It's got about half a pound on the Surface RT, which actually feels quite heavy when you compare to recent tablets such as the comparably sized Samsung Galaxy Note, or even the 800-pound tablet in the room, the iPad. One of the first things you notice is the seam that seemingly separates the backside from the edges. It looks a little like the final piece of the tablet wasn't put on properly, but it's really how the tablet cools itself. As a Core-based device, the Surface Pro needs a cooling fan (it has two, actually), and Microsoft wanted heat to expel from the edge, letting you rest it in your lap as long as possible. That's still kind of a challenge since the Surface Pro, like the Surface RT, isn't a laptop per se, although it plays one on TV. You need to extend a kickstand to get it to rest anywhere, which I better on tabletops than shins (although I have a colleague who swears that propping the Surface on his knees isn't so bad). Once you turn it on, the most appreciable upgrade from the original Surface is the screen: The Surface Pro ups the resolution from 1,366 x 768 to full HD (1,920 x 1,080). The screen looks fantastic, and you can really appreciate the detail in both visual media and simple aspects of the UI, like the colored background. As beautiful as the Surface Pro's screen is, it's a little ironic that just yesterday Panasonic unveiled a 4K Windows 8 tablet. And there have been plenty of full HD Windows 8 laptops and hybrids. The Surface is really just catching up here. The Surface Pro includes an interesting extra: a stylus. Including the accessory makes some sense — you'll probably be in need of pen-like precision on this device much more often than on the Surface RT. Photoshop alone, for example, often needs you to stay on target. In my time with the Surface Pro, I got a chance to use the stylus with Fresh Paint, a drawing app. Although the stylus isn't powered, it — and the Surface Pro's software — were tailored specifically to work with each other. The pen is useless on the Surface RT (or any other tablet). If that sounds similar to the Samsung Galaxy Note, it is — in more ways than one. Microsoft even has its own version of ""Air View,"" where the screen can detect the stylus hovering above it. Once it does, it knows to ignore any errant pen strokes on the screen that could have been caused by errant fingers. There's even a button on the stylus — Microsoft is really aping Samsung here. At least it's good aping, and drawing with the pen is a pleasure. Doodling a face in Fresh Paint, I felt the screen had just the right amount of friction on the pen as I drew facial features. The stylus is pressure sensitive, too. While the Surface RT was a tablet that brought to the tablet some PC features, Microsoft sees the Surface Pro more as a PC with some tablet features. That makes some sense, given that the Surface Pro is Core-based — Microsoft even bypassed Intel's Atom chips to build the full PC experience into this machine. That machine may be heavy and have limited battery life, but that won't matter so much to the ""prosumer"" Windows crowd that Microsoft is courting here. Chances are, if you're opting for a Surface Pro, most of the time it's going to rest on your desk, jacked into another monitor and attached to either its Touch Cover or your own keyboard and mouse accessories. That's because the Surface Pro will be your main PC. It's everything the Surface RT was, plus the productivity part of the equation that was missing. The question is: If you want that productivity, are you prepared to go all in on mobility — Windows 8's version of mobility — even at the cost of things like a built in keyboard? Based on what I saw today, the Surface Pro is ready to take you to that future, where the gateway to your digital life is a slab of metal and glass that accompanies you almost everywhere, even though it'll spend most of its time nestled in a web of accessories.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/nasa-asteroid-apophis-2036/,NASA: Asteroid Apophis Will Not Hit Earth in 2036,"After collecting data from Asteroid Apophis' distant Earth flyby yesterday, NASA confirms that the asteroid will not collide with the Earth in 2036. The Slooh Space Camera caught a glimpse of the much-talked-about Apophis on Jan. 9 as it passed 9 million miles away from Earth. While the asteroid's size isn't that large — about three-and-a-half football fields — it's notable because it will come very close contact with Earth when it circles back around in 23 years.  When the asteroid was discovered in 2004, scientists initially calculated that it had a 2.7% chance of hitting Earth in 2029. While that scenario was eventually ruled out, a collision in 2036 still had a 1 in 250,000 chance. However, Apophis' Jan. 9 appearance gave scientists enough information to safely confirm that we would not, in fact, have a catastrophic run-in with the asteroid. ""The impact odds as they stand now are less than one in a million, which makes us comfortable saying we can effectively rule out an Earth impact in 2036,"" said Don Yeomans, manager of NASA's Near-Earth Object Program Office at JPL, in a press release. ""Our interest in asteroid Apophis will essentially be for its scientific interest for the foreseeable future."" SEE ALSO: Huge Asteroid's Earth Flyby Caught on Video
 Nevertheless, Apophis will still come extremely close to Earth. It will be just 19,400 miles away in 2029 and about 17,200 miles from Earth's surface in 2036. That's so close that some people in parts of the world will be able to see it in the sky with the naked eye.    Images courtesy of NASA and UH/IA "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/nokia-lumia-sales-q4/,Nokia Sold 4.4 Million Lumia Phones in Q4,"Don't count the Nokia Lumia out just yet. Nokia announced Thursday that it sold 4.4 million Lumia smartphones in the December quarter, more than it sold in each of the three previous quarters and nearly twice the number sold in the September quarter. A year ago, Nokia revealed that it had sold more than 1 million Lumias since the line of smartphones launched. The announcement came as the company released preliminary earnings results for the quarter, in which it revealed the third consecutive quarter of profitability, thanks to lower operating costs and greater-than-expected device sales. Nokia now expects its Devices & Services segment to have an operating margin of between break even and 2%, compared to a previous estimate of negative 6%. ""We are pleased that Q4 2012 was a solid quarter where we exceeded expectations and delivered underlying profitability in Devices & Services and record underlying profitability in Nokia Siemens Networks,"" Nokia's CEO Stephen Elop said in a statement. In total, Nokia sold 15.9 million smartphones for the quarter, though 9.3 million of those were Asha phones, which is a much cheaper device that is popular in Asia and Latin America.  Sales of the Lumia phone in particular were likely helped by discounts offered on certain models. Nokia slashed the price of the Lumia 900 in half last July, just three months after the device hit the U.S. market. Later in the year, Amazon cut the price of the Lumia 920 from $99 to $39 for those who signed up for a contract with AT&T. The Lumia phones have been praised by many reviewers for its sleek design and unique user interface, but sales of the device have yet to approach the levels of the leading smartphones in the market. Samsung sold 30 million Galaxy S III smartphones worldwide in just five months last year and Apple is expected to sell 45-50 million iPhones in the December quarter.  Nokia's stock jumped nearly 20% in pre-market trading on the strength of these sales figures. Image courtesy of Nokia "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/paragraph-shorts/,Paragraph Shorts App Reimagines How Readers Discover Short Fiction,"Several startups have launched apps and websites in recent years with the goal of driving readers to long-form journalism. Now, one former novelist hopes to do the same for short fiction with a new iPad magazine application called Paragraph Shorts. The free app, which launched in the iPad Newsstand Thursday, curates short stories from leading literary publications like The New Yorker, Paris Review and Zoetrope to help casual readers discover works of fiction. Each issue of the magazine contains seven short stories and creates more of a multimedia literary experience by including  text, audio and video pieces. The debut issue features works by big-name writers like Jonathan Franzen and Etgar Keret, as well as a song by the High Highs that you can have play in the background while reading.   The app was developed by Paragraph, a two-and-a-half year old publishing startup that is part of bMuse, a New York-based incubator focused on media innovation. Paragraph's co-founder and CEO Ziv Navoth has a long resume in the tech world, including executive roles at Bebo and AOL, but it was his experience as a writer that informed his vision for Paragraph Shorts. On the same day he joined Bebo in 2007, Navoth had his first and only book published. That book, called Nanotales, was a collection of short stories presented in an unusual format with no chapters or page numbers. He tried to promote the collection in bookstores, but was told not to bother ""because no one buys books of short stories."" ""The more I thought about it, the more it became clear to me that short stories, for most of their history, were locked into these physical vessels. You couldn't publish a short story and sell it to the public,"" Navoth told Mashable. As he saw it, readers traditionally either had to purchase an anthology or subscribe to literary magazines to get access to short stories, which makes it harder to find and share these works of fiction. Navoth decided to work on changing this with Paragraph, a startup whose mission statement is to ""do to the short story what iTunes did to singles - provide people with a great way to enjoy quality, bite-sized experiences, discovering not only great stories, but great writers."" The Shorts magazine is an initial step towards that goal.  Paragraph Shorts only collects short stories from websites that are not behind paywalls, which certainly limits the selection. For example, Navoth estimates that only about 10% to 15% of the short stories published in The New Yorker are available to read in their entirety for free online. Still, that leaves plenty of stories to curate, and the startup has been in touch with publishers to make select paywalled content available for free through the app. The Paris Review has already agreed to take this step. ""Someone else could make the argument that mobile devices are the last nail in the coffin of the short story, but with the right people thinking about it in the right way, there's no reason that the mobile device can't start our renaissance with the short story,"" said Lorin Stein, editor of The Paris Review. ""It's all the in the execution."" When readers click on stories in the magazine from publications other than The Paris Review, the app first loads the website where the story originally appeared — giving a page view to the publisher — and then offers the option to read a mobile-friendly version within the app. The mobile version is not paginated, which might be nice for longer reads, but users can place a bookmark at any point within the text. There are also options to share stories to Facebook and Twitter, favorite stories from various issues to read later as well as recommendations for similar stories and links to other works from that author. The hope going forward is that the magazine app will be to use social recommendations to power suggestions for what to read next. Navoth says he's also interested in the idea of opening the magazine up to submissions. The problem, as he puts it, is that then the app might start to turn into more of a traditional literary magazine ""with a slush pile of thousands of stories"" that someone needs to sort though.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/parents-blame-video-games-violence-kids/,77% of Parents Blame Video Games For Exposing Kids to Violence,"A new study from Common Sense Media shows the majority of parents (75%) feel that shielding children from violence is difficult. That same percentage of parents blame ""media violence, such as content in TV, movies and video games"" for adding to ""America’s culture of violence.""  For this survey, conducted by USA Market Research, 1,050 parents with children ages 18 years and younger were randomly selected to share their opinions. Results revealed that 88% of parents said violent ads should be prevented from airing during programs largely watched by children. What's more, 91% want theaters to show previews that only have the same or lower rating than the movie being shown.  SEE ALSO: 3 Ways to Keep Tabs on Your Kids Online  ""Parents are clearly concerned about how violence in media may be impacting their children,"" James Steyer, founder and CEO of Common Sense Media, said in a statement. ""Our culture of violence seems to have made it the new normal that parents who take their kids to a movie theatre or gather to watch a football game are at risk of exposing them to inappropriate content that is marketing video games, or films rated for more mature audiences."" In addition to content that children see in the media, parents were also asked about other factors contributing to violence in America. Parents said they worry about bullying (92%), access to guns (75%) and current levels of crime (86%).

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/reddit-photography-buzzfeed/,Redditors Accuse BuzzFeed of Photo Theft,"A thread at the top of Reddit's most popular photography group, r/photography,  accuses BuzzFeed of ""stealing people's long exposure pics ... without any permission"" for a sponsored post advertising a camera on the site. The BuzzFeed post, ""14 Amazing Photos That Are Totally Not Photoshopped,"" is a list of images taken with a camera's shutter open for an extended time, a technique commonly used for star trail and ""light drawing"" photography. Samsung sponsored the article to promote the Galaxy Camera's ""Light Trace"" mode, a feature that helps people take these increasingly popular photos.  Several of the original photos in the article, according to Redditors posting in the thread, were taken from Reddit or Imgur (the most popular image host among the Reddit community) without permission of the photographers or proper link credit. Most of the sources were originally listed as ""Imgur"" — when clicked, brought readers to a hosted .JPG file, devoid of ownership information.  Images courtesy Frame52, James Vernacotola Following the complaints, BuzzFeed switched the photos in favor of Flickr content licensed under Creative Commons.  ""We were very concerned we were pissing off people in that community,"" said Jonah Peretti, co-founder of BuzzFeed, ""And we've already removed all of those images and updated the post. It was something just designed to show how cool that sort of photography is. Sometimes I think Imgur confuses the sourcing of which images wind up out there. And we quickly corrected it when we were able to discover who the actual photographer was and that he was upset that it was used."" When asked if BuzzFeed should take steps to identify photographers before a post like this goes live, Peretti agreed that it should. ""If we can find the person yes, for sure,"" he said. ""I think that sometimes we have trouble finding the person."" One Redditor proved the straightforwardness of sourcing the photos. Mtranda did ""40 minutes of research"" and was able to identify the photographers behind most of the images. ""We really regret that we made these awesome, creative people upset,"" said Peretti. ""And we would love to talk to any of them directly to figure out how to work together in the future on this stuff."" Peretti emphasized that BuzzFeed, not Samsung, was the creative force behind the post. ""It was a BuzzFeed post, not a Samsung post. They sponsored it, but it was a BuzzFeed post,"" he said. Samsung has yet to respond to Mashable's request for comment. SEE ALSO: How to Use Creative Commons Visuals Although several of the Redditors posting in the thread are upset at BuzzFeed for the post, others blame the photographers themselves for uploading the images to Imgur, from which photos may be easily taken without adequate sourcing.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/report-steve-jobs-pleaded-with-former-hp-ceo-mark-hurd-not-to-leave-hp/,Report: Steve Jobs Offered to Help Former HP CEO Mark Hurd Get His Job Back,"Mark Hurd resigned as CEO and Chairman of Hewlett-Packard in 2010 after an investigation into whether he sexually harassed one of HP's contractors, but at least one influential person didn't want to see him leave: Steve Jobs. Shortly after HP announced Hurd's resignation, Jobs reached out to Hurd to offer his perspective — as someone who had also been forced out of a company years before — and urged Hurd to return to HP, according to a new report in Bloomberg Businessweek. ""The pair spent more than two hours together, Jobs taking Hurd on his customary walk around [his] tree-lined neighborhood. At numerous points during their conversation, Jobs pleaded with Hurd to do whatever it took to set things right with the board so that Hurd could return,"" the report says, citing multiple anonymous sources familiar with the exchange. ""Jobs even offered to write a letter to HP’s directors and to call them up one by one."" Jobs apparently believed that without Hurd in charge, HP's board would undo the progress Hurd had made as the head of the company and do significant damage to the business. Ironically enough, it was one of Jobs closest friends — Larry Ellison — who ultimately undermined that effort by convincing Hurd to work at Oracle, rather than return to HP. Since then, HP has had two CEOs, some disastrous business decisions and the stock has tanked to its lowest level in a decade. Perhaps Jobs was right to worry. It might sound strange that Jobs would offer to go out of his way to help a company that competes with Apple on several fronts, but HP was more than just a competitor to Jobs, it was a key part of Silicon Valley and his personal history in the tech world.  Jobs has repeatedly said that the company's founders Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard were his heroes growing up, and he famously called up Hewlett at age 12 for spare parts. Hewlett laughed, gave him the parts he wanted and even gave him a summer job working on the assembly line at HP. The story of the exchange between Hurd and Jobs is reminiscent of another anecdote about Jobs' soft spot for HP. During his final visit to Apple's campus before resigning as chairman of the company, some of Apple's board members gloated about the recent news that HP was abandoning WebOs and the TouchPad — its iPad competitor. Rather than celebrate this, as some on the board might have expected, Jobs lamented the news. “Hewlett and Packard built a great company, and they thought they had left it in good hands. But now it’s being dismembered and destroyed,"" Jobs told the group, according to Walter Isaacson's biography of the former Apple co-founder. “I hope I’ve left a stronger legacy so that will never happen at Apple.""

Some items make it into the cart, others do not. Thanks to the check-out counter, retailers know when something’s been bought, but not much about what made you stop and choose it in the first place. Now, 3D sensing technology may offer an unlikely, yet powerful, solution. In a small suite adjacent to the massive CES 2013 convention hall, Primesense and partner Shopperperception showed me a rather remarkable technology that uses the former’s 3D sensing technology, and an iPad-based analytics app to give retailers an aggregated view of what shoppers are doing at store shelves. Primesense, which unveiled its tiny Capri 3D sensor at the show, also provides the 3D sensing technology for Microsoft’s Kinect for the Xbox 360.  Its low-cost, tiny motherboards bathe the area in front of it in an infrared 3D mesh that a second camera interprets.  It’s how interactive games know not only where multiple people are in a room, but also exactly what each of them is doing. It’s obviously super useful for virtual dancing and driving, but as Primsense demonstrated to me, the open platform can do far more than just play games.  In the case of Shopperception, a Primesense 3D sensor sits high above a store shelf. It’s so small that most shoppers probably wouldn’t notice it, and it’s not taking pictures. Instead the sensor is watching as people touch products on the shelf, take them off the shelf and even as they put them back. Shopperception's app aggregates the data for all the shoppers who interacted with the shelves to create a real-time consumer response report. There’s even a heat map to show which items had the most — and least —shopper activity. Primsense execs tell me that Shopperception is already in some stores and a typical use case scenario is one brand (like Heineken) or manufacturer setting it up to evaluate how their own products and promotions are doing. You can see Shopperception in action in the video above. Watch and the let us know in the comments what you think of the latest innovation in retail.

LAS VEGAS — New York Jets player Tim Tebow launched a line of headphones on Thursday with audio accessories company Soul Electronics, featuring high-endurance models for athletes, as well as a business-inspired pair called the ""Jet."" Tebow unveiled the new line at the 2013 International CES conference in Las Vegas under the Soul Electronics brand, which was founded by rapper and actor Ludacris. In addition to the Jet, Tebow has become a brand ambassador for the company's flagship SL300 signature headphone series — the latest model is available in blue, white and black for limited release. Meanwhile, Tebow's Combat+ line features noise-cancelling technology and is designed for athletes, as well as more casual users. When a Soul Electronics spokesperson introduced the Jet headphones, she said it might not be called this for ""too much longer — we might change the name,"" alluding to the possibility of a looming trade. ""I'm just kidding,"" she added. (Tebow turned red and laughed along with the press). When asked if he regrets the name, he said: ""It's also called the Jet because it's the executive line for people who fly across the country ... and are flying in jets."" (More laughter followed). Tebow said he was most directly involved with developing his Combat+ line. ""I was so interested in having something comfortable I could practice on the field in before games,"" Tebow said. ""So many headphones can feel good and sound great, but when you're warming up, they fall off and that is a big distraction. We came up with these Combat models to help you keep that focus.""  Despite it being an already saturated market with a big increase in celebrity-branded headphone lines — including one from reality TV star Snooki that also launched this week — Tebow said his collection is appealing for all types of people. ""People who try them out will hopefully believe in them,"" Tebow said. ""We have headphones for athletes who want to train and some for those who want to fly or even sleep. They are even great for moms who are doing the dishes and listening to their country or gospel music. Whoever you are, whatever you are doing, we have something that fits you.""    Tebow, who said it was his first time at CES, called the huge tech conference ""a whirlwind.""  ""I've seen a lot of cool stuff,"" he said. ""That fork that helps you lose weight is pretty crazy.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/triptern/,Trip Tern Will Create Your Travel Itinerary,"The Launchpad is a series that introduces Mashable readers to compelling startups. If you would like to have your startup considered for inclusion, please see the details here. Name: Trip Tern One-Liner Pitch: Trip Tern will plan out the itinerary for your next getaway. Why It's Taking Off: Trip Tern’s goal is to make your travel planning easier by creating an itinerary that includes information about your city, hotel and interests. Planning a trip to a new city is time-consuming and often requires researching restaurants, hotels, transportation and more on various travel websites. Now, one India-based startup hopes to simplify that process by being a one-stop destination for all your trip planning needs. Trip Tern is a social travel site that prepares your own travel itinerary for your next trip in just a few minutes. Users can select the destination, hotel, dates and attractions that they’re interested in, and Trip Tern will create an itinerary with all of the information. Trip Tern also provides a map that shows the location of the hotel and attractions nearby. “We found that when planning your own trips, travel sites just give you information and a list of places to see without any direction,” Shailendra Sason, co-founder of Trip Tern, told Mashable. “Trip Tern creates the perfect itinerary so that you have an optimized plan for however long you are staying in a city.”  Users can edit the itineraries as needed to suit any changes to their travel plans.  Similar to the online travel organizer TripIt, Trip Tern lets you share your itinerary online with friends and family. TripIt’s itinerary feature, however, allows users to include more detailed information about their trips, such as flight and hotel details, weather and driving directions. Although users cannot book hotels on Trip Tern, the company plans to add this option and earn revenue from it in the future. The team is also considering giving users the option to contact travel agents in their desired city directly from the site. As you visit new destinations from Trip Tern’s list of cities, you can build a collection of your trips with photos that you can share with friends. Trip Tern also lets you keep up with your friends’ travel adventures by showing you their photos and details about their trips each time you log on to the site. Trip Tern is currently in beta and has 6,000 users, many of whom have been exploring New York and London as possible travel destinations. Although there are only 16 cities to choose from on its website, the company will soon add more cities in Europe, North America and South America. The startup is also planning to develop a mobile app, create a local language glossary and add details about weather and transportation to itineraries. Trip Tern is self-funded and expects to launch publicly in March. Images courtesy of Flickr, mkosut and Trip Tern "

Well, probably a lot like this:  The stunning recreation was done by Tadao Cern, an architect and photographer from Lithuania. On his personal site, Cern also gave the project a funny backstory: Some time ago a stranger asked me to make his portrait ... So I did. I sent him the image and I never heard back from him again since that moment. Not long ago I saw one painting and I felt that it was very familiar to me. And then I got it — It was a copy of my photo! I did a little research on that and it seem that the guy who draw(copied) it is quite well known around... His name is Vincent Van Gogh or something ... Pity that he never mentioned me and I can't find his contact now.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/why-are-people-still-buying-cds/,Why Are People Still Buying CDs?,"Amazon announced AutoRip on Thursday, a free service that gives consumers a cloud-based backup for every CD they've bought from the company since 1998. For Amazon, it's another move towards ensuring that consumers consider the company their primary stream of content, whatever the format. However, the introduction of the service raises another question: Why are people still buying CDs in 2013? After all, most music is available online in a format that's usually cheaper than CDs and doesn't take up shelf space.  Yet, the CD is still the predominant format for music buying. Consumers bought 193 million CDs in 2012 vs. 118 million digitally downloaded albums, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Though digital continues to grow at a rapid clip, it will probably be a couple of years before CD buyers become the minority. There's also reason to believe that CDs will still hold a significant share of the market for some time. Sound quality Though there's some debate on the issue, David Bakula, SVP of client development for Nielsen, believes that the sound quality of downloaded music isn't on par with music on a CD. However, it's worth noting that the quality of older CDs may actually be worse now than a decade or so ago thanks to the so-called Loudness War that prompted engineers to apply a high rate of compression to old recordings to make them louder.  Hard-core audiophiles, however, can seek out optimized digital recordings and/or vinyl recordings to get a purer sound.  Technology Lag If you live on either coast or in a major city, you may get the impression that everyone is on Spotify and has an iPhone. However, there are only two markets — Hawaii and San Francisco — in which people download music more than they buy CDs, according to Nielsen. Meanwhile, there are markets and genres in which CD buying is the norm. A couple of analysts mentioned country music as a genre in which the majority of purchases are still via CD. ""Country fans are still going to big chains [to buy music],"" says Glenn Peoples, senior editorial analyst at Billboard.  ""The majority of music buyers purchase CDs and don’t buy digital so there’s a large non-digital population,"" says Russ Crupnick, SVP of industry analysis for The NPD Group. ""They simply never had the need or motivation to buy digital downloads.""  Bakula also noted that in 1994, when CDs had been out for a few years and had come down to mainstream pricing levels, cassettes still claimed 40% of the market. Cars People still listen to a lot of their music in their cars, which are still adapting to the digital changes. ""As long as cars have CD players, there's a market for them,"" says Crupnick.  Tangibility Bakula notes that CD sales always spike in the fourth quarter because you just can't wrap a download. As Peoples also notes, up-and-coming bands still like to hand out or sell CDs at gigs rather than merely direct users to a URL.  ""Market research shows people buy CDs out of habit,"" Bakula says. ""They also buy when they really like the artist. They want a physical package with the artwork. CDs offer that offer a kind of connection with the artist."" Crupnick agrees: ""Uber fans like to have the physical version in addition to/instead of digital for artists where they have a strong affinity."" What do you think? Are you still buying CDs? Are you still mystified that other people do? Let us know in the comments. Image courtesy of iStockphoto, Technology02 "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/winbot-hands-on/,Hands On With a Window-Cleaning Robot," LAS VEGAS — We’re still decades away from Rosie the Robot-style house-cleaning robots, but smaller, single-purpose robots are here today and more and more of them are ready to tackle the jobs we absolutely do not want to do. Unveiled here at CES 2013, Ecovac’s Winbot Series 7 is actually the company’s second-generation Window-cleaning robot.  The old model was a two-piece device that used magnets to cling windows (one magnet on the inside and another on the outside). But Series 7 is a single AC-powered device. We took it for a test-spin on the floor of CES. Winbot Series 7 is square with rounded corners and a large handle. While it feels substantial, it’s not heavy. Using it was a bit more complicated than I expected. You start by adding a bit of solution to the cleaning surfaces on the base. Then you have to place it on the Window surface, turn it on (there’s a slider switch under the handle), and hold it against the window while Winbot builds up enough suction to hang on.  This took about 30 seconds. The whole time the robot made a tiny whirring sound as it created a vacuum seal between it and the dirty window. After that, it was smooth sailing. Winbot immediately started moving about the window, measuring the space and mapping out a cleaning plan. It then started cleaning and worked until it decided the surface was completely clean.  When finished, the robot returns to exactly where you started. It makes little tones at the start and finish of each cleaning task. Because it includes a squeegee system, there is no residue, or liquid of any sort, left on the window when Winbot was done. Not bad.  Winbot arrives later this year with an expected retail price of between $299 and $399. Check out the video above to see Winbot in action — and let us know in the comments if you think this could replace your window cleaner. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/wireless-gadgets-break-internet/,How Wireless Gadgets Are Breaking the Internet,"Behind all the dazzling mobile-ready electronics products on display at the International CES in Las Vegas this week is a looming problem: how to make the networks that support all these wireless devices function robustly and efficiently.  With less fanfare than you’d see in Vegas, potential solutions are arising in labs in like Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, and New Brunswick, New Jersey. The grand challenge is to overhaul the Internet to better serve an expected flood of 15 billion network-connected devices by 2015—many of them mobile—up from five billion today, according to Intel estimates. The Internet was designed in the 1960s to dispatch data to fixed addresses of static PCs connected to a single network, but today it connects a riot of diverse gadgets that can zip from place to place and connect to many different networks. As the underlying networks have been reworked and added-to to make way for new technologies, some serious inefficiencies and security problems have arisen. ""Nobody really expects the network to crash when you add one more device,"" says Peter Steenkiste, computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University. ""But I do have a sense this is more of a creeping problem of complexity."" Over the past year, fundamentally new network designs have taken shape and are being tested at universities around the United States under the National Science Foundation's Future Internet Architectures Project, launched in 2010. One key idea is that networks should be able to obtain data from the nearest location — not seek it from some specific data center at a fixed address. ""Today I have on my desk a smartphone, a tablet and a Mac computer. To move data between them, today the request goes all the way to the cloud — God knows where that is — so it can come back here to another device that is two feet away,"" says Lixia Zhang, a computer scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""That is wrong, it is simply wrong."" Things would work quite differently under the Named Data Networking (NDN) project that Zhang heads. Under NDN, data packets are assigned addresses that emphasize the information they contain — not just the IP address of where they came from or where they are going. These codes could, among other things, allow easy sharing of data directly between devices.  ""In the end, I think we can improve the speed, throughput, and overall efficiency. Today you have many data centers that can have thousands of people asking for same piece of data. In the NDN system, you just find the nearest copy of that data,"" says Zhang. ""Conceptually, this is pretty simple, but it is really a revolution."" This data-centric concept allows security and privacy settings to be cryptographically attached directly to the data—with different settings depending on how sensitive the data is—rather than relying on measures such as VPNs and firewalls. In addition to Zhang’s project, the NSF effort also funds Internet architecture projects with similar goals at Rutgers, the University of Pennsylvania, and CMU, where Steenkiste runs the expressive Internet architecture, or XIA, project. David Clark, the MIT computer scientist and the Internet’s former chief protocol architect, says it’s too early to say which will win out. “All are research, all are speculative, and are potentially exciting,” he says, but he adds that the NDN effort “is the most revolutionary—the project really changes the underlying model of what a network does. It replaces communication among end-points with access to data, wherever it may be.” Several early demonstrations of these new Internet architecture projects have taken place over the past year, and more are expected in 2013. It is early days for these efforts, says Dipankar Raychaudhuri, head of the Rutgers Winlab, who runs its NSF-funded Mobility First project, which tries to make mobile devices and car networks a more seamless part of the infrastructure. Still, he predicts that “in another two years, you should be able to see comparative evaluations and metrics,” that show the value of the projects. Among other things, new architectures could allow devices to attach to two or more networks at the same time. Today your smartphone can switch back and forth between, say, 4G and Wi-Fi, but not use them both and combine the data coming from each. The root of the problem is that the original protocols assumed only a single network interface. “You could, in principle, remain connected to both networks, and the network could decide how to send you the data at each moment,” Raychaudhuri says. Meanwhile, some existing applications help fill a gap. For example, the network optimization company Akamai — which runs 119,000 servers and delivers between 15 and 30% of the web’s traffic — has for several years been offering something called Net Session. This application allows device-to-device file transfers, rather than server-to-device downloads, and is popular in developing countries where connectivity is poor. So far, Net Session has been installed on 30 million devices, most of them laptops. “The goal is to expand it so it can support mobile handsets, tablets, and media-type boxes at home,” says Kris Alexander, director of strategy at Akamai.  However, making that leap is no small feat. No Net Session app for iOS or Android is available, and the main reason is that the necessary processing power and battery drain is too large.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/zte-firefox-smartphone/,ZTE Plans to Launch Firefox OS Smartphone in Europe in 2013,"China's ZTE has teamed up with an unnamed European carrier to build a smartphone based on Firefox OS, Bloomberg reports. The companies plan to launch the device in Europe this year.  According to CEO of ZTE’s U.S. unit Cheng Lixin, the company might also launch a Firefox OS-based device in the U.S. in 2013.  “We closely monitor the ecosystem and how it evolves. If that is ready and if consumer studies support that data, then we may launch one in U.S. also this year,” Cheng said.  He did not disclose any additional details about the device's specifications or pricing.  Vice president of products at Mozilla Jay Sullivan confirmed the company is working with ZTE, as well as Qualcomm and TCL on Firefox OS-based devices.  Mozilla had announced Firefox OS in July 2012 as a fully open alternative to Android, promising first devices would arrive in 2013. It seems they'll be on schedule, though the road ahead is long and hard, especially since Android and iOS are quickly overtaking market share from smaller competitors.  Image credit: Mozilla "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/10/zurb-acquires-forrst/,Forrst Has Been Acquired For the Second Time in One Year,"It's tough enough for a startup to get acquired once, but one company has just been acquired for the second time in a year. Forrst, an online community for designers and developers, has been acquired by interactive design firm Zurb for an undisclosed sum, Zurb announced Thursday. Forrst had previously been acquired by another design community called Colourlovers in March, 2012. The startup was created by Kyle Bragger back in 2009 and the service gradually attracted tens of thousands of users. After Forrst was acquired the first time, Bragger decided to leave the company and join Fancy Hands, a virtual assistant startup, as a product engineer. In the meantime, Colourlovers did little to update or change Forrst — for better or worse. Bryan Zmijewski, the chief instigator at Zurb, tells Mashable that his company has been aware of Forrst for some time, and an ""opportunity presented itself"" recently to acquire the company and the team felt it fit in with their long-term vision. ""Our purpose as a business is to help people design for people. Much of what you see online over the last 15 years has evolved, but the people-component of what people are designing for is missing,"" Zmijewski told Mashable. ""A lot of that happens through design feedback. Forrst aligns with that vision."" Zurb already has laid out steps to improve Forrst's website and boost engagement among the community. It plans to streamline the site's interface by implementing responsive design and reward users who share quality posts on the service with more invites. While Bragger is longer affiliated with Forrst, he told Mashable that he believes Zurb will be a ""better fit"" for the startup than Colourlovers.  ""They're focusing back on the basics with Forrst being a place for real constructive criticism from peers and industry leaders, improving your craft as a developer,"" Bragger said. ""It sounds like they are doing all the right things in terms of what I would do to hit reset and get Forrst back to a good place."" Image courtesy of Zurb "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/5-chinese-tech-brands-to-watch/,5 Chinese Tech Brands You'll Be Hearing From in 2013,"As John F. Kennedy once noted, the Chinese word for ""crisis"" is composed of the characters for ""danger"" and ""opportunity."" So characteristically, amid the hand-wringing at CES about the show's decreased relevance, a handful of Chinese brands saw a big opportunity.  In fact, the emergence of several Chinese brands as wannabe major players became one of the central narratives of the show. Typically at CES, Chinese tech brands are relegated to the International Pavilion rather than the show proper.  This year, though, there were at least five brands from China — Hisense, ZTE, TCL, Huawei and Haier — that took the main stage or at least got treated seriously by the press.  Next up: Convincing U.S. consumers that Chinese brands equal high quality. Despite the fact that most U.S. electronics are actually manufactured in China these days, U.S. consumers still view Chinese brands on a lower plane, says Hayes Roth, CMO of Landor Associates, a branding consultancy. However, those beliefs can change.  Roth pointed out that Japanese brands Sony and Panasonic set the precedent for changing U.S. mindsets in the 1960s. Buoyed by a simultaneous influx of Japanese auto brands, the U.S. public slowly began to have a different view of ""Made in Japan,"" Roth says. ""The Japanese got around that by reinventing quality control,"" Roth says. ""They became the gold standard."" A generation later, South Korean brands LG, Hyundai, Kia and Samsung convinced U.S. consumers that Korean goods could go toe-to-toe with Japanese products. Samsung, in particular, likely provides an aspirational road map for Chinese brands. In 2012, the brand successfully battled the perception that it was an Apple copycat with a slew of innovative, quality products. Samsung is now the top producer of cell phones in the world and its smartphones outsell Apple's by a roughly two-to-one margin.  However, success for the following brands is far from a given. Roth notes for instance that, despite its lead in the marketplace, the China-based Lenovo ""hasn't become a dominant brand."" In the footwear category, Li-Neng, known as the Nike of China, is still pretty obscure in the U.S., even though it's earned high-profile U.S. endorsers like Dwyane Wade. Another cautionary tale is HTC, the Taiwanese telecom brand whose quick ascendance in the U.S. has been followed by an equally swift collapse.  Despite the odds, the following Chinese brands saw CES as their springboard for a breakout 2013:  Hisense
  Hisense has been established in the U.S. since 2001 and makes TVs, refrigerators, freezers and air conditioners, among other products. Since 2007, it has achieved 30% annual growth. In 2012, the company posted $2 billion in sales. By 2015, it aims to achieve a total of $5 billion in sales. At CES, Hisense got attention by showing off a 110-inch ultra HD TV, a Smart TV controlled by gestures and voice and a glasses-free 3D TV. The company also makes Android phones.

  ZTE has had a U.S. presence since 1995. The company manufactures phones for Verizon, among others, but plans to make a bigger name for itself in 2013 with a Firefox OS-based smartphone. ZTE plans to release the device in Europe — and possibly the U.S. — this year. ""They're really expanding their range and their portfolio,""  Image credit: Mozilla TCL
 TCL is the world's fourth-largest TV producer after Samsung, LG and Sony. At CES, TCL displayed an Android-based TV called Ice Screen that includes Frequency, a video curation app that lets you subscribe to BBC, CNN and other channels. Huawei
  Huawei sought to stand out from the pack at CES with the Ascend P1 S, which is billed as the ""world's slimmest smartphone"" at 6.68 mm and the Ascend D2 smartphone, which sports a 6.2-inch screen.  Image courtesy of Huawei Haier

http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/alien-life-exoplanet-moons/,Alien Life May Exist on Exoplanet Moons,"In the search for an Earth-like alien world, astronomers have had their eyes set on planets beyond our solar system, but some moons orbiting these exoplanets may be just as likely to support life, scientists say. Astronomers have discovered more than 800 exoplanets, with many more candidate worlds awaiting confirmation by follow-up observations. Most of them, however, are gas giants, similar to Jupiter, and only a handful have a solid surface and orbit their host stars in the habitable zone (the range where liquid water, and perhaps life as we know it, can exist). But a team of astronomers says these uninhabitable exoplanets could host habitable exomoons. ""There is a habitable zone for exomoons, it's just a little different than the habitable zone for exoplanets,"" Rory Barnes of the University of Washington and the NASA Astrobiology Institute said in a statement. Barnes and René Heller of Germany's Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam explained that considerations about climate and light would be very different for exomoons compared with exoplanets. Like Earth's moon, many exomoons are tidally locked to their host planet, meaning one hemisphere is permanently turned away from the planet, which would constrain the habitable regions on the moon's surface. Moons also have two sources of light — one from their star and the other from their host planet — and are subject to dramatic eclipses. ""An observer standing on the surface of such an exomoon would experience day and night in a totally different way than we do on Earth,"" Heller said. ""For instance, stellar eclipses could lead to sudden total darkness at noon."" The astronomers, whose research is detailed in the January issue of the journal Astrobiology, say the effects of tidal heating must be considered when determining an exomoon's habitability. Moons that orbit their planet too closely will experience strong tidal heating and a runaway greenhouse effect that would boil away any surface water. Though no habitable exomoons have been found, Barnes and Heller say there's no reason to assume they don't exist. Some researchers have already started thinking about how they might use instruments like the planet-hunting Kepler Space Telescope to detect alien moons. Telescopes such as Kepler search for planets as they transit, or cross in front of, their star, causing telltale dips in the star's brightness. Variations in these brightness patterns might reveal the presence of a moon orbiting a planet. Image courtesy of Science and Analysis Laboratory, NASA-Johnson Space Center

http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/aspire-assist/,This Gadget Sucks Food Out of Your Stomach," Counting calories? No need to worry about that anymore. A team of gastroenterologists have developed a weight-loss gadget, called AspireAssist, that pumps food directly out of the stomach after a meal is consumed. The team says it's an ideal way for anyone struggling with obesity to shed a few pounds. The AspireAssist pairs with a valve that's surgically implanted into the user's stomach (see image below.) About 20 minutes after each meal, users can drain up to a third of what they just ate through the valve.  From the website: The aspiration process is performed about 20 minutes after the entire meal is consumed and takes 5 to 10 minutes to complete. The process is performed in the privacy of the restroom, and the food is drained directly into the toilet. Because aspiration only removes a third of the food, the body still receives the calories it needs to function. For optimal weight loss, patients should aspirate after each major meal (about 3 times per day) initially. Over time, as patients learn to eat more healthfully, they can reduce the frequency of aspirations The gadget was tested on 24 obese participants in Europe. After a year-long trial, the company says, the patients lost an average of 45 pounds each.  Not everyone is completely sold. Several health bloggers have referred to the gadget as a ""medically assisted bulimia"" kit, arguing that flushing out 30% of a meal directly after consumption doesn't allow enough time for nutrients to be absorbed.

 AspireAssist was recently patented by Segway inventor Dean Kamen. But the FDA has yet to approve the gadget, according to Popsci. Watch the video up top to learn more. Would you try AspireAssist?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/big-data-design-privacy/,Designing for the Hidden Dangers in Big Data,"Joe Carberry is a partner at Brunswick Group LLC, advising on corporate reputation and issues management. He holds a CIPP/US certification from the International Association of Privacy Professionals. In this era of clouds and big data, information has become a valuable commodity. Even organizations that are not traditionally in the technology space now deal with massive amounts of consumer data — from airlines to clothing retailers, universities to non-profits.  But if that data includes individuals’ personal information, such as images, credit card numbers or shopping habits, alarm bells should be going off for business leaders. Issues around privacy and data security are increasing and can have a huge, public impact on business operations.  But they also can do significant damage to another valuable business commodity: customer trust.  So, for many businesses, the approach to safeguarding data is quickly becoming a top priority. And if it hasn’t yet, it soon will be. According to IBM, more than 2.5 quintillion new bytes of information are created each day. In this environment, it has become commonplace — some say essential — for organizations to use personal information to make better products, track performance or deliver the right content. Great things are possible with access to data. But as the use of data grows, so will the use of personal information associated with new devices and services. The flood of mobile technologies will only accelerate this trend. Mobile data traffic last year was eight times greater than all Internet traffic in 2000, according to Cisco’s Virtual Networking Index. Mobile-connected devices will exceed the global population by the end of 2012, according to the study. Even if it is increasingly common, use of sensitive information creates the potential for enormous risk.  Years ago, managing that risk was a compliance issue, often handled solely by engineers and attorneys.  No longer. Today, privacy concerns and missteps are frequently front-page news. Even the most responsible companies can make mistakes, and even the safest can fall victim to attack. If something goes wrong, it can spread in minutes on Twitter, Facebook and blogs, which reach all of a company’s critical audiences.
   
This increased awareness drives expectations higher. People tend to believe that data about them is theirs and tend to react strongly when companies fail to meet their expectations around privacy and security. This includes policymakers who oversee industries; investors who do not want to see issues become a drag on performance; and, of course, consumers who use a company’s products and services.   According to a recent TRUSTe survey, 91% of consumers worry about online privacy. Eighty-eight percent of them say they would avoid doing business with companies that don't protect their privacy. So, what can company leadership do? It can ensure brands are prepared to deal with the main types of risk related to data. This includes risk and operational issues, legal and regulatory issues and risks to reputation. Most companies work hard to ensure they have risk management and operational controls in place to protect the information in their care. Likewise, most companies have attorneys in place who apply sound policies and legal protections that guide appropriate behavior. However, many companies simply overlook the need to make a forward-looking investment in protecting their reputation in the event of a problem with private data. More and more companies are now adopting what is called “Privacy by Design,” a strategic approach that weaves responsible privacy practices into the entire life cycle of product design and development.  It helps make privacy part of an organization’s DNA. Similarly, many smart companies are starting to think about customer trust related to big data, and are building reputation into their technology innovation and product development cycles. Call it “Reputation by Design.” Companies following this approach present customers with a clear and compelling reason for their collection or use of personal data. They offer context around those decisions.  And they have taken steps to prepare for a day when they may have to address problems in a transparent manner.   To build trust in the realm of big data, it is critical to start before something goes wrong. In this regard, management should be thinking about three things: Know what’s happening. Understand what information is gathered, why and how it is used. Companies also should understand what steps are being taken to protect that information. And they should know how their practices compare to industry norms as well as what people expect. Be willing to share. Everyone benefits from more information; no one benefits from surprises. Think about how to be as clear and open as possible about data practices with all audiences. Nearly every company will have to address big data issues at some point. Establishing a positive, transparent track record now can help address issues that may arise down the road. Get ready to respond. All companies should be well prepared to handle their worst-case scenario. No one should start planning for a major problem after it happens. A small investment now can make a huge difference later. In the end, every business is dependent on the trust of its customers for success. Those customers increasingly see real value in companies that can demonstrate care in the handling of their information.  To maintain trust, organizations need to take visible steps to meet — or exceed — customer expectations around privacy and security.  People believe that safeguarding their personal information is the right thing to do. That alone makes it the smart thing for a business to do. Image courtesy of Flickr, Eduardo Loureiro. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/booth-babes-ces/,CEA on 'Booth Babes': The Name Is the Problem,"Following widespread criticism of the use of models to market products at the International CES, a CEA exec tells Mashable that the media is to blame — for repeating the commonly-used term ""booth babes."" According to Karen Chupka, senior vice president of the Consumer Electronics Association, the industry giant has no plans to remove models from CES. ""The story has been overly sensationalized,"" Chupka says. ""A lot of people are hired to come in and support exhibitors, since the booth is only one-third of the cost of attending the event.  ""I can't understand. This is the year 2013, and I thought women had come farther than this. I'm really appalled that anybody prints the word 'babe' and thinks that's okay."" Using temporary employees is a key way for companies to cut costs, Chupka adds. CEA recommends temporary staffing agency Judy Venn & Associates to out-of-town presenters, which describes its services as ""trade show staffing, convention models, trade show hostesses.""  CEA CEO Gary Shapiro admitted to the BBC last year that ""people naturally want to go toward what they consider pretty,"" highlighting the overarching motivation to employ models at trade shows. Shapiro also called the BBC's story on booth babes ""cute, but frankly irrelevant.""  Chupka, on the other hand, understood why scantily-dressed models can touch a nerve for some trade show attendees.  ""I can understand why people have different feelings about what's comfortable to them,"" Chupka says. ""I walked in and saw a man in a completely tight body suit and thought, 'Hmm that's a little interesting.' Women walk around in yoga pants. Why? Because they're comfortable."" Yoga pants, however, are a far cry from the body paint and thongs captured in the photo above by Mashable reporter Emily Price. The women at the booth were painted, put on display and described as ""fembots."" Attendees were encouraged to Instagram and share photos using the hashtag #getmore. Here's what Chupka had to say about that booth: ""They were covered in paint. It's seen a lot at the European shows.""  SEE ALSO: From Ada Lovelace to Marissa Mayer: The Rise of Women in Tech  
 The CEA claims to distributes a disclaimer to attendees, encouraging caution. ""The rules in the PR manuals that go out to the companies planning the event are that they should be properly attired according to decency laws,"" Chupka says.  ""We remind them that the audience is diverse, and they should take into consideration how they display their products."" Mashable requested a copy of the clause in the PR manual dictating attire. The CEA directed us to the Exhibitor Manual, though after thorough searching (and further questioning the CEA), we were unable to locate the regulations Chupka mentioned. Increasing the number of women in science and technology jobs is an ongoing struggle in 2013. The presence of scantily-dressed, overly-sexualized female figures at industry events could, arguably, prevent women from feeling comfortable in that environment.  According to a U.S. Deptartment of Commerce report, ""Women in STEM: A Gender Gap to Innovation,"" women hold about half of jobs in the U.S., but less than a quarter of STEM jobs. Just 14% of women are engineers and less than 10% of venture-backed companies were co-founded by women. As the BBC notes, that's the reason why China has made the use of models at trade shows illegal.  But Chupka demurs. ""It's not our policy, because each company should get to choose how they want to present itself,"" she says. ""Our show represents a wide variety of industry segments. For us to say you must fit within a role would be like saying you have to dress like a pilgrim."" SEE ALSO: 7 Tips for Women in the Tech Industry
 To its credit, the CEA itself runs contrary to the industry trend. The association employs 87 women out of a total staff of 139. Of the 40 members of senior staff, 22 are women.  Photo by Emily Price, Mashable "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/cheap-iphone-unclear/,Is Apple Coming Out With a Cheaper iPhone? The Answer Is Unclear,"Recent rumors about a cheaper iPhone have recently been all but debunked by Apple's SVP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller, who told Chinese newspaper Shanghai Evening News that ""cheap smartphones will never be the future of Apple products"".  Based on Schiller's comment, Reuters and several other news outlets have reported that Apple has probably dismissed the idea of a cheap iPhone. The story doesn't end there, though, as Reuters had withdrawn that article, claiming it ""was subsequently updated with substantial changes to its content."" Reuters said that no replacement story will be issued.  It is unclear what the ""substantial changes"" to Reuters' story were. We can imagine several possible scenarios: Shanghai Evening News could have gotten the quote from Schiller wrong, or Reuters could have gotten credible info from another source that Apple is indeed working on a cheaper iPhone.  In any case, the future of the ""cheap iPhone"" is still undetermined. After Apple's launch of iPad mini, the idea of a cheaper iPhone (iPhone Mini, perhaps?) became much more plausible, with reports claiming it would be manufactured from cheaper materials than iPhone 5, with price ranging from $99 to $149. Right now, iPhone 4 remains the cheapest Apple smartphone, which can be had for $0 with a contract or $450 without one.  Image credit: Apple "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/facebook-message-mark-zuckerberg/,Facebook Charging $100 to Message Mark Zuckerberg,"We knew Facebook was eager for new revenue streams. We just didn't know they were this eager. If you try to send founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg a message on Facebook, Mashable discovered Thursday, the social network may offer to keep the message out of his ""Other"" Inbox — for a cool $100. In our tests from multiple accounts, it appeared to be the case that users only get this message if they're not one of Zuck's 16 million followers. That, however, could still be coincidental.  Keen Facebook observers will recognize this as a variant on the $1 pay-to-message plan that the social network has been experimenting with for months. The company indicated at the time that it would be experimenting with other prices, so it's possible we're starting to see the fruits of that.  There were sporadic reports in December of Facebook charging various people $100 for the service, but this is the first time we've seen it — and certainly the first time we've seen it applied to the founder.  The ""Other"" inbox is Facebook's dumping ground for all messages it guesses you won't want to read urgently. It's been controversial for some time, as most users are entirely unaware of its existence — and many have been known to discover messages they really wish they'd read at the time, such as job offers. SEE ALSO: 7 Bad Moves That Hurt Facebook in 2012 The $1 pay-to-message test was first announced in December, and was described by the company as a test. It allows anyone to message any other person's inbox directly for that one-time fee, whether they are friends or not. It was derided by some users as Facebook spam. (However, it is only possible to receive one such message per week.) Here's what Facebook had to say in a statement from a spokesperson: ""We are testing some extreme price points to see what works to filter spam."" Can you see a situation in which you'd pay the extreme price point of $100? Let us know in the comments. "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/flickr-photos-in-yahoo-image-searches/,Flickr Photos Now Show Up in Yahoo Image Searches,"Photos from Flickr are now showing up in Yahoo Image searches, the company announced on Thursday. Yahoo is making ""tens of millions"" of Flickr photos available, which are available for reuse and reposting. The photos are available under Flickr's Creative Commons licensing agreement. Photos not covered under Creative Commons won't be affected. Offering such images can give Yahoo a real advantage over Google and Bing, which do not offer the photos in their image searches. To use the feature, employ the left rail on the Yahoo Image Search page and click the ""Labeled for Reuse"" option.  The move comes after Yahoo upgraded the Flickr mobile app last month with Twitter integration. The app was released almost at the same exact time that Instagram — now a unit of Facebook — began disabling support for Twitter Cards.  Flickr, which was bought by Yahoo in 2005, has been a prime area of focus for Marissa Mayer, who became Yahoo's CEO in June. Shortly after Mayer began, the Internet petitioned her to ""Make Flickr awesome again."" Yahoo responded by thanking the Internet and soliciting suggestions for making the photo-sharing site ""awesomer.""  Image courtesy of Flickr, Poolie "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/friends-dating-website/,New Dating Sites Let You Meet People Through Friends,"Imagine if you could get the same experience of a cocktail party — and all the potential date option, but online.  That's the idea behind a new crop of dating websites that aim to recreate the experience of cocktail parties or a get together at a friend's apartment where you just might meet someone new. Parties are always great places to meet people, but since most people don't have the opportunity or time to attend one every day, websites like Friendlylook, TheDatable and Circl.es let you browse your friends' friends.  The newest site Friendlylook says it engineers serendipity. The idea behind the site is that you join, mingle with new people, make friends and meet their connections. You can also have a bunch of friends join to meet new people and scour others' connections to find a potential love match for you or themselves. With Friendlylook, users have the ability to create private social events to meet people in real life. And the site is free for members.  Members can set a search parameter of two-four degrees away from them to meet strangers. But even among friends of friends, users cannot see who or specifically how they connect to any of their friends. And just like a real-life cocktail party, if you find a potential match you can ask your friends' opinions of the prospect.  SEE ALSO: Dating Website 'High Season' Means More Fish in the Sea Members also have a ""singles stream,"" that is kind of like a Facebook News Feed. The only people who show-up in the stream are ones who match a user's search criteria (age range, distance, education, etc.). The stream is very basic at the moment, but the idea has potential.  If you want to reach out to someone on the site, all communication is free. If you're the bold type, you can broadcast updates that go to everyone who meets your criteria on the site.  Currently, the team behind Friendlylook is seeking funds on Indiegogo, the crowd-funding platform, in order to build more features.  Trevor Chidester, founder of Friendlylook, says the difference between his site and traditional dating websites is that rather than go through as many dates as possible, on Friendylook people are able to identify potential matches who are more suitable for them. The ol' quality over quantity reasoning.  Circl.es and TheDatable have similar ideas — except with these sites you actually connect with Facebook to see friends of your friends.  TheDatable is kind of like a social experiment. You create a private account on TheDatable and then sign into Facebook through the site. Tag your single friends who you consider ""datable"" — as a sign of approval for other people to date, and then they tag their ""datable"" friends. The free service aims to create a network of singles.  With Circl.es, singles sign-in using their Facebook accounts and browse through all of your friends' friends. Since your profile information is already there, it doesn't take long to get started. Potential dates don't see your entire profile, just some select information from which they can select ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""skip."" If you click ""yes"" the potential match is notified and then you can see each other's profiles. To avoid endless online flirting with no action, once you've both said ""yes"" to chatting with each other on Circl.es, you have two weeks to communicate.  Have you ever used a dating site in which you find connections through friends? What was your experience? Tell us in the comments.  Photo courtesy of iStockphoto, mayakova  "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/gmail-compose/,10 Pros and Cons of Gmail's New Compose Feature,"Gmail rolled out its new Compose feature in October, allowing users the option of a cleaner, more efficient format. Some users rejoiced, while others found the changes difficult to use. Thankfully, Gmail hasn't made the new feature mandatory; you can order your email in whichever flavor you choose. So, which will it be?  Click to expand. If you're trying to juggle multiple discussions, or copy text from one email to another, having multiple drafts is incredibly convenient. Drafts can sit right next to each other on on your Gmail screen, or you can choose to pop them out for easier resizing.  If you are working on draft over time, for example, to maintain a casual list of dinner recommendations to send friends, Gmail's new feature makes it easier to put tasks on the back burner. Users can now minimize drafts to the bottom or their Gmail windows, similar to how Gchat conversations already function. Emails in process that you need to put on hold can sit on your screen until you end your session, making it harder to forget about your unfinished emails while still keeping your day organized. If you wish to search for something while composing an email, Compose won't interrupt the draft you're working on. You can also check and respond to more pressing emails while keeping your original draft intact. This definitely makes Gmail's web client more competitive with email programs like Outlook, in which multitasking can hinder productivity.  Click to expand. Compose mode features a much more streamlined email interface. Gone is the top row of buttons. Most of the options you'll need are nested next to the send button on the bottom-left corner, accessible based on priority. The result is a cleaner interface for your message. Don't like change? One of the best features is that you can easily return to the old interface by clicking on the small arrow in the right corner of the emails and select ""switch back to old compose."" It's not for everyone, and there are lots of reasons to stick to the old Gmail formula.  Click to expand. While the clean, minimalist format for Gmail's new Compose is nice, tools like changing your font seem buried. You'll find that it takes a little longer to access the tools you need. And you'll be disappointed if you're an active user of canned responses (buried in the additional options) or emoticons (not in the new Compose). This format is meant to hide the bells and whistles.  Click to expand. In that vein, the CC and BCC fields are much harder to access. It's easy to overlook them, tucked in the far left corner. The option to edit your email's subject is now buried unexpectedly under your reply or forward options. We all appreciate a distraction-free environment when writing. Opening a new email in the old mode brings up that large blank canvas we're all used to, and it can definitely curb urges to look at your other incoming emails while writing.  If you use Gchat regularly and have activated right-hand chat — a popular app for those who want to reduce clutter — you'll be disappointed by the new Compose. New emails cover the entire chat column. The one thing new Compose doesn't clean up is the bottom of your Gmail window. If you are a heavy chat user, you'll soon find that you have many chats and emails all vying for space, it might be easy to lose one if you have too many windows open. Have you switched to Gmail's new Compose? Why or why not? Please share your own pros and cons in the comments. Thumbnail image courtesy of Wilson Afonso, Flickr. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/google-map-bank-robbery/,"FBI Posts Google Map of Bank Robbery Pics, Tips","The FBI has begun collecting tips on the names of unidentifiable bank robbery suspects through a new Google map that pictures heists nationwide, bureau officials announced this week. The new site, bankrobbers.fbi.gov, shows visitors the location of incidents down to the street level, as well as the traditional Wanted poster photos and physical descriptions. Users can search by location, weapon used and the unidentified robber’s nickname, among other clues, to help authorities ascribe names to faces.  The site is intended to protect citizens from gun violence, not just financial losses, FBI officials said in a statement.  ""Many bank robberies are committed using verbal demands or notes; however, the use of weapons and threats of violence are also common,"" they said. According to FBI statistics, 49 bank robberies occurred in Washington, D.C., and Northern Virginia during 2012. That marks a new low for the bureau, which tallied 80 raids in 2011. Last year’s count was the lowest in more than a decade. While the bureau has hard figures on nationwide bank robberies, other crimes are harder for the feds to count. FBI statistics do not measure cybercrimes and other offenses that have arisen since reporting began in 1930. Late last year, Justice Department officials convened the first meeting in more than 80 years to decide on the best crime labels and incident characteristics to track. Tweets during the meeting indicate cops want crime statistics to better illustrate quality of life at the local level: ""Commissioner Ramsey: 'crime data must tell a story about community safety,'"" Deputy Assistant Attorney General James Burch typed, referencing comments by Philadelphia Police Department Commissioner Charles Ramsey.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/indiegogo-crowdfunding-2012/,A Look Back at Indiegogo's Successful Year in Crowdfunding,"Global crowdfunding platform Indiegogo released statistics about its work in 2012 last week, focusing on campaigning, community and the influence of video within the past year. The stats show that on average, campaigns raised more than 2011 campaigns did, and nearly half of all campaigns received support from more than one country. Many people know of Indiegogo as the platform used for more than 100,000 cause-related, creative or entrepreneurial campaigns, including raising money for bullied bus monitor Karen Klein, victims and families of the Sikh temple shooting, Hurricane Sandy relief and a Nikola Tesla museum. SEE ALSO: Indiegogo Expands International Crowdfunding Features
 “Indiegogo empowers people all over the world to raise money for whatever they’re passionate about,"" Danae Ringelmann, co-founder of Indiegogo, told Mashable. ""Education is a huge component of empowerment, which is why we publish our Insights series. There's no one way to have a successful campaign in 2013, but having a high ""gogofactor"" [the algorithm that measures campaign and community activity] means your campaign is thriving."" Indiegogo regularly shares insights, tips and tricks with its users to help them create better and more successful campaigns. ""It’s exciting to see that our 2012 data shows our customers are listening,"" Ringelmann said. Here are Indiegogo's 2012 highlights: Campaigns appear to have garnered more support in 2012, raising an average of 20% more than projects did in 2011. Successful campaigns took an average of 11 days to prepare for their launches. The most successful campaign, ""Let's Build a Goddamn Tesla Museum,"" raised an Indiegogo record of $1,370,461 in total funding. Indiegogo campaigns also seem to have had shorter funding periods in 2012 — core campaigns ran an average of 49 days, as opposed to 60 in 2011, and successful campaigns ran for an average of 39 days. In addition to more money raised, the generosity of the Indiegogo community seems to have increased in 2012, too, with 33% of all contributed dollars deemed ""altruistic"" dollars (contributed in excess of perk amount or without any perk). This is compared with 23% in 2011. Surprisingly, 14% of campaigns had a single contributor refer more people to the campaign page than the campaign owner. Campaigns had an average of 1.7 team members, whereas 2011 campaigns had an average of 2.2 team members. In July 2012, co-founder Slava Rubin told Mashable that if a campaign has four or more people on its team, it will raise 70% more money than a crew of one. Through Indiegogo, 45% of campaigns received contributions from people in more than one country (57% of successful campaigns). Campaigns received an average of 42 more likes or shares on Facebook than they did in 2011. Indiegogo campaigns with videos will raise 114% more money than those without, and 64% of core campaigns included videos in 2012. Campaigns with videos less than five minutes long were 25% more likely to reach their goal than those with longer videos. The average length for a campaign video was three minutes and 27 seconds in 2012. Successful campaigns had an average video length of three minutes and 11 seconds. Core campaigns uploaded an average of six pieces of media to their galleries in 2012, as compared to five in 2011.  Indiegogo also compiled several lists of notable campaigns throughout the year: Top Campaigns: The most successful campaigns based on the ""gogofactor"" algorithm, including the Tesla museum, the Karen Klein campaign and BugASalt, a salt-shooting gun to kill flies. Pitch Videos: The strongest, most inspiring or funniest Indiegogo pitch videos, including Good Spread Peanut Butter, Who Gives a Crap toilet paper and the film Por las Plumas. Perks: The best tangible items given in exchange for contributions, including the BugASalt gun, an Edison bumper sticker and the 1:Face Watch. Entrepreneurial: The best in food, small business, sports and technology, including the Who Gives a Crap toilet paper, Uwingu space exploration funding and the Yellow Jacket stun gun iPhone case. Creative: The best in art, comics, dance, design, fashion, film, gaming, music, photography, theater, transmedia, video/web and writing. The list includes the Resurrect ADOM development campaign, BugASalt and a documentary about poet and activist Alice Walker.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/minecraft-server-lobby/,Coders Combine 70 'Minecraft' Servers Into Massive Online Game,"Redditor HighlifeTTU shared a photo album with r/Minecraft on Friday that details a massive custom overhaul to the online version of the popular building game. The goal: to unify 70 servers into one enormous game space. Here's why this is kind of a big deal. Multiplayer Minecraft worlds are not served from a central location. Any player can host one, on his local machine or a dedicated server. Other players must know your server's address to join the world. Thousands of public servers are listed on community forums and other gathering places. Every server is different, depending on who's in charge — different rules, game modes, communities. Popular servers fill up, preventing others from joining. HighlifeTTU and his fellow coders have modified the server software to connect multiple worlds to a central ""lobby"" (pictured above). Rather than trying to connect ""manually"" to a list of server strings, players can jump into the lobby and join whatever world they please by walking through a portal. This could prevent overcrowding in popular servers and allow players to move seamlessly between them. There's definitely a big convenience factor there, but more compelling is the gameplay potential. World builders could theoretically connect multiple maps together (an ""overworld"" map leads to a ""town"" map or a ""dungeon"" map through server portals), uniting thousands of players in a much larger ""universe"" — essentially, a Minecraft massively multiplayer online game (MMO), akin to World of Warcraft and EVE Online. Mojang, the indie studio behind the wildly successful game, has always encouraged player-made modifications (""mods""), even incorporating some into the official product. It will be interesting to see where a server infrastructure project like this goes. It's all rather technical, so check out the Imgur gallery for a granular breakdown of how the server unification works, and the original mods it's built on. Image courtesy reddit, HighlifeTTU "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/moonshine-black-market-craigslist/,Is it 1925 Again? Florida Man Arrested for Selling Moonshine on Black Market,"A Florida man was arrested yesterday for allegedly selling over 40 gallons of moonshine to undercover state beverage agents. The Florida Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco posted a fake Craigslist ad, pretending to be someone ""looking for some strong moonshine."" A middleman contacted the agents and referred them to 23-year-old Daniel David Pawa, a Lantana resident. Over the course of several months, Pawa sold over 40 gallons of moonshine to undercover agents.  The operation came to a close on Thursday when state agents arrested Pawa and seized his .45-caliber firearm and a grenade. Pawa faces a bevy of charges including possession of moonshine, conspiracy to violate beverage laws, and possession of a firearm, the latter of which carries a maximum of 15 years in prison. In an exciting exclusive, The Jane Dough was able to get into contact with a member of the police force that arrested Pawa. What follows is Detective Pam Sarlowe's account of Thursday's events, in his own words: I had just left some dame's joint when I got a call from the big man — turned out there was a case that the coppers wanted my help with. I had sworn that messy business off years ago but it was a dark night in January, I was out of hooch, and the city was coated with a weak rain like some Crazy Daisy sprinkler had jammed up and none of the angels in heaven wanted to play anymore; in short, it was the kind of night that made you want to dive down into something deep and dark. I hoofed it to the old clubhouse and found the Lieutenant just as I had left him: looking like a tea kettle someone had left on top of a fire for too long. He gave me the casefile and a stare colder than my dead wife's corpse. ""Keep it by the book this time, Sarlowe,"" he yelled, his fat finger in my face. ""Don't go flying off all half-cocked!"" ""Don't worry Lieutenant; everything is copacetic."" Yeah, yeah, I knew what I had to do, but it's easier said than done, like every good thing is in this stinking sewage line we call Lantana. I have seen crime and it has winked back at me like some real hootchie-cootchie type broad, the kind that cries when you tell her you're leaving but plunges a knife in your back before you're even out the door. Yeah, I have known crime as intimately as I have known those kinds of broads and I have the Swiss cheese back to prove it. It didn't take me long to find the poor sucker, a chump who wouldn't stop flipping his yap about the 'shine. He looked like a boozehound and was sitting in a grade-A dump that even the darkest shadows that haunt me wouldn't be caught dead in. Dead — like my dead wife. I considered pumping some lead into the weasel, putting him out of his misery, but in the end, I decided to leave him to the Big House. I didn't need anymore blood on my hands — the color red doesn't suit me and I was all out of soap. I told the chump he was going to the slammer and I started to laugh. His future and my past were one and the same: an expansive black hole that is like the bed of a bad broad, the chamber of a gun, and the mouth of a serpent telling you to take a bite of a city that is rotten to the core. An apple a day doesn't keep shit away. Before the other men in blue knocked down the door to take ol' Johnny, I handed him a quarter, told him he could keep it, and said good luck. I was done playing games with chance; like I told you, it's a messy business.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/parents-snapchat/,A Parent's Take on Snapchat,"And now for the self-destructing text … maybe. Over the last few weeks there has been a lot of chatter about Snapchat, a very cool smartphone app that allows you to ""chat"" with friends via photos and now video. The idea is that you capture a ""selfie"" — or short video clip — using your phone’s front-facing camera, and then add a text caption or even a little artwork before sending it text-style to all your BFFs. The popularity of the service was confirmed late last year when it was revealed that Snapchat had met the two accepted standards for success in today’s app-crazed world: regular server outages caused by too much traffic and an offer to acquire the service by Facebook. (Undeterred by the Snapchat founders’ refusal to sell, Facebook went ahead and launched its own Snapchat clone called Poke.) SEE ALSO: Is Snapchat the Next Frontier for Marketers?
 As well as offering the ability to add photos and videos to texts –- a huge hit amongst its target demographic of tweens and teens –- Snapchat has one other advantage: the messages self-delete after they have been viewed. That’s right: the sender can select a duration –- anything from 1 to 10 seconds –- after which the image, along with any added text or artwork, will self-destruct. Of course, it didn’t take concerned parents too long to point out that such a service was perfect for ""sexting"" -– the unofficial practice of sending nude or sexually suggestive images via smartphones and other mobile devices. What better excuse for inappropriate behavior among oversexed teens, they argued, than a photo app that immediately destroys the evidence? Unfortunately, kids who are determined to indulge in risky behavior hardly need Snapchat to achieve their goals. Ever since we started putting powerful digital cameras in immature hands, we have run the risk of our kids getting themselves into trouble. The safeguards haven’t changed: Talk to your kids so they understand the risks, and monitor their behavior so you can intervene before that risk becomes a serious problem. And when you talk to your kids about Snapchat, Poke and similar messaging apps, you might want to point out that there is really no such thing as a self-deleting text. Snapchat recognizes just one of the ways in which its texts can live on by alerting the sender if the recipient takes a screenshot. “What?” I hear you ask. “What’s the point of a self-deleting texting service if the person receiving the text can take a screenshot?” Exactly. Snapchat has no way to disable the recipient’s ability to take that screenshot, so all it can do is warn the sender when it happens. Add to that the ability of the recipient to use another smartphone or camera to capture a screenshot and that self-deleting feature doesn’t look quite so clever after all. SEE ALSO: Photo-Messaging App 'Snapchat' Launches on Android
 Snapchat founder Evan Spiegel has been quoted as saying that the app was never intended for complete privacy — something that's borne out by a look at the company’s Terms of Service: “Although we attempt to delete image data as soon as possible after the message is transmitted, we cannot guarantee that the message contents will be deleted in every case.” Again, so much for self-delete. Snapchat is a brilliant app that provides a novel and fun way for people to liven up those dreary texts. But let’s not kid ourselves –- or our kids –- that we’ve suddenly found a way to erase our digital footprints. This post is part of a series on the digital dilemmas of raising digital kids.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/pebble-hands-on/,"Hands On With Pebble, the Internet's Favorite Smart Watch","Music controls on Pebble are intuitive and easy to use. Scrolling through email is as simple as pressing the down button on the side of the watch. Pebble has a number of unique watch faces available. This Fuzzy Time watch face spells the time out for you.  You can select between a number of watch faces, including this clock face. The Pebble is charged using a magnetic charger similar to the magnetic power connectors on MacBooks. There are a number of different colored Pebble watch faces and bands, including an all white and all black model The Kickstarter edition of the watch has ""Kickstarter Editon"" on the back of the watch face. LAS VEGAS –- Pebble, the company that raised almost 8 million to create an e-ink smart watch, announced at CES this week that it will start shipping the watch to its Kickstarter backers on Jan. 23. We caught up with Pebble’s creator, Eric Migicovsky, at the show to give the smart watch a try. Migicovsky told us that Pebble chose CES to make the shipment announcement because a tremendous percentage of the project’s backers would be in attendance.  Though absent from the show floor, Pebble had a suite at the Venetian Hotel set up, and it invited Kickstarter backers to stop by and give the watch a spin. It’s going to take the company six to eight weeks to get units out to everyone who took part in funding via Kickstarter. That means that while some backers will have watches in late January, others will be waiting until almost April. CES was show full of smart watches made by a number of different companies. The most notable examples include Italian-born I’m watch and, another Kickstarter project, Martian.  Pebble is the only smart watch out there using an e-ink display. Having handled the competition this week, I can say that it’s a ton lighter than the other options, something you’re definitely going to appreciate when it comes to wearing it on your wrist all day. Power is going to be another area where the Pebble stands out. Migicovsky says that the Pebble can keep kicking for seven days on a single charge, with the watch only needing a few hours to charge up completely.  Pebble charges using a unique magnetic charger that snaps onto the watch's side, a bit different than its competition, which charges using microUSB. As far as apps are concerned, Pebble currently only has custom watch faces. However, it's expected to have a number of apps soon. Notably, RunKeeper announced that it would be available on the watch earlier this year. The screen on Pebble is not controlled by touch, but is instead navigated using the buttons on the side of the device. The button on the right side of the watch serves as a back button, with up, enter and down buttons positioned on the left side of the watch face. Navigating through menus was a breeze, and I was able to accept a call, text, and read email pretty effectively as well. So, are smart watches ready for prime time? It certainly looks like Pebble is. We’re going to have one of Pebble’s smart watches in our office soon. Stay tuned for a full review in the coming weeks. What do you think of Pebble’s smart watch?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/project-shield-hands-on/,"Hands On With Project Shield, Nvidia's Powerhouse Game Controller","Project Shield will be one of the first devices to pack Nvidia's Tegra 4 processor. Designed to be both a standalone Android gaming device as well as a bridge for your PC games, the Shield is due to launch in the spring. LAS VEGAS — One of the big surprises of CES 2013 was Project Shield, a handheld game controller that Nvidia unveiled in dramatic fashion earlier this week. We got a little hands-on time with a pre-production model of the device, which the company hopes to transform into a full-fledged gaming platform, while at the show. The Shield certainly seems to have the goods to do what Nvidia promises. Powered by the just-officially-unveiled Tegra 4 processor, it ably handled some taxing Android games and relayed graphics-intensive PC games to an HDTV with just a couple of button pushes. Picking it up for the first time, I could tell Project Shield was something special. It feels solid in the hand, although heavier than your average Xbox controller. Gameplay buttons are where you expect them, and the array in the middle, which includes the big button that toggles between Android and your PC/media hub, is clearly labeled. When I flipped open the lid to reveal the 5-inch 720p touch screen, the display came on almost instantly. It's eye-poppingly bright and sharp, exactly what I'd expect from an OLED display. Gameplay screens look good, but for the kinds of games the Shield was made to play — graphics-intensive titles with lots of action — it feels a little small. Good thing, then, that the Shield can mirror the action to a big screen easily, either via wired or wireless (dual band, 2x2 MIMO) connection. Nvidia only had a wired connection available, so naturally the game played flawlessly, with no lag that I could detect.  The real test was seeing how Project Shield handled moving PC content to a TV. Toggling to the PC/media gateway, I cued up Hawken. Here's where the Shield works as a kind of relay, starting up and then pulling the content from the PC and rendering it both on the Shield's screen and the TV. It's said to support resolutions up to 4K. The linkup worked fine, although it required some creative button pushing to finish starting up the game. PC games don't all necessarily start in the same way, so Nvidia may need to polish this slightly before general release. Once Hawken was running, however, everything was smooth. Shield seemed to relay every pixel of the graphics-intensive game with ease. It didn't even get warm. Would it have if the graphics were 4K and I played for hours instead of minutes? Probably. But the fact that there's a device that can even move that many pixels among three devices, wired or wireless, is astonishing. Based on my time with Project Shield, I think the gaming crowd will be pleased. It adds tactile controls to Android games and opens a whole new dimension to anything on a PC. And let's not forget that it's also a Jelly Bean-powered Android device, so you have email, web browsing and apps when you want them. I think there's little question Project Shield will be on many gamers' wish lists when it becomes available (planned for the spring). The big question now is how much Nvidia will charge for it. You tell us: How much would you pay for Project Shield? Let us know in the comments. Powerful yet fun DIY robotics for adults and children.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/reuters-pulls-iphone-mini/,Why Did Reuters Pull its iPhone Mini Report?,"Late Thursday, a report from the Shanghai Evening News suggested Apple would not be producing a less expensive iPhone despite reports to the contrary. That story, and what happened after its publication, is shaping up to be one of the most bizarre technology stories in recent memory. According to the report, Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller stated that his company would not be developing ""cheap smartphones."" Based on those comments, Reuters ran an article with the headline, ""Apple exec dismisses iPhone as a market share grab — report."" On Friday, Reuter pulled their original story after ""substantial changes to its content"" were made to the Shanghai Evening News report. In doing so, Reuters said ""no replacement story will be issued."" AppAdvice, and others, have no idea what ""substantial changes"" were made to that first story. All that remains of it is the unedited version hosted at jfdaily.com. It was clear on Thursday that many news outlets were concerned as to the accuracy of the Shanghai Evening News report. After all, its content went against reporting done earlier in the week by the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg that said a less expensive iPhone was coming. Although The Next Web received confirmation from Apple that the comments attributed to Schiller were correct. This latest development only adds some more confusion to the situation. Our best bet is that Schiller’s comments were correct, but perhaps taken out of context. Having read those comments in print, Apple likely sounded the alarm, which leads us to where we are at this moment: confusion. Image courtesy of Flickr, yum9me

Over 260 million active users for our games means one thing: We're not stopping here! Thanks everyone! #quarterofabillion — Rovio Entertainment (@RovioHQ) January 11, 2013 Although Rovio didn't expand on the statement, the figure likely refers to monthly active users, the industry standard. At the Mipcom conference in Cannes, France, back in October, EVP Andrew Stalbow announced that the Angry Birds games had 200 million monthly users. Stabow added, ""In any given day, we have 20 to 30 million people playing our games connected."" Zynga, meanwhile, claimed 306 million active users around the same time.  Though Rovio has had trouble expanding beyond Angry Birds, the three-year-old franchise keeps on giving. In November, the company introduced yet another Birds title, Angry Birds Star Wars. An Angry Birds movie also is set for 2016. Image courtesy of iStockphoto, Robas "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/rubiks-cube-braille/,Here's a Rubik's Cube for the Blind,"Remember the Rubik's Cube? Of course you do. Invented in 1974 and sold non-stop from 1980 onward, the fiendishly difficult six-faced puzzle has fascinated the planet for generations. It is widely regarded as the best-selling toy in the world, shipping more than 350 million units. There's even a touchscreen version. But there has always been one group unable to enjoy it — until now.  ""My buddy is blind. I want to get him a Rubik’s Cube, but I don’t really have the skills to make this kind of thing."" So wrote Lauren, a user of the website Custom Made, which connects the unusual desires of its customers with makers looking for a challenge.  The maker who stepped up to the plate in this instance was Tom Stringham of Emerald Models Inc., a company that has built projects for the New York State School for the Blind. Stringham tells the story of building the cube on the Custom Made blog.  The result is what you can see above: a cube with nine clear acrylic plastic molds on each side. Each one of the molds bears the contours of a distinct shape — crosses, triangles, squares, circles, stars and lines.  The braille-like cubes aren't for sale commercially, but you can get one custom-made here. Stringham's suggested price is $100.  Image courtesy of CustomMade "

Snooki says she wanted her headphones line to be fun and fashionable. Snooki also launched assorted accessories, including a shoe-shaped, bedazzled phone. Snooki says she is a big fan of social media, especially Twitter and Instagram. LAS VEGAS — Say what you want about Snooki, but she attracted among the most hype and commotion at 2013 International CES conference this week while promoting the launch of her new headphones line. Based on the amount of buzz around her arrival, you'd never guess President Bill Clinton had spoken nearby to attendees just a few hours earlier.  Swarms of people flocked on Wednesday to see the tiny reality TV star model on the show floor her sparkled and cheetah-printed headphones and quirky tech accessories, including earbuds that look like earrings. Called Snooki Couture by Nicole Polizzi, which is manufactured by iHip, she says she wants to bring funky clip-on fashion to the audio industry. ""My line features accessories you can clip on to headphones, so you can change them as much as you want,"" Polizzi told Mashable. ""I wanted my headphones to be like me — fun and fashionable — and something I would definitely wear. I love bows, feathers and cheetah print, so I made sure to include them."" Snooki, who says she was very involved in the design process, joins a long line of celebrities who introduced headphones and earbuds at the tech conference this year, including Tim Tebow, Nick Cannon and Ro Marley Not to mention New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees is the new brand ambassador for a pair of Monster earbuds.  SEE ALSO: Tim Tebow Launches Headphones, Including 'Jet' Model
 The celebrity-headphone trend has been fueled by the popularity of Beats by Dr. Dre headphones over the years. Monster, the first company behind the Beats product, said earlier this week that clip-on headbands for headphones are something it's already working on for the future. (Is Snooki on to a larger trend?) The company showed prototypes of spiked and feathered headbands during its new product launch event on Monday.  Although Snooki may have wrapped the final season of The Jersey Shore, she can still be heard quite often online, thanks to her very active social media presence: ""I absolutely love social media,"" she said. ""During Hurricane Sandy, we were without electricity for a week and I couldn't tweet, Instagram or do anything. I wanted to kill myself; it was so awful."" Snooki said becoming a new mom has made her more of ""an Instagram freak"" in recent weeks: ""I take way more pictures of my son Lorenzo than I do myself now,"" she said. ""I love it.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/sony-coo-4k-content/,Sony Exec Explains How 4K TV Owners Will Get Content,"LAS VEGAS — If there was a trend at CES 2013, it was 4K. Every major TV manufacturer announced at least one TV with 4K resolution, and some unveiled several. Not many addressed the main issue with the new ""Ultra HD"" format, however: the lack of content. Sony was one of the few who did, and the company's chief operating officer, Phil Molyneux, told Mashable in an interview how customers of its 4K TVs will be able to get content in native 4K. ""We wanted to deliver a native 4K experience,"" Molyneux says, ""so we put together a media server, and we worked with Sony Pictures, and we remastered 10 titles into 4K. We loaded them onto the server, and we loan that server to the customer so they've got that real experience."" The 4K server ships with Sony's only 4K TV available right now, the 84-inch model, and Molyneux didn't say whether it would also be packaged with the 65- or 55-inch sets the company unveiled at CES. It'll probably get boring to watch the same 10 4K titles, though, so Sony plans to send out regular updates with more content. The first is due in February. These won't be downloaded — Sony will actually hand-deliver a ""memory device"" to owners of the 84-inch TV via its white-glove service. But as Molyneux announced at Sony's press conference, downloads are in the works. ""What we're focusing on this summer, in the U.S. only, is this download service, so owners of all of our 4K TVs will be able to download content remotely to a server device,"" he says. Will customers be able to download only Sony movies, however? Molyneux says the project is in early stages so other studios haven't yet had the chance to sign up. But broad 4K support from Hollywood and others is the goal with the service. ""What I believe will happen is that there is now great momentum, that consumers are embracing 4K because it's such a thrilling experience, and I believe other studios will get on board,"" Molyneux says. ""But there are other content creators outside of Hollywood who are producing great 4K content, many of them using our 4K cameras."" How do you like Sony's plans to deliver 4K?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/sorry-vader-white-house-death-star/,"Sorry, Vader, White House Won't Build a Death Star","In a memo titled ""This Isn't the Petition Response You're Looking For,"" the Obama White House formally (and finally!) responded Friday to a petition asking to secure the resources to begin construction on a Death Star by 2016. Sorry, Dark Side supporters, but the administration's view is clear: it ""does not support blowing up planets."" As we, and the White House, know, the real cost of building a Death Star is so high it has 15 zeroes attached, and, for practicality's sake alone, that's one project that will not be getting the green light this year. But — that's not all! Cheekiness aside, the White House used this petition response as an opportunity to remind us of all the great space programs that are currently underway. There's the International Space Station, robots on Mars, telescopes discovering new planets, and prospects of manned missions to the Moon this decade — exciting times, no matter which side of the Force you're on. SEE ALSO: Mr. President, Build This Death Star
 The greatest lesson, though, comes at the close of the memo: ""If you do pursue a career in a science, technology, engineering or math-related field, the Force will be with us! Remember, the Death Star's power to destroy a planet, or even a whole star system, is insignificant next to the power of the Force."" Take heed, future Jedis of America, and get studying!

http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/startup-drones-medical-supplies/,Startup Wants to Use Drones to Deliver Medical Supplies," Drones can be deadly. They're used in Afghanistan, Pakistan and elsewhere to spy and take out suspected terrorists. But drones can be good too. We've already seen that their potential extends beyond the battlefield. And other than delivering burritos, they can be used for humanitarian reasons as well, like delivering medical supplies to hard-to-reach areas. That's the goal of a Palo Alto startup called Matternet, that wants to build a network of unmanned aerial vehicles to bring medicines and other important supplies in countries where some communities live in areas not served by usable roads.  ""Imagine if we can deliver the medicine within hours or even minutes with a small autonomous flying device,"" said Matternet CEO and founder Andreas Raptopoulos at last year’s PopTech conference, ""The key here is the autonomy of the solution, there are no humans involved."" In places like Haiti or Lesotho, in Africa, large parts of the population live in areas that are not served by usable roads, isolated from cities and essential infrastructures like hospitals. Building roads so that trucks can reach them can be expensive. Why not use small, flying robots to bring them what they need? The idea is to create a network of base stations to blanket an area and then use GPS-guided drones to fly around and deliver the supplies. SEE ALSO: Google Grant Helps WWF Fight Poachers With Drones
 According to a case study Matternet did last year, building 50 base stations equipped with 150 drones would cost $900,000. Each flight would cost $0.24. The startup has conducted trials in the Dominican Republic and in Haiti, where it used drones to to deliver supplies in Haiti last year.  Although this network of drones sounds great on paper, there are numerous challenges to actually deploy it effectively. Cost is the first. Even though the drones are autonomous, Matternet will probably need to put personnel in the base stations to load the drones and make sure everything is running smoothly. And there are safety issues, too. The UAVs will sometimes fly in areas where aircrafts or helicopters fly as well, so there needs to be a system to avoid collisions.  To know more about this project, check out the video above. UPDATE:  An earlier version of this article mistakenly stated that Matternet had conducted trials in Lesotho. In actuality, the only tests the startup has carried out have been in Haiti and the Dominican Republic.   Image courtesy of Vimeo "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/students-program-space-station-satellites/,Space Station Contest Lets Students Program Satellites,"After controlling small satellites in the International Space Station on Friday morning, two teams of high school students took home top prizes for their programming skills. The teams were part of the Zero Robotics SPHERES Challenge, an annual competition that asks students to program bowling ball-size satellites to perform maneuvers related to current space-exploration problems. This year's competitors had to mimic cleaning up broken satellites and other unwanted debris humans have put into orbit around the Earth, but haven't brought back down again. Such ""space junk"" increases every year, which is a problem for new satellites that people want to put into space. The student-written programs run in real testing satellites, called Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient Experimental Satellites, or SPHERES, that zip around the cabin of the International Space Station. Every year, winners are announced among U.S. and European Union teams. In the United States, the winning team included students from Montclair High School in New Jersey and the Evergreen School District in Washington State. In the EU, the top prize went to a team of students from the Enrico Fermi School in Italy and Herder-Gymnasium in Germany. Image courtesy of Flickr, sam_churchill

An embedded ECG sensor in the rear of the watch lets it recognize its owner’s unique pulse patterns, and will shut down the watch’s smart functions if an impostor tries to put it on.  Able to connect to both iPhones and Android devices, the watch displays alerts for incoming calls, emails, and calendar events. Its display can be used for navigation, or to display the latest news and weather information. The watch’s high-resolution OLED display has sensors built-in that optimize for brightness and viewing angle, so you’ll always be able to see what’s on the screen. Currently in prototype form, the smart watch is just a glimpse at the kind of tech that we could see coming to our wrists in the future.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/trackingpoint-rifle/,TrackingPoint Is World's First Smart Hunting Rifle,"LAS VEGAS — The world's first-ever smart hunting rifle will help users never again miss their targets. With video streaming technology, an integrated wireless hot spot and even an app, the TrackingPoint rifle was on display at the 2013 International CES conference this week. It's billed as the most accurate long-range shooting system in the world, and its mission is to give both amateur and expert hunters real-time data to shoot with precision.  The rifle will be available for purchase in the near future, but no date was specified at the conference. The launch is untimely in light of recent gun-related tragedies and it's unclear whether this will affect the product's public reception. The firearm — which is priced at $20,000 and comes with an iPad mini — displays for shooters a video-game-like map of a prey's location, based on imagery transmitted back from the rifle's scope. The software recognizes the animal the hunter is aiming at and paints a target on it. The hunter lines up the virtual cross hairs line up with the target. However, if the rifle's aim doesn't match the painted location, shooting capabilities will lock. The software also provides data on wind, temperature and distance to target.  ""We want to teach people about ethical shooting,"" a spokesperson told Mashable. ""Some people playing hunting-inspired video games will want to shoot animals in the butt, but that is not the way you hit a target and it also causes suffering for the animal. The app and the rifle won't let you do that."" SEE ALSO: Facebook Charging $100 to Message Mark Zuckerberg
 The accompanying iPad Mini and the TrackingPoint app (iOS) are intended for those who hunt in pairs. For example, one person could hold the tablet and reference the app's data and video streaming feed to help the other calibrate the rifle. When shooting alone, a hunter can use a heads-up display in the scope and see the same geo-location data. When not hunting, the app can still be used as a teaching tool and a game.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/vimensio-gives-3d-the-bird/,Vimensio Gives 3D the Bird," LAS VEGAS — 3D hasn’t quite lived up to the hype: We’re not all sitting in our living rooms, wearing special glasses and marveling at the soccer ball some player just kicked in our face. That doesn't mean, however, there's nothing useful for 3D to do. Companies like Leonar3Do are using passive 3D technology to build education products that put teachers and students inside the design process. It introduced its latest product, Vimensio, here at CES 2013. The virtual reality company's still-in-beta 3D educational system is actually comprised of multiple parts: the content and app-building environment Edit and Vimensio Play, where you interact with the virtual 3D app environment. What makes the platform cool, however, is the hardware. Known as ""Bird"" this 3D mouse lets you interact with the virtual world (as long as you’re wearing the passive 3D glasses). The spikey-looking, hand-held mouse (which looks nothing like a mouse) includes haptic feedback, which means it vibrates when you move over a virtual object or barrier. To use it, you hold the Bird in the air and move it around. Sensors affixed to the edge of the screen pick up the Bird's location and orientation in space. I gave it a test drive and found that, with a little practice, I was able to use the Bird to manipulate  and look around a 3D Jeep. The complete package costs $499. ""Leonar3Do's vision has always been to breakout of the antiquated 2D mold and drive design innovation to empower how people can visualize, create and innovate their ideas they've imagined but in real, 3D space,"" said Roland Manyai, Leonar3Do's business development and marketing director, in a release announcing the product.

The software is close to pure Android 4.1 ""Jelly Bean,"" mirroring Vizio's approach with its Windows 8 machines: Getting rid of the bloatware. The tablet (no name yet) is relatively light, noticeably less hefty than an iPad. The screen looks great, rendering retina-resolution photos with amazing clarity. Droplets on a petal of a rose, for example, had excellent texture, and you could see the details of the light reflected in each one. Have you ever had that experience on a tablet or phone of flipping too fast through photos that the screen can't keep up? Didn't happen at all on the Vizio tablet. Every pic slid in and appeared instantaneously or close to it. Videos look good, too, and, like photos, playback begins just as you tap the play button. Graphics-intensive websites load fast, on par with the iPad 4. There weren't any games or benchmarks loaded on the tablet, so I couldn't really give Vizio's 10-inch tablet a thorough workout, but we're looking forward to checking it out when it's released, scheduled for this summer (no prices yet). Preliminary specs call for 32GB of storage, a 5MP camera in back and a 1.3MP one in back, and the micro trifecta of HDMI, USB and SD card ports. The tablet doesn't have a name yet, and it's joined by a 7-inch model, which is closer to final product. That one will pack Tegra 3 and 16GB of storage as well as have a 1,280 x 800 screen. How do you like Vizio's Tegra 4-powered tablet? Let us know in the comments. This Android tablet, which Vizio plans to launch later in 2013, is one of the only devices at CES powered by Nvidia's latest and greatest mobile processor, the Tegra 4. The OS is Android 4.1 ""Jelly Bean."" The screen resolution is 2.560 x 1,600 -- comparable with the Google Nexus 10 Vizio is also launching a 7-inch design, powered by Nvidia's Tegra 3. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/11/yotaphone-2/,E-Ink on a Smartphone? This Android Phone Has 2 Displays,"You can use the rear of the YotaPhone as a clock, or to display wallpapers. YotaPhone resembles many other Android phones from the front. YotaPhone has developed a number of applications for the second screen. One application lets you know how long it's been since you've had a cigarette, and encourages you not to smoke. This screen can be displayed on the back of the YotaPhone when you take a picture. A map can be pushed to the rear of the YotaPhone and used for navigation. Particularly useful when you have a dying battery, the map will still show up on the back of the phone when your traditional screen runs out of power. The back of the phone can display your calendar or appoitments. LAS VEGAS —  What if your phone had two displays? Announced in mid-December, YotaPhone aims to change how people use their smartphones by bringing together a full-color LCD display on one side of the phone and an e-ink display on the other. I caught up with Yota Device’s Vladislav Martynov at CES to give the phone a closer look. In essence, the two displays on the handset each have their own unique purpose. The front display is used just as you might your traditional smartphone screen to run apps, browse the web or watch videos. The rear display on the YotaPhone is what makes it stand out. An electronic paper display, it shows content you push to it from the front of the device. Less for interacting with and more for reference information, you can use the display for a map to your next destination, a clock, or a place to keep the boarding pass for your flight handy.   Martynov showed me a few applications designed specifically to use with the screen as well, including an app that shows low long you’ve kept a particular goal, such as not smoking. The company plans to release an API for other developers to make applications that take advantage of the dual-screen functionality as well. Running Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, Martynov says that he plans to keep Android as vanilla as possible, something he feels is very important.  He also wants to make sure that the phone is on-par with high-end Android smartphones, spec-wise. The current iteration uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM 8960 platform, and Corning’s 3D Gorilla Glass. It’s also a multi-band LTE handset that can run on LTE networks anywhere in the world. YotaPhone is expected to go one sale during the second half of 2013.

The news was revealed to the Tech by Swartz's uncle Michael Wolf and confirmed by Swartz’s attorney, Elliot R. Peters. “The tragic and heartbreaking information you received is, regrettably, true,” said Peters.  Born in 1986, Swartz co-authored the first specification of RSS when he was 14. He also started Infogami, a service funded by Y Combinator that was later merged with social networking site Reddit.  Swartz also co-founded Demand Progress, an advocacy group that rallies people ""to take action on the news that affects them — by contacting Congress and other leaders, funding pressure tactics, and spreading the word in their own communities."" In July 2011, Swartz was arrested for allegedly harvesting 4 million academic papers from the JSTOR online journal archive. He appeared in court in Sept. 2012, pleading not guilty.  A blog post from 2007 on Swartz's website reveals a possible cause for taking his own life: depression. In the post, Swartz describes his experiences with severe depression, as well as several other health issues, including migraines. Image credit: Flickr, peretzp "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/12/apple-considering-cheap-iphone/,Turns Out Apple Might Still Be Considering a Cheap iPhone,"There's been some confusion around the rumors indicating that Apple is considering a cheaper version of the iPhone. As of today, no one really knows what's going on. So much so that even Reuters misfired, pulling a story based on comments made by Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller to a Chinese daily that appeared to debunk the rumors.  As it turns out, Schiller didn't really mean it. Or, at least, he was misquoted. On Thursday, the Shanghai Evening News ran a story with the headline: ""Apple will not push a cheaper smartphone for the sake of market share."" The piece then quoted Schiller saying Apple would not launch a cheap iPhone just for the sake of expanding its market share.  But yesterday, as reported by Reuters, the Chinese daily published a new story removing the headline and all references to cheap smartphones.  The new version leaves a door open for a low-end version of the popular Apple phone: ""Apple wants to provide the best products, will not blindly pursue market share."" The daily also added a new quote from Schiller: ""Apple has always focused on providing the best products for its consumers, we’ve never blindly chased market share."" SEE ALSO:  Cheaper iPhone Would Cost $99 to $149, Report Says
 Even if this doesn't completely clear up all the confusion around these rumors — there will always be uncertainty with a new Apple product until the official launch — it does provide some insights. The Shangai Evening News evidently misquoted or at least put Schiller's words out of context. His words seem to indicate that he wasn't specifically trying to deny the possibility of a new, cheaper iPhone, but just state that whatever Apple does, it always looks for quality over price and market share. There's nothing that hints there won't be an iPhone mini, or whatever its name will be.  The original article already raised eyebrows, as it contradicted reports by Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal that indicated that a cheaper iPhone was in the works.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/12/how-to-avoid-being-a-bad-hire/,"5 Ways to Avoid Being a Costly, Bad Hire","Sudy Bharadwaj is a founder and the CEO of Jackalope Jobs, a platform that helps job seekers find a job via their social networks. Learn how Sudy and Jackalope Jobs obsess over job seekers by connecting with them on Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. New  research shows the effects of a bad hire go beyond a minimal cost. While 41% of employers estimated the costs of a bad hire to be more than $25,000 (and 24% estimated more than $50,000), many of these employers also listed loss of productivity, lost time to recruit and train another worker, and the cost to recruit and train another worker as the main pitfalls of making a bad hire. But let’s flip our perspective for a moment and consider this: What if you are that bad hire? More importantly, as you look for your next job, how can you improve the perception to your new employer that you are not that bad, high-risk new hire? You might be hiding in a corner right now wondering what you did wrong — but don’t put all the blame on yourself. In fact, it’s partially the employer’s fault. Employers reported that much of the reason for making a bad hire included trying to fill the job too quickly, insufficient talent intelligence and failure to check references. If you’ve been fired because you just weren’t the “right fit” for a company, keep your chin up. Learn from your mistakes and the ones made by the hiring manager, and make sure your next job is a great fit for both you and your employer. The following are a few ways to avoid being a bad hire for a company. This can be a tough task. Use your networking skills and try to find out what happened with the employee you are replacing. You may need to walk a fine line between not being too nosy, but proper research should benefit you and your employer. One quote I have seen successfully used is, “I am not looking for a job, I am looking for a win, let's work together and learn from the past to get to a successful future.” This type of dialogue can certainly change the tone of your conversation with an employer. Just as the employer needs to sufficiently research you, you also need to conduct adequate research on the company. This needs to be done way before you accept the job. In fact, you should be doing this research  prior to writing the cover letter. Before you accept any job offer, take the time to truly understand the mechanics of your employer. Do a little research online: Take a look at their website, social media accounts, and any recent news. Consider these questions when doing company research: What’s the history and foundation of the company? What’s the mission and vision of the organization, and how do you fit into these goals? What is the management style in the office? What are the employer’s work expectations? Is there room for growth? Are you truly happy with the benefits provided? Employers cited 67% of their bad hires as having lackluster work. But if the candidate didn’t understand the job requirements, this may be part of the problem. Understanding the job you're accepting can help ensure you're not making a poor decision in terms of fit or skills.  Job seekers are often so enthralled in simply getting a job, they forget any job isn’t the same as the  right job. So, make sure you asked a lot of questions during your interview. If you’d like to hear more about processes, deadlines, managers or any job-related work, don’t hesitate to ask. This will give you a better sense of your day-to-day work, and if that work aligns with your skills and experience. Again, it’s easy to get overzealous about accepting any job — but being honest with your employer is vital. Lying on your resume, cover letter, references or during the interview will never work in your favor. Lies, large and small, often have a way of coming back to bite you. Be upfront about anything that the employer might need to know before you’re hired. Employers cited that 60% of their bad hires did not work well with other employees. This lack of teamwork is often due to the company culture, and if you were unaware of this culture prior to accepting the job, therein lies the problem. Always make it a point to get a sense of the company culture before accepting a job. If you don’t know enough about the culture from the website or social media accounts, ask your interviewer if you can have a quick tour of the office. Avoid being a bad hire by having some foresight before accepting any job. Your employer will thank you for it later. Have you ever been fired because you were a poor fit with the company? How do you recommend rectifying these situations in the future? The Mashable Job Board connects job-seekers across the U.S. with unique career opportunities in the digital space. While we publish a wide range of job listings, we have selected a few job opportunities from the past two weeks to help get you started. Happy hunting!

http://mashable.com/2013/01/12/im-here/,"Find Your Child, Pet or Suitcase With 'I'm Here' GPS Tracker","LAS VEGAS – The CES show floor was home to several GPS trackers this year. One of the most interesting was I’m Here, a tracker developed by the same company that created an Android smart watch called I’m Watch. Unveiled during the company’s CES press conference, I’m Here is a pint-sized tracker designed to help you keep up with everything from your suitcase to your kindergartener. The tracker works using the same technology found in cell phones. Users can find out where the device is located — whether it's in a bag or tied to a shoe — whenever they want.  If, for example, you arrive at your destination without your bag, simply ping the device to find out where it is. The I’m Here’s location is shown on a map in an accompanying app for the device. I’m Here has a high up-front cost — around $160 — but after its initial purchase, you can locate the device 200 times for free. Each additional search after the initial 200 will cost $0.05. The device can be used in any country around the world for the same price. Trakdot, a competing GPS tracker specifically for suitcases and bags, is expected to be available in March of this year for a suggested retail price of $49.95. Activating that device will cost an additional $8.99, plus an annual service fee of $12.99. Whereas Trakdot is a fairly large device, however, I’m Here is both small and colorful, making it ideal for tracking kids (by tying the device onto their shoe, for example). It's also great for finding lost valuables such as house keys or a pet.  What do you think about using devices such as I’m Here to track your kids and luggage?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/12/international-pavilion/,Things Get Weird and Wonderful at CES 2013's International Pavilion," I'm not immune to charms of giant ultra HD screens, glowing white booths filled with futuristic sports cars and celebrities sporting the latest headphones, but my favorite part of CES 2013, by far, is the back alleys — especially the tiny booths in the International Pavilion. They're kind of off the beaten path. You won't find them in the giant Central Hall, or the auto-filled North Hall or even the lower floor and tiny and quirky booths of the South Hall. No, they're a walk away in the ballrooms of the Las Vegas Hotel (formerly the Las Vegas Hilton). Inside are dozens of tiny booths full of tiny — and mostly Asian — companies peddling unusual wares. When they saw me and my cameraman arrive, one company rep actually thanked us and said, ""no one comes around here."" And that is a shame, because the products are unusual, interesting and if nothing else, colorful. It's not just the products that are different.  The International Pavilion has its quirks. Most company reps speak little-to-no English and many quote prices in Yen. Some grow nervous when you ask when the products will hit the U.S. market, asking if they can ""contact you tomorrow.""  And everywhere you look there are not only bowls of odd candys but crackers and nuts. One woman smiled broadly and encouraged me to take some nuts and all I could think about was the hundreds of other hands that had already been in that bowl of unwrapped food. Yet, even this only added to the International Pavilion's charm. Among the highlights: a tiny flying RC robot, a remote control power strip that looks more like a toilet seat, a speaker that looks like a boat, see-through keyboards and a hand-crank charger for your iPhone. So settle back and join me on a tour of CES 2013's best back alley. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/12/ipad-mini-bible-case/,Disguise Your iPad Mini with this Holy Bible Case,"LAS VEGAS — We saw quite a few eccentric items at CES this year: an iPad man, the Direct TV kangaroo starting a impromptu dance mob, and even sumo wrestlers — but one of our favorites was this iPad mini case by Japanese brand Ozaki. It looks like a Bible. Genius.  This takes the ""disguise your dirty magazine in a textbook"" idea to a whole new level. I would have appreciated it, had such tech been around during my brief stint attending catechism classes.   If the Bible isn't for you, Ozaki also has plain leather-bound cases that give the look of classic novels, and other book titles including The Old Astronomy Book, a dictionary, and even Dare to Play Your Tune, as seen above.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/12/obama-star-wars-tribute/,Obama's Death Star Response is Best Star Wars Tribute in History,"Sometimes, you just have to use a little Force. When a petition calling on the Obama Administration to begin building a Death Star by 2016 blasted past the 25,000 signatures necessary for an official response late last year, the White House could have gone any number of ways. It wasn't required to reply in a timely fashion; it could have stuck the whole thing in a drawer. The petition was obviously frivolous; it could have just said thanks, but no thanks.  But the President, a known sci-fi geek who once flashed a Vulcan salute with a Lieutenant from the Starship Enterprise, evidently opted for a third direction. The response would be written promptly, in full, with as many lovingly-chosen Star Wars references as possible pressed into the service of soaring scientific rhetoric.  Never mind giving George Lucas the National Medal of Technology, as George W. Bush did; Obama would go a step further in honoring the $4 billion franchise that won our hearts in 1977 (and was sold to Disney in 2012). He would, in effect, make sure its key phrases were read into the national record for all time.  The title of the online letter, written by Paul Shawcross at the White House Office of Management and Budget, is the first clue: ""This Isn't the Petition Response You're Looking For."" (Now repeat, in a dazed Stormtrooper voice: ""this isn't the petition response I'm looking for. You can go about your business."") After giving props to economics students from LeHigh University who calculated Death Star construction costs at some $850 quadrillion (13,000 times the Earth's GDP), the letter gives voice to a common-sense argument every moviegoer knows: ""Why would we spend countless taxpayer dollars on a Death Star with a fundamental flaw that can be exploited by a one-man starship?""  (After all, that thermal exhaust port's got to go somewhere — and there's always going to be some Rebel hotshot with his damn proton torpedoes.) SEE ALSO: Mr. President, Build This Death Star By linking to a set of instructions for viewing the ISS in the night sky, Shawcross is able to use the line ""that's no moon, it's a Space Station!"" He doesn't need to do anything with the NASA-private space industry partnership, the Commercial Crew and Cargo Program Office: its acronym is C3PO. That's a gimme.  The next paragraph laments that ""the United States doesn't have anything that can do the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs."" (Might a petition to build the Millennium Falcon meet with more success?) It also reminds us that the Voyager spacecraft are poised on the brink of interstellar space, that the galaxy is suddenly lousy with 17 billion Earth-size planets, that there's a robot on Mars wielding a laser (not to mention a scrubbing brush), and that in five short years a NASA probe will go investigate the surface of the Sun for the first time.    And if you're anywhere close to a true space nerd, this is the part that might give you a very Carl Sagan-like thrill. Hey, we really are starting to conquer the galaxy, aren't we? Lest anyone doubt who signed off on this thing, the petition response points out that Obama is handy with a lightsaber (he used one to parry with the U.S. Olympic fencing team on the South Lawn, which is surely the geekiest thing any President has done). It also can't resist pointing out that he launched a marshmallow cannon at the first ever White House science fair.  But that's just setting the stage for a Jedi-like pivot to STEM, or Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, the four kinds of education the US desperately needs to compete in the 21st century global economy. The letter closes by effectively comparing STEM to the Force — just so it can end on this: ""Remember, the Death Star's power to destroy a planet, or even a whole star system, is insignificant next to the power of the Force."" That's right. The President's administration just explained its top education policy with a Darth Vader quote.  Somewhere in Marin County, George Lucas — who gave billions of dollars from the Disney sale to his educational foundation — just cracked a shy little smile.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/12/samsung-smart-fridge-recipes/,Samsung Smart Fridge Dishes Up Recipe Ideas and Coupons," Technology has helped solve many problems for us. We make phone calls and read emails from wherever we are (most of the time) using cellphones, and record our favorite TV shows and movies to watch later.  But it hasn't helped solve the age-old dilemma of figuring out what’s for dinner — until now. Samsung showed off a smart refrigerator at the 2013 International CES that can offer recipe suggestions based on what you have in your fridge at the time. No photo magnets here — the front of the 32 cu. ft. capacity four-door fridge is adorned with a 10-inch tablet pre-loaded with apps designed to help you and your family get organized. There’s Evernote for shared grocery lists, so you can add to the list while your partner is shopping and the update will appear on their mobile device. A grocery manager helps you keep track of what’s going into the fridge  — fresh food or leftovers — and lets you set an expiration date. A note pops up on the screen letting you know what’s set to expire in a day, or however you ask it to remind you. It's perfect for those who tend to forget those Tupperware containers of leftovers in the back of the fridge. You tell the app what’s in the fridge by a simple drag-and-drop of items on the screen. Super easy to use which means you may actually use the feature. Once your food items are listed, you can tell the program what options you have available for dinner and it searches Epicurious to find a recipe using your ingredients. Samsung has partnered with Unilever, so every once in a while a coupon for a particular product will appear on your screen. We’re waiting for the day it will be smart enough to know what items you’re running low on, and then offer coupons for what you need. The Samsung T9000 Refrigerator will be available later this year, but there's a price for getting your kitchen life organized. It will set you back a whopping $4,000.  Watch the video above for our hands-on look — inside and out — of the new Smart Refrigerator, and let us know what features you’d like to see in a smart fridge.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/12/thief-photo-facebook/,Suspected Thief Posts His Photo on Victim's Facebook Page," One alleged tablet thief in South Africa may be the newest addition to our list of dumb criminals caught through Facebook. James and Barbara McCall experienced a recent spate of burglaries at their guesthouse in Hillcrest, KwaZula-Natal, and found their Samsung tablet missing after the latest incident, South Africa-based IOL News reported. Upon discovering the theft, McCall changed the login passwords for his social networks; that's when he saw a man's photo had been uploaded to his wife's Facebook page. He said he believes the man is one of the burglars. ""He probably did not realize he was doing it. Usually you never log off from a tablet, so it could have happened quite quickly.""  McCall handed the photo over to police, but so far, no arrests have been made. Check out the video, above, for more.  Images courtesy of Flickr, elhombredenegro "

While that's still far from what feature phones can manage, it's a significant improvement and would come in handy in many situations. The great thing about this case  is how little bulk it adds. It's 15mm thick and actually looks quite good.  Another case discussed in the video below is an LED case that's still a prototype. It increases your battery life, protects your phone, and adds an LED panel to the back of it. The cool thing about the LED panel is that you can connect to it with Bluetooth and push custom notifications to it. You can already use the the built-in iPhone flash for alerts, but with this case you would get different notifications from each app. While I don't care about getting better notifications on the back of my phone, I'm sure some people will see the benefits of having the LED panel. There's no doubt that uNu is doing interesting things with cases. Learn more about what the company's up to here.  Powerful yet fun DIY robotics for adults and children.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/13/aaron-swartz/,Technology's Greatest Minds Say Goodbye to Aaron Swartz,"The technology community's brightest minds are memorializing Aaron Swartz, the 26-year-old programmer and digital rights activist who committed suicide Friday months before his trial over computer fraud was set to begin. Swartz was nothing short of a prodigy: at the age of 14, he helped develop the Real Simple Syndication (RSS) standard, paving the way to services such as Google Reader. He worked on the Open Library, which has a goal of putting one page online for every book ever published. He founded Infogami, which was eventually incorporated into Reddit before the sale to Conde Nast, a move that gave him the means to detach and take up various causes at his pleasure. ""He was brilliant, and funny. A kid genius. A soul, a conscience, the source of a question I have asked myself a million times: What would Aaron think,"" wrote Harvard academic, activist and personal friend of Swartz Lawrence Lessig.  ""He was a kind of 21st century, nerd renaissance man,"" wrote MSNBC's Chris Hayes in a blog post Sunday.  ""Wanderers in this crazy world, we have lost a mentor, a wise elder"", wrote World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee. Developing code, however, was far from Swartz's only fixation. He was a dedicated believer in the open-source/open-code/open-web ideology, working on causes such as net neutrality and data liberation while also helping to bring about the Creative Commons content licensing structure. He founded Demand Progress, a digital rights group that played an instrumental role in defeating the Stop Online Piracy Act early last year. ""He had an astonishingly broad range of interests, from health care to political corruption,"" wrote technology policy reporter Timothy Lee in the Washington Post. ""But Internet freedom and public access to information were two recurring themes in his life and work."" It was Swartz's dedication to that ideology, which Timothy Lee called ""aggressive, perhaps even reckless,"" that contributed to his becoming the target of a federal hacking investigation. Swartz, having previously wrote an automated program to free court documents from a government paywall using libraries' credentials, used a similar tactic to ""liberate"" academic articles hosted and charged for by JSTOR. First, Swartz began downloading JSTOR articles en masse over the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's wireless network. After MIT cut him off from wireless access, he sneaked into a network closet and plugged into the school's wired network, a move that was discovered by the school. In July of 2011, Swartz was charged by the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts with computer fraud and other charges that in total carried a potential sentence of 35 years in jail and $1 million in fines. JSTOR later dropped its charges against Swartz (and has since said it ""regretted being drawn into"" the case), but MIT was less clear about its wishes (MIT's president, Leo Rafael Reif, said in a statement released Sunday that ""it pains me to think that MIT played any role in a series of events that have ended in tragedy. He also announced an internal investigation of MIT's involvement). U.S. attorney Carmen M. Ortiz decided to go full steam ahead with the trial, which was expected to begin later this year. The intensity of the charges against Swartz in combination with Ortiz's decision to proceed despite JSTOR's decision to drop the case became the subject of much controversy, which has only magnified since Swartz's death. Swartz's family in a statement blamed his suicide in part on ""a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach"" and on the U.S. Attorney's office's decision to pursue ""an exceptionally harsh array of charges, carrying potentially over 30 years in prison, to punish an alleged crime that had no victims."" Lessig also placed a share of the blame on ""the absurdity of the prosecutor’s behavior"" in a blog post entitled ""Prosecutor as bully."" An excerpt from Lessig's impassioned post: For the outrageousness in this story is not just Aaron. It is also the absurdity of the prosecutor’s behavior. From the beginning, the government worked as hard as it could to characterize what Aaron did in the most extreme and absurd way. The ""property"" Aaron had ""stolen,"" we were told, was worth ""millions of dollars"" — with the hint, and then the suggestion, that his aim must have been to profit from his crime. But anyone who says that there is money to be made in a stash of ACADEMIC ARTICLES is either an idiot or a liar. It was clear what this was not, yet our government continued to push as if it had caught the 9/11 terrorists red-handed. As a memorial to Swartz, some academics have been sharing their articles for free with the Twitter hashtag #pdftribute. Lessig did not, however, completely exonerate Swartz, instead arguing that ""Aaron brought Aaron here"" through his alleged actions.  ""The causes that Aaron fought for are my causes too,"" wrote Lessing. ""But as much as I respect those who disagree with me about this, these means are not mine."" Many commentators have pointed out that Swartz had been suffering from depression since at least 2007, when he wrote about his struggle with ""depressed mood"" in detail. Some believe Swartz's mental health played some role in his death. ""Depression strikes so many of us. I've struggled with it, been so low I couldn't see the sky, and found my way back again, though I never thought I would,"" wrote Cory Doctorow, describing his own battle with depression in a  moving tribute to Swartz. The ultimate reason, or combination of reasons, for Swartz's death may never be fully understood. But Wired's's Kevin Poulsen put five simple words to the feeling shared by many this weekend: ""His death is a tragedy."" Photo courtesy of Flickr, ragesoss "

At 30-years-old, it's still rare to find the Chicago-based entrepreneur without a handful of yellow figurines stashed somewhere in his jacket — albeit for slightly different reasons now.    Pike recently brought his love of LEGO to Tumblr with Brickstagram. The page is stacked with splendidly twisted photos of LEGO minifigs arranged in whimsical, whatever-comes-to-Pike's-mind situations. Think an aqua monster sifting through bubbles or a cross-legged fig serenely sitting by a Buddha statue.   Despite the page's lighthearted theme, Brickstagram started from a relatively dark time in Pike's life. Last year, shortly before he started the page, doctors diagnosed him with throat cancer.   ""One of my friends brought LEGOs to my hospital room as a way to cheer me up,"" he said. ""Whenever I was bored, then — and feeling good from morphine — I'd take pictures of them with my camera phone. People started bringing in more, so I just kept taking pictures."" SEE ALSO: LEGO-Inspired iPhone 5 Cases Will Make You Geek Out
 Pike began compiling his pictures on a website, using the minifig snapshots as a way to document his recovery process.  ""I used it as a sort of therapy. Really, it's how I stayed sane during all of it,"" he shared. ""People brought more and more LEGOs, and it sort of became a habit."" Pike is cancer free now, but old habits are hard to keep tucked away in the toy box. Brickstagram is focused less on telling his personal story like his first website, and more about sharing whatever concept — funny, dark or bizarre — comes to mind. He has also begun sharing his love of LEGO offline by donating part of his extensive collection to a friend's elementary school class in Chicago.   ""This class has a weekly story time where they read stories aloud,"" he said. ""At the end now, they get a challenge to build something — anything — from the story, using the Legos. I know it's a tiny, insignificant thing, LEGOs, but they helped me laugh and get through tough times."" Check out the gallery up top to see some of our favorite shots.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/13/effective-resume-tips/,4 Tips to Make Your Resume Stand Out,"Chelsea P. Gladden is the Director of Marketing and PR for  Flexjobs, an award-winning service that helps job-seekers find professional opportunities that also offer work flexibility, such as  telecommuting, freelance, part-time or alternative schedules . To learn more about Chelsea, visit  Flexjobs.com  or tweet her  @FlexJobsChelsea.  There it is: a stack of 150 resumes, received in the first hour of posting a job, piled up in the hiring manager’s email inbox. How will you stand out? These four tips for creating an effective, well-organized resume, should help you stay at the top of the pile and in the top of the hiring manager's mind. For most positions, HR reps just wants a resume they can read and that captures the skill sets they are looking for. Fonts such as Times New Roman and Georgia are your best bets for making it readable, as well as a 10- to 12-point size. Acceptable sans-serif fonts include Arial and Tahoma. Whichever your choice, make sure to stick to one to keep it presentable versus using a few different fonts that can crowd the page and make you appear disorganized. On the other hand, if you are applying for a creative position such as graphic design, your resume will likely be expected to bend the rules and show your creative pizzazz.  Assume a hiring manager is going to skim your resume quickly, in 15 to 20 seconds, and will concentrate mainly on the top half (much like you might skim the headlines in a newspaper). They will want to see immediately that your experience is a fit instead of tossing out your resume to get to the next in the pile because they didn’t see that you are a match. Highlight your most relevant skills and experience first and then work your way down to other pertinent information. The following resume subheadings could be included: Contact Info, Summary of Core Qualifications, Relevant Work Experience, Relevant Volunteer and Other Experience, Education and Honors & Awards. Resumes are not just a showcase of your experience and skills, but also of your personality. Speak with confidence and ease when describing your accomplishments. Try to come across as friendly and open, professional but personable, and super-knowledgeable in your field to add depth and interest to an otherwise rather boring document. Again, go for a resume that will be easy on the eyes and is formatted well, with plenty of white space. Attempt to keep it to one page (or two pages if you have more than five years experience in your field) and be absolutely certain there aren’t typos or grammatical errors — these will instantly land your submission in the trash. Be sure to review your resume often and make changes and updates as needed. There's nothing like a last-minute job application and an outdated resume that gets a too-quick scrubbing instead of an in-depth cleaning to derail your chances at being hired. Though you spend hours on your resume to stand out, hiring managers just want to be able to easily weed through their very large pile as quickly as possible. Sending in a clean resume that gets straight to the point will be your best bet at landing the interview. The Mashable Job Board connects job-seekers across the U.S. with unique career opportunities in the digital space. While we publish a wide range of job listings, we have selected a few job opportunities from the past two weeks to help get you started. Happy hunting!

Public speed-typing competitions and typewriter drawings were a popular form of entertainment and artwork. The earliest preserved example of typewriter art was made in 1898 by a woman named Flora Stacey. As computers advance, so does the ability to create unique artwork.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/13/essential-travel-tech-gadgets/,7 Tech Essentials for Any Kind of Travel,"I’m what you would call an International CES veteran. I’ve been covering the trade show long enough to know what kind of items I need to have on hand to get me through the long days and nights — and I’m not just talking comfy shoes.  Reporters walk a lot during the course of the day, and we carry plenty of gear. We depend on our laptops and cellphones to communicate with the rest of our team, as well as to file stories. Wi-Fi and cellular signals are also essential, but don’t always work the way they’re supposed to when there’s a lot of network traffic, so bringing backup is key. Here are the essentials I take with me when packing for any kind of travel: 
Graphic courtesy Innergie One day, we'll live in a perfect world where every device will use a universal charging connector. Until then, we have Innergie's Magic Trio. It's a charging cable that provides three connectors in one: mini USB, micro USB and a 30-pin connector. This was my best friend throughout the show. I was able to charge almost all my devices with it, using either my laptop or plugged into a USB-to-AC adapter. What's more, ""Magic Trio"" may soon become ""Magic Quartet,"" as the company will be adding a Lightning connector to the cable after Apple gives its approval.  
Graphic courtesy Belkin The press room can get pretty packed with reporters trying to work and charge up their devices at the same time. I never travel anywhere without my Belkin mini surge protector. It provides three extra outlets and two USB ports; this came in handy when there was just one open outlet left where I was sitting; I was able to plug in and add two more devices, as well as two items that charged via USB. Then, someone next to me asked if he could add his brick to mine — we created quite the tower of power (pictured above).  
Photo by Mashable 
Graphic courtesy MyCharge The only device that lost power more than I could find locations to charge it was my iPhone 5. While it provided great, fast coverage and took almost-postworthy pictures, I had issues with running out of battery power halfway through each day. Our team was using GroupMe to communicate, and we sent a lot of texts throughout the day. I also checked my calendar frequently to see where my next event or meeting was. I found myself one evening leaving my phone to be charged at the one booth I found that had a Lightning charger. To avoid this from happening again, I started bringing the MyCharge with me each day. It provided an extra charge to my phone during the day via a USB-to-Lightning cable that I brought with me. If I had events late into the night, I could always charge up the MyCharge off my laptop, so if I needed it again, it would be available. 
Graphic courtesy Antler Luggage I’m sure everyone whose toes I ran over hates me, but I’ve learned over the years, I can’t carry it all. I use a wheelie-bag to navigate the packed halls, and while it sometimes makes it difficult to get through the crowds, I don’t know how I would make it if I had to carry everything I bring with me each day — not to mention the things I collect throughout the day. Knowing I have the rolling bag also makes it easier for me to throw in those chargers and extra batteries because I’m not worried about the added weight. 
Photo by Mashable, Charlie White Wi-Fi in the press room can either be fabulous or useless. You never know. And companies don't usually provide Wi-Fi during their press conferences, so if you want to tweet out the latest news and send your material in, you need a mobile hotspot. I was using AT&T’s MiFi Liberate with speedy LTE, which never failed me once the entire time I was there. I only needed to remember to keep it charged, and it provided access when I needed it, whether in the press room, a crowded conference or on a shuttle bus from the hotel to the Las Vegas Convention Center.  The other lifesaver was an Ethernet-to-USB adapter for my laptop that doesn’t have a built-in Ethernet port. Others on my team didn't have this, and when the Wi-Fi failed, as it often does, they were out of luck — or signal. Another option in that situation would have been the TP Link Portable Router. If you have just one Ethernet line, you plug it into the tiny router which then becomes a hotspot. Up to ten people can then log on to its password-protected signal and share the connectivity. 
Graphic courtesy Plantronics Chatty airplane seatmates and the need to focus on work require a good set of headphones. A solid pair will help drown out the noise around you so you concentrate on getting some writing done. On this trip I took along the Plantronics Blackwire 700 Series USB Headset, because not only can I hear the interview audio I’m transcribing from my computer, they also pair to my cellphone via Bluetooth. That way, if I receive a call or text from someone on my team, I don't miss it because I'm submerged in silence. I can simply hit ""answer"" and the call will be routed to the headphones. 
Graphic courtesy Toddy Gear I often find myself trying to write a quick post while I'm grabbing lunch or a snack, resulting in sticky keys. Or my cellphone screen gets smudged from being pressed up to my cheek during a call. For those situations, there are Toddy Wipes. They're funky colored microfiber cloths. They come in a variety of vibrant, designer patterns, and they're washable, reusable, and have an antimicrobial coating to keep germs and bacteria from spreading.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/13/java-exploit/,Warning: Java Exploit Potentially Affecting More Than 850 Million Computers,"Security experts are recommending computer users disable or uninstall Java following the discovery of a zero-day Java exploit which allows hackers to take control of vulnerable Macs, PCs and Linux computers. The exploit takes advantage of a vulnerability left open in Java 7 Update 10, released in October of last year. It works by getting Java users to visit a website with malicious code that takes advantage of a security gap to take control of users' computers.  Update: Oracle has released Java SE 7 Update 11 to address the vulnerability. It ""strongly recommends"" that Java SE 7 users upgrade immediately. What's worse is this particular exploit is reportedly being used to push ransomware, a type of attack that demands users pay to have control of their computers returned from a hacker's grasp. Java's creator, Oracle, hasn't specified the number of users who have downloaded Java 7 Update 10. However, Java runs on more than 850 million computers and other devices. When Oracle released Update 10, it ""strongly recommended"" that users update to receive ""key security features and bug fixes."" The exploit was first discovered by French researcher Kafeine, who claimed to have found it running on a site registering hundreds of thousands of page views daily. ""This could be a [sic] mayhem,"" Kafeine wrote. SEE ALSO: Is Your Mobile Device Safe From Hackers?
 Should you be worried about this exploit? While security lapses are sometimes overblown, there are good reasons to take this one seriously: The U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a warning advising users to disable Java until a fix is discovered. Apple has apparently moved to disable Java in response to the threat. Mozilla took the opportunity to warn users and advertise ""Click to Play,"" a Firefox feature which stops Java from loading on individual web sites until a user allows it. Many security experts are advising users disable or uninstall Java for the time being. Our advice? It's probably a good idea to disable or uninstall Java until a fix is published. You can find out how to do that right here: How to disable Java in your web browser. How to uninstall Java for Mac. How to uninstall Java for Linux. Have you downloaded Java 7 Update 10? Will you disable or uninstall it in light of this new threat? Share in the comments. Graphic via iStockphoto, Henrik5000 "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/13/kids-apps-beauty/,Top 5 Apps for Kids You Don't Want to Miss,"Ages 8-up
Overall rating: 4.9 out of 5 stars Why we like it:  You can turn your iPhone or iPad into a planetarium -- how cool is that? Point your iPod Touch, iPad or iPhone at the sky (or ceiling) to harness the power of an augmented reality system paired with a database of the stars. The program uses your camera, compass, current location and accelerometers so you can turn your screen, like a periscope, to line up a celestial object.  Need to know: There's not much to not like about this app. This is one of the best science apps you can buy. It’s especially great for clear winter nights.  Ease of use: 9/10
Educational: 10/10
Entertaining: 10/10 $2.99 Ages 3-6
Overall rating: 4.7 out of 5 stars Why we like it: Beautifully illustrated with narration by children, this app contains fully orchestrated background music and related hot spots that are well designed and help the story along. Even subtle items, such the rings of the sun shown in the African scene, can be spun with a swipe. As they move, they give off a rattle that fits nicely in the background music.  Need to know: If you're expecting visuals from the famous ride, you may be disappointed. If you're looking for a nice bedtime book with exposure to quality art and music, this is a good choice.  At 133 MB, this is a large download. It's also a rare Disney production that is completely free of mouse ears. Walt would, most likely, be pleased.  Ease of use: 9/10
Educational: 8/10
Entertaining: 10/10
 
$7.99 Ages 5-up
Overall rating: 4.7 out of 5 stars Why we like it: Pricey but astounding, The Numberlys will go down as the most zany, beautiful alphabet book ever made. It comes from the studio that created The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Lawrence Lessmore. Need to know: The comical narrator has a thick (perhaps Russian) -sounding accent. The navigation system makes it easy to jump between pages, and there are options that let you turn on/off the help and/or the narrator. Because of the way in which the art, interactivity and story work hand-in-hand, this title was awarded an honorable mention in the 2012 BolognaRagazzi Digital Awards. Ease of use: 9/10
Educational: 9/10
Entertaining: 10/10 $5.99 Ages 3-6
Overall rating: 4.4 out of 5 stars Why we like it: This innovative app stretches the definition of e-book, with a dash of Nosy Crow irreverence.  Rounds: Franklin Frog is the first title in the series of nonfiction apps that deal with life-cycles. We like how it breaks the typical patterns. Need to know: The background music is extremely well done and stays in the background, but you can't turn it off or separate it from the narration or other sounds. This criticism is more relevant for classroom settings. Ease of use: 9/10
Educational: 10/10
Entertaining: 8/10 $4.99 Ages 7-up
Overall rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars Why we like it: Do you know what ""'efficacious"" means? This fast-paced word-sorting game provides practice with opposing words of the variety that just might end up on an SAT someday.  Need to know: The words starts easy, with word pairs, like ""up-down,"" but get harder, with custom words drawn from biology, economics, politics, medicine, poetry and classical Greek prefixes. The levels can be a little harsh, especially when the words are drawn from a large list. Ease of use: 8/10

http://mashable.com/2013/01/13/minority-report-software/,"To Predict Crimes, 'Minority Report' Precog-Like Software Tested","More and more lately, we're witnessing technologies from our favorite sci-fi films and television shows getting closer to reality. The latest is like something from Minority Report — it's a new kind of software meant to predict the actions of criminals.  Police in Baltimore and Philadelphia are already using the software to prevent murders, and Washington D.C. is next on the list. Don't worry, no one is keeping psychics in a pool. Well, not that we're aware of ....  The technology was developed by Richard Berk, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. The hope is to decrease murders and other crimes.  But how does it work? The software isn't used to predict what you or I might do in the future, but what those already convicted of crimes and headed for parole might do. ""When a person goes on probation or parole they are supervised by an officer. The question that officer has to answer is 'what level of supervision do you provide?'"" Berk told ABC News. The level of supervision is dependent on the parole officer's best guess. The officer looka at the prisoner's record and decides what's appropriate,  but now, it's the software that assesses the likelihood to commit another crime.
 Beginning several years ago, the researchers assembled a dataset of more than 60,000 various crimes, including homicides. Using an algorithm they developed, they found a subset of people much more likely to commit homicide when paroled or probated. Instead of finding one murderer in 100, the UPenn researchers could identify eight future murderers out of 100. Berk's software examines roughly two dozen variables, from criminal record to geographic location. The type of crime, and more importantly, the age at which that crime was committed, were two of the most predictive variables.
 So it's not simply a case of a murderer likely to commit the crime again. There are many factors involved. ""People assume that if someone murdered then they will murder in the future,"" said Berk. ""But what really matters is what that person did as a young individual. If they committed armed robbery at age 14 that's a good predictor. If they committed the same crime at age 30, that doesn't predict very much."" The software is also used to predict which criminals may themselves be victims of murder, leading many to make the connection to the Steven Spielberg film, Minority Report. Berk said, ""We aren't anywhere near being able to do that."" Washington, D.C. is currently only testing the software on lesser crimes, but if proven successful, will likely spread out its use to more serious offenses.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/13/mit-aaron-swartz/,MIT to Investigate its Role in Aaron Swartz Case,"Leo Rafael Reif, president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, announced in a statement Sunday that the school will be conducting an investigation of its involvement in the case of Aaron Swartz, the 26-year-old programmer and digital rights activist who committed suicide in his New York City apartment Friday. ""Now is a time for everyone involved to reflect on their actions, and that includes all of us at MIT,"" Reif wrote. ""I have asked Professor Hal Abelson to lead a thorough analysis of MIT’s involvement from the time that we first perceived unusual activity on our network in fall 2010 up to the present. I have asked that this analysis describe the options MIT had and the decisions MIT made, in order to understand and to learn from the actions MIT took."" Lief added that he will share the report publicly once it has been completed. Swartz, who believed deeply in the principle of open information, was charged with computer fraud and other crimes in July 2011 after sneaking into an MIT network closet to free academic research from JSTOR. Swartz's charges carried a sentence of up to 35 years in jail and $1 million in fines.  JSTOR later dropped its civil charges, but MIT was opaque about its wishes. The U.S. Attorney's office decided to pursue the case, which was scheduled to begin this spring.  Some of those who have commented on Swartz's suicide have put varying degrees of the blame on MIT — something Lief acknowledged in his statement. ""I want to express very clearly that I and all of us at MIT are extremely saddened by the death of this promising young man who touched the lives of so many,"" Reif wrote. ""It pains me to think that MIT played any role in a series of events that have ended in tragedy."" Swartz was not a student at MIT.  SEE ALSO: Technology's Greatest Minds Say Goodbye to Aaron Swartz
 Many of the world's top technology minds have spent their weekend eulogizing Swartz. Hundreds of academics and researchers from around the world have been posting their work online to memorialize him, using the Twitter hashtag #PDFtribute. Read Reif's full statement, below: To the members of the MIT community:  Yesterday we received the shocking and terrible news that on Friday in New York, Aaron Swartz, a gifted young man well known and admired by many in the MIT community, took his own life. With this tragedy, his family and his friends suffered an inexpressible loss, and we offer our most profound condolences. Even for those of us who did not know Aaron, the trail of his brief life shines with his brilliant creativity and idealism.  Although Aaron had no formal affiliation with MIT, I am writing to you now because he was beloved by many members of our community and because MIT played a role in the legal struggles that began for him in 2011.  I want to express very clearly that I and all of us at MIT are extremely saddened by the death of this promising young man who touched the lives of so many. It pains me to think that MIT played any role in a series of events that have ended in tragedy.  I will not attempt to summarize here the complex events of the past two years. Now is a time for everyone involved to reflect on their actions, and that includes all of us at MIT. I have asked Professor Hal Abelson to lead a thorough analysis of MIT's involvement from the time that we first perceived unusual activity on our network in fall 2010 up to the present. I have asked that this analysis describethe options MIT had and the decisions MIT made, in order to understand and to learn from the actions MIT took. I will share the report with the MIT community when I receive it.  I hope we will all reach out to those members of our community we know who may have been affected by Aaron's death. As always, MIT Medical is available to provide expert counseling, but there is no substitute for personal understanding and support.  With sorrow and deep sympathy, L. Rafael Reif.

Zeddie Little was happily jogging along in the 2012 Cooper River Bridge Run in South Carolina, when a photographer snapped a shot of Little and his perfectly pearly teeth.  The photo of the dashing runner was posted to Reddit in April under the title “My friend calls him ‘Mr Ridiculously Photogenic Guy.’”  Ridiculously Photogenic Guy ended up charming the Internet enough to earn a spot in meme history, even if he did lose the race. Octogenarian Cecilia Gimenez attempted to restore a 19th century church fresco, but instead, her amateur painting skills turned Jesus into a cartoon version of himself.  A BBC Europe reporter described the finished piece as “a crayon sketch of a very hairy monkey in an ill-fitting tunic.” The botched fresco also drew comparisons to Rowlf the Dog and Brutus Buckeye. The bad makeover dropped jaws across the web over the summer, especially after Gimenez demanded payment for her shoddy paint job. The Photoshopping wizards of the Internet put the Potato Jesus face on other famous works of art.  The sourpuss mug of a cat named Tardar Sauce scratched the Internet with delight in September. A Reddit user shared a photo of the grouchy-faced feline and the Grumpy Cat meme began spreading its crabbiness around the web. Grumpy Cat (and her brother, Pokey) now have their own website, which posts a “Daily Grump” and sells merchandise like t-shirts and Scrooge-like holiday cards.  Clint Eastwood’s somewhat surprise appearance at the GOP Convention had Republicans excited for Dirty Harry badassness. Instead, they got 10 minutes of the Hollywood legend talking to an empty chair.  The bizarre appearance spawned both the @InvisibleObama Twitter account and the Eastwooding photo fad, in which people shared images of empty chairs. Sorry, couches, but Eastwood crowned chairs the hottest furniture of 2012. An intense-eyed 20-something named Laina scared the crap out of men everywhere when her face first went viral as an advice animal macro this summer. The Overly Attached Girlfriend meme featured a screengrab from a parody Justin Bieber fan video created by Laina. The stalkerish lyrics and potent stare made Overly Attached Girlfriend the most loveable clingy lady friend in Internet history. In 2012, dog humiliation caught on like fleas at the dog park. Tumblr Dogshaming featured photos of pooches wearing signs that spelled out their transgressions — for the whole Internet to see. Dog owners with poop scoot marks on carpet or drawers filled with chewed up panties punish their furry friends with web-blasted embarrassment.   The 2012 presidential election was brought to you by the letter B. Mitt Romney’s debate meme-lights included references to Big Bird, Binders Full of Women, and Horses and Bayonets.  The Triple B threat ensured that election season had plenty of laughs to help distract from the real (and boring) issues.  Mitt Romney may not have scored the White House gig, but at least he’ll have something to laugh at. Or maybe not. A photograph of Hillary Clinton looking like a badass diplomat while donning sunglasses and checking her phone went seriously viral. And thus, Texts From Hillary was born. The Tumblr created multi-pane pics that feature Hillz’s faux reactions to texts from people like Sarah Palin and Barack Obama. The creators of the Tumblr made the decision to go out on top after meeting the secretary of state. The dignified goodbye earns extra kudos, especially when most of the Internet would be happy to stretch its fame.  The Swedish Chef may have coined Börk speak, but in 2012, the Internet couldn’t get enough of Berk speak. A photograph of a vest-sporting girl holding Goosebumps books debuted on Reddit in March and soon inspired a series of advice animal knockoffs. The widespread use of Ermahgerd talk (or Berks speak) even spawned web translators to help people perfect their lisped quips. U.S. Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney did not win the most medals amongst the Fab Five, but her ‘tude-filled face did help make her the most Internet famous.  After a tumble on her signature event, Maroney had to settle for a silver medal in the vault competition. During the medal ceremony, a photographer snapped a shot that seemed to sum up the gymnast’s feelings about her second place finish. The scowl flipped its way across the web and got ‘Shopped to gold medal glory on the Tumblr McKayla Is Not Impressed and elsewhere.  President Obama even got in on the unimpressed action recently, solidifying McKayla Is Not Impressed as the meme for 2012. Image courtesy of @rctruitt "

The park opened in the summer of last year. It reportedly cost $48 million to build and is ""pretty huge,"" according to Reddit user Francesca Timbers who originally posted these pictures republished here with permission. ""I thought it was great,"" posted Timbers. ""A lot of the rides used 4-D and special effects, which I hand't experienced much of before. There was a good roller coaster with loops, where you are lying horizontally, face forward, like you are flying. That was my favourite ride.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/2014-corvette-unveiled/,Chevy Unveils 2014 Corvette at Detroit Auto Show,"Photo via Getty News/Bill Pugliano Photo via Getty News/Bill Pugliano Photo via Getty News/Bill Pugliano Photo via Getty News/Bill Pugliano Photo via Getty News/Bill Pugliano Photo courtesy Chevrolet Photo courtesy Chevrolet Photo courtesy Chevrolet Photo courtesy Chevrolet Photo courtesy Chevrolet Photo courtesy Chevrolet Photo courtesy Chevrolet Photo courtesy Chevrolet Photo courtesy Chevrolet Photo courtesy Chevrolet Photo courtesy Chevrolet Photo courtesy Chevrolet The 2014 Corvette has been completely redesigned, and Chevrolet rolled it out for the first time on Sunday night at the Detroit Auto Show. The company revealed a car that features styling cues from the iconic 1960s Corvette coupled with the latest carbon-fiber materials — resulting in a sports car that makes a bold statement for the recently imperiled Detroit automaker. They're even calling it the Stingray, just like that fast-backed Corvette Stingray from the early '60s, a vehicle that was designed by GM to show those European gearheads that America could also build a powerful sports car with appealing design.  The base 2014 model will be the Corvette Stingray, and the Corvette Z51 will offer Magnetic Ride Control, brake improvements and 19-inch wheels instead of the standard 18-inch size.  The new Stingray is called ""C7"" by enthusiasts because it's the seventh redesign of the Corvette in its 60-year history. This 2014 model is more powerful at 450 hp than the standard 2013 Corvette's 430 hp. It delivers more torque than its predecessor as well — 450 pound-feet of acceleration that's certain to press a lead-footed driver deep into its sporty seats. Chevrolet wasn't specific about Stingray's pricing, but did say that car buyers who can afford a currently available Corvette will be able to afford this new Stingray when it's released sometime during the third quarter of this year. Currently, 2013 Corvettes can be obtained at a starting price of $49,600, with most of them costing at least $55,000 once a buyer has added a few options. The entire car has been almost completely redesigned; Chevrolet said there are only two parts used in the 2014 Corvette that were used in the 2013 model. At 177 inches, the 2014 model is a couple of inches longer than the Corvette C6, and has a wider stance, with a wheelbase that's an inch wider. The new model's frame has been changed from steel to aluminum to reduce weight, and the roof and hood are made with lightweight carbon fiber. The result is a car that is lighter and has a significantly lower center of gravity. The interior is also a noticeable improvement over today's Corvettes, with lots of stitched leather instead of plastic, as well as carbon-fiber trim.   The reveal of the new Corvette wasn't a complete surprise; sites such as Jalopnik already had spy photos of the new car long before its official introduction on Sunday night. Chevy also released a teaser video last month that showed little parts of the new car.  Still, when Chevy's pictures of the Corvette were released Sunday night, even those who were never enthusiastic about past Corvettes were highly impressed with the technology and design of the 2014 Corvette Stingray. To give you a closer look at its new car, Chevrolet has launched its official 2014 Corvette site, which includes complete specs, notes and lots of pictures.  What do you think of this new sports car? Can it challenge the supremacy of the great European supercars? Let us know in the comments. Images via Getty News/Bill Pugliano and courtesy Chevrolet "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/aaron-swartz-plea-deal/,Aaron Swartz Plea Deal Reportedly Rejected Days Before His Death,"Aaron Swartz, the 26-year-old programmer and digital luminary who took his own life Friday, did so only days after his lawyers unsuccessfully attempted to strike a plea deal with prosecutors over a computer fraud case, according to a report. Swartz, whose trial was expected to begin in the spring, was facing a maximum sentence of 35 years in jail and up to $1 million in fines.  Swartz's lawyer, Elliot Peters, made the second of two attempts at striking a plea deal with Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Heymann as recently as last Wednesday, according to a Monday report from the Wall Street Journal. Peters told the Journal that no compromise was reached, as Heymann stuck to the government's earlier position: Swartz would have to plead guilty to every charge and face at least some time behind bars — possibly six months but up to seven years, according to a ""person familiar with the matter."" Swartz, an ardent believer in the principle of free information, was charged in July of 2011 with computer fraud and other crimes after sneaking into a Massachusetts Institute of Technology network closet and using the school's connection to download millions of academic and research files from JSTOR without paying for them. Swartz was not a student at MIT. Swartz did not leave behind an explanation for his suicide, but friends and loved ones have identified several possible reasons, including government prosecutors' desire to punish Swartz to the fullest extent of the law.  Lawrence Lessig, longtime friend of Swartz, wrote in a blog post that, ""From the beginning, the government worked as hard as it could to characterize what Aaron did in the most extreme and absurd way."" Swartz's family, too, blamed prosectors' overreach, saying in a statement that Swartz was facing ""an exceptionally harsh array of charges, carrying potentially over 30 years in prison, to punish an alleged crime that had no victims."" According to Swartz's girlfriend, Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, the impending case was to be a financial and social burden for Swartz, as he would need to seek help for legal fees while some of his friends were being subpoenaed. ""It was too hard for him to ask for the help and make that part of his life go public,"" Stinebrickner-Kauffman told the Journal. ""One of the things he felt most difficult to fathom was asking people for money."" SEE ALSO: Technology's Greatest Minds Say Goodbye to Aaron Swartz
 Suicide is, however, rarely the result of only one cause. Swartz's previous battles with mental illness and depression were at points severe. He wrote about his ""depressed mood"" publicly in 2007. Reddit co-founder and colleague Alexis Ohanian told the Journal that one of Swartz's blog posts on the subject was so alarming it convinced him to alert the police, while others who have written about Swartz's death, including Cory Doctorow, have speculated his depression played some role in his suicide.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/aaron-swartz-sopa/,Watch Aaron Swartz Explain 'How We Stopped SOPA'," Aaron Swartz, the 26-year-old digital luminary who took his life Friday, played an instrumental part in organizing the technology community's opposition to the Stop Online Piracy Act early last year.  SOPA was designed to combat online piracy, but many Internet advocates — Swartz included — believed it would have a disastrous effect on Internet freedom.  In a keynote delivered to the 2012 F2C: Freedom to Connect conference, Swartz explained in depth how the technology community was able to quickly organize and ultimately cause SOPA's author to shelve the bill. ""The Internet really is out of control,"" said Swartz. ""But if we forget that, if we let Hollywood rewrite the story so it was just big company Google who stopped the bill, if we let them persuade us we didn't actually make a difference, if we start seeing it as someone else's responsibility to do this work, and it's just our job to go home and curl up on the couch, pop some popcorn and watch Transformers, well then next time, they might just win. Let's not let that happen."" SEE ALSO: Technology's Greatest Minds Say Goodbye to Aaron Swartz
 To help defeat SOPA, Swartz founded Demand Progress, an advocacy group focused on Internet legislation. Demand Progress continues its work today.  ""We will be in touch with our members and the general public in the near future to offer suggestions about ways to move forward,"" said the group in a statement on Swartz's death. ""Tragically, we’ll have to continue to stifle the visceral impulse to run our half-formed ideas by Aaron, to help us make them better ones."" Photo courtesy of Flickr, selfagency "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/ad-agency-linkedin-bomb/,How an Ad Agency Used a 'LinkedIn Bomb' to Land a New Client,"As everyone who watches Mad Men knows, the ad business is tough. Winning over new clients is particularly challenging.  But a Lexington, Ky., ad agency used a tool that didn't exist in Don Draper's day — LinkedIn — to grab the attention of a potential client in a way that would have made Draper smile, or at least smirk.  Cornett Integrated Marketing Solutions calls the stunt a ""Linkedin Bomb."" Here's how it happened: In April, everyone in the agency sent LinkedIn requests to A&W Restaurants President Kevin Bazner and Director of Marketing Sarah Blasi at the exact same time. The messages were all headed ""Welcome to Lexington"" because A&W had just moved its headquarters from Louisville after being spun off from Yum Brands.  Blasi says she was at a photo shoot and ""all of the sudden I got about 35 LinkedIn notifications at once."" At first she thought someone had hacked her account. Then she read them. ""They were all individual stories about their personal relationships with A&W Restaurants."" One was from a guy who visited the restaurant with his grandfather when he was a kid. Another was from someone who's first date with the woman who became his wife was at an A&W.  The stunt was a shot in the dark. No one at the agency actually knew anyone at A&W. No one knew if the company was looking for a new ad agency. (It turns out they weren't, really.) The LinkedIn Bomb got Cornett's foot in the door, though. After several months of meetings and evaluations, the two companies are planning to announce on Tuesday that Cornett is A&W's agency of record now.  Of course, the bomb could just as easily have backfired. ""There was a moment when we thought we could really get their attention, but not in a good way,"" says Christy Hiler, chief strategic officer for the agency. (Her husband, Whit, came up with the LinkedIn Bomb idea.)  For Blasi, the key was that the messages themselves showed a strong affinity for the brand. Says Blasi: ""It was crazy. I went from thinking I was hacked to a few seconds later thinking 'Wow, they took time to write personalized notes.'"" Image courtesy of Flickr, Artgoeshere "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/anonymous-hacks-mit/,"Anonymous Hacks MIT, Leaves Farewell Message for Aaron Swartz","The Anonymous hacktivist group appears to have hacked MIT's website, leaving a tribute for Aaron Swartz, the online activist who recently committed suicide.  Swartz was a the co-founder of Demand Progress and founder of Infogami, a service later merged with Reddit. He committed suicide in New York City on Jan. 11. MIT's website was defaced with a message claiming the prosecution of Swartz, who was arrested in 2011 for allegedly harvesting academic papers from the JSTOR online journal archive, was a ""a grotesque miscarriage of justice"".  ""The situation Aaron found himself in highlights the injustice of U.S. computer crime laws, particularly their punishment regimes, and the highly-questionable justice of pre-trial bargaining. Aaron’s act was undoubtedly political activism; it had tragic consequences,"" says the message.  In the message, the Anonymous also lists several ""wishes,"" including a reform of computer crime laws as well as copyright and intellectual property law. ""We call for this tragedy to be a basis for reform of computer crime laws, and the overzealous prosecutors who use them. We call for this tragedy to be a basis for reform of copyright and intellectual property law, returning it to the proper principles of common good to the many, rather than private gain to the few. We call for this tragedy to be a basis for greater recognition of the oppression and injustices heaped daily by certain persons and institutions of authority upon anyone who dares to stand up and be counted for their beliefs, and for greater solidarity and mutual aid in response. We call for this tragedy to be a basis for a renewed and unwavering commitment to a free and unfettered internet, spared from censorship with equality of access and franchise for all."" The defacement of MIT's website comes hours after the institution announced it will be conducting an investigation of its involvement in the case of Aaron Swartz. Image credit: Flickr, peretzp "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/apple-cuts-orders-iphone5/,Report: Apple Cuts Parts Orders on Weak iPhone 5 Demand,"As an illustration that iPhone 5 sales are not as strong as expected, Apple has cut orders for components for the model, according to a report. The Wall Street Journal, citing ""people familiar with the situation,"" reports that Apple cut its order for iPhone 5 screens for the January-March quarter ""by roughly half of what the company had previously planned to order."" Apple notified suppliers about the reduced orders last month, according to the report, which adds that other component orders were also affected. Though the report garnered attention Monday morning, some pointed out that the information wasn't new. Peter Misek, an analyst with Jeffries & Co., for instance, noted the order cuts in a Dec. 14 note to clients. BGR also notes that the fiscal fourth quarter traditionally posts far fewer sales than the fiscal fourth quarter, so there's nothing unusual about cutting back in the face of en ebb in seasonal demand.  Apple could not be reached for comment on the report. The report comes as the market share for Android-based smartphones hit 72% globally last November, according to Gartner. Apple's iOS fell from 15% in Q3 2011 to 13.9% in Q3 2012, the researcher estimates. Apple's stock was down more than 3% in pre-market trading on the news and was flirting with $500. The company's stock price dropped to that level back in December for the first time in 10 months. Apple's stock had eclipsed $700 after the iPhone 5 launch. The subsequent drop off has come as other supplier reports have indicated weaker-than-expected demand, though Apple's iPhone 5 launch in China last month offered some hope for investors.  The apparent sales slowdown has prompted Apple to reportedly explore the idea of a cheaper iPhone model. Apple is expected to report its fiscal first-quarter results on Jan. 23.  Image courtesy of Apple Apple made its Louvre-like design famous in New York, but Shanghai’s stunning cylindrical glass entrance is a sight to see. A glass spiral staircase leads shoppers to the store below.  The Apple Opéra Store – facing the city’s famous Opera de Paris, is gorgeous and very Parisian. The location, which opened in 2010, features original décor from the bank that once occupied the space. Inside, carved wooden stairs with wrought-iron railings connect the floors, instead of Apple’s signature glass and chrome steps.  This artist rendering recently appeared in AixEnProvence.fr magazine and is said to be the design for Apple’s latest location in Aix en Provence, France. According to the image, the store will be a low-lying building made entirely of glass walls with just one solid, wood wall where the Genius Bar would be. It’s expected to open in late 2012 or early 2013. The Apple Store in Covent Garden is the heart of London. It features sweeping, covered archways outside the historic store and a central see-through ceiling inside. The interior also features two glass staircases, a spiral and a square-shaped one. What sets the Grand Central Station store in New York City apart from others – in addition to its record size of 23,000 square feet, making it the largest in the world – is its location. The store overlooks and wraps around the main concourse of New York’s classic commuter station from the East and North East balconies of the main concourse, which serves as a beautiful backdrop to the Apple experience.  Some 750,000 people pass by the store in an average day. Instead of Apple’s typical square-like exterior, the coating of glass that lines the Nanjing East (Shanghai) store is rounded on its corners.  Apple’s flagship store in Bejing in its Sanlitun shopping distract made the news recently after angry customers tossed eggs at the location after it cancelled the launch of the iPhone 4S -- due to the amount of people that flocked to the store and to ensure safety in the area. Launched in 2008, this was the company’s first Apple store in China.  Apple’s flagship store in Hong Kong – which launched in September 2011 – is unique in that it sits on what resembles an overpass, so cars can drive below.   Apple’s Fifth Avenue flagship store in New York has become iconic for its Louvre-like glass design and plunging glass staircase. Launched in 2006, the store is now a model for innovative design. Apple recently renovated the glass cube for an estimated cost of $6.6 million.  "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/apple-stock-500-weak-iphone-sales/,Apple Drops Below $500 on Reports of Weak iPhone 5 Demand,"Apple's stock briefly dipped below $500 a share on Monday for the first time this year, falling as low as $498 a share, a decline of more than three percent from Friday's closing price of $520.30.  The stock's decline comes after reports in The Wall Street Journal and Reuters suggested demand for the latest iPhone has been lower than expected.  The Journal cited ""people familiar with the situation"" who said that Apple has cut its orders for iPhone 5 screens in half for the March quarter. Likewise, Reuters cited Nikkei, a leading Japanese business daily publication, which reports that Apple has asked its LCD suppliers to halve its initial order of 65 million screens for the iPhone 5, in addition to cutting other components. Several analysts and publications have since raised doubts about these two reports, noting that the Journal's estimates are a month old and the Nikkei's estimates are based on an incredibly bullish assumption that Apple would order parts for 65 million iPhones when most expect it to sell fewer than 50 million iPhones that quarter. Still, the news has clearly unsettled investors as it reinforces concerns that the iPhone 5 is not selling as well as the company had hoped. As of publication, the stock was hovering around $503 a share.  AAPL data by YCharts Image courtesy of Flickr, Brett Jordan "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/arianna-huffington-gps-for-the-soul/,Arianna Huffington Doesn't Want You to Answer Her Emails On Weekends,"Amidst all the stress and running around from meeting to event and back to meeting again, there was one conversation I had during last week's International CES that was particularly calm and somewhat stress free. It was one with Arianna Huffington, president and editor-in-chief of Huffington Post Media Group. She told me she doesn't expect anyone to answer her emails at night or over the weekend.  Speaking at the Digital Health Summit about how we can actually use technology to improve our health and well being, Arianna, as she's known in the industry, talked about the need to prioritize de-stressing. She also showed off the guide from her newly-released app; GPS for the Soul. Walking the show floor at CES I was struck by the increase in the number of health and fitness devices have come on the market. In fact, the CEA says floor space devoted to health and wellness is up 25% over last year. So it seems we all want to know how much we're walking and how many calories we're burning in this fast-paced world, but Arianna says that's not enough.  ""We need to deal with our minds, not just our diet and bodies, our mind and spirit count for so much,"" she told me. ""That's where anxiety and depression and insomnia come from,"" she added. That's why it's important to prioritize de-stressing your life.  SEE ALSO: Fitbug Launches New Suite of Health Trackers  And she should know. Four and a half years ago, Arianna fainted from exhaustion, broke her cheek bone and wound up with stitches around her eye. That's why, she tells me, her current obsession with the issue of helping people de-stress stems from her own personal experience.  She launched the iPhone app, in conjunction with HeartMath, to create a guide for users — a course-correcting mechanism — to help them get back in sync. In addition to giving you your heart rate variability, it gives you something to focus on that makes you happy and calm. For Arianna, it's pictures of her family. For others it might be the ocean, poetry or a particular place. Users can show and share guides, as it has a very large social component. There are also expert guides from Dr. Oz and Deepak Chopra.  ""We're never going to eliminate stress, but we can reduce it,"" she tells me. ""Heart disease, diabetes, both are related to stress.""  I get that, but I have to confess, the words tech and stress-free just seem like an oxymoron to me. I still don't get how we can use the tech currently available to us to help de-stress our lives. Arianna's answer is simple, and this is where it really begins to make sense. Arianna says she always puts the day behind her before going to bed. She puts her phone on charge in another room. That way, even if she wakes up in the night, there's no temptation to sneak a peek at it.  ""You can't be tempted to look at it, even if you go back to sleep, you've allowed your day life to intrude into your recharging, restoring time,"" she tells me.  And no screen time before bed. Studies show reading on a screen before going to sleep can be detrimental to getting a good night's sleep. Arianna says she wants others on her staff to gain the same rejuvenation from sleep and relaxation as she does. No more emails that pull you in all weekend long. Arianna says she makes it clear to her staff ""If I send an email at eleven at night, it's to get it off my to-do list, but I don't expect a reply. And I make that very clear, I don't expect replies over the weekend."" Does she go so far as to have a tech-free weekend? It's more like a catch-up, which in some cases can help reduce stress as well. ""I go through my inbox on a Saturday, but I don't expect a reply over the weekend."" What about you, does tech make you more stressed? Could you go the weekend without responding to email? Let us know in the comments.  Photo via Michael Buckner/Getty Images Entertainment "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/avoid-getting-flu-at-work/,5 Ways to Avoid Getting the Flu at Work,"With one of the worst flu seasons in history under way, it is critical employees take the necessary steps to avoid getting themselves, or others, sick. A recent study found that 84% of employed adults have gone to work while sick, and nearly half of those employees make no attempt to warn others of their illness. In order to stay healthy, NSF International Public Information Officer Cheryl Luptowski advises employees to follow some simple guidelines. Here are a few that she mentions.
 Beware of common items: Studies have shown that germiest areas in offices were sink faucet handles in the break room, microwave door handles and keyboards. Employees should wipe down their workplace with a disinfectant on a daily basis, as well as wash their hands after touching common items like the refrigerator, microwave, door handle and faucets. Wash hands: Workers needs to make an effort to wash their hands before eating, after reading magazines in the break room and after meetings where they're sharing office equipment or shaking hands with people. Hands should be washed with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. Stay hydrated: In order to avoid dehydration, which when combined with a lack of sleep and stress compromises an immune system, employees should keep a jug of water at their desk. Vitamins: When workers start to feel under the weather, they need to consult with their health care provider about taking a supplement such as vitamin C or zinc. No touching: Employees must make a conscious effort to not touch their face during the workday. Touching eyes, noses and mouths gives germs direct access to the body and further compromises the immune system. NSF International is an independent, not-for-profit organization that provides standards development, product certification, auditing, education and risk management for public health and the environment.

That's according to the Beijing Air Monitor (@BeijingAir), a Twitter account run by the United States Embassy in Beijing that periodically tweets air sampling data from atop the embassy, per the New York Times. 01-12-2013 20:00; PM2.5; 886.0; 755; Beyond Index — BeijingAir (@BeijingAir) January 12, 2013 The air pollution level has since fallen to 152, which the account marks as ""Unhealthy"" based on Environmental Protection Agency standards.  A number on a scale is one thing, but what does it actually look like to be living in off-the-charts pollution?

No one can stop talking about the new albums forthcoming from Destiny's Child and Justin Timberlake. But, no, we haven't gone back in time to 2005. It just happened to be a very busy week for artists looking to make a comeback.  We premiered last week ""Nuclear,"" the first single from Destiny's Child in seven years. Over the weekend, Justin Timberlake released the new track ""Suit and Tie"" (which happens to feature an appearance by Beyonce's husband Jay-Z). David Bowie outshone them both, however: his first album in more than a decade has not yet dropped, but it is already at the top of the iTunes charts in 17 countries.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/bookless-library-bexar-county/,Nation's First Bookless Public Library Could Be in Texas,"Bexar County, Texas, has unveiled plans for what could become the nation's first bookless public library. The initiative is being pushed forward by County Judge Nelson W. Wolff, who told The San Antonio Express News that he was inspired to develop a bookless library after reading Walter Isaacson's authorized biography of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Wolff, whose own personal library contains more than 1,000 printed and bound first editions, believes future generations will have little use for hardcover or paperback volumes. The library system, dubbed BiblioTech, proposes to make thousands of e-books available for county residents both online and at a 5,000-square-foot physical location on the South Side of the county, according to a statement issued by Bexar County officials. Visitors would be able to check out books to read on their own e-readers or tablets, or borrow one of the library's 150 take-home e-readers. ""If you want to get an idea what it looks like, go into an Apple store,"" Wolff said. Several universities have already gone bookless, including the University of Texas at San Antonio, which is also situated in Bexar County, as well as Stanford University's engineering school. The concept has thus far failed to take root in city and county-wide institutions, however. In 2002, a small library branch offering only e-books opened in Pima County, Arizona, but began stocking printed books a few years later in response to community demand. In early 2011, a highly publicized proposal to replace a budget-strapped branch of a public library in Newport Beach, Calif., was dismissed following public outcry. Unlike the Newport Beach branch, which houses more than 30,000 books, Bexar County has no print legacy to contend with. The county currently lacks a public library system, instead paying $3.7 million per year to San Antonio city for access to its library, according to The San Antonio Express News. Given the growing affordability of e-readers as well as current book-buying trends — e-book sales surpassed hardcover sales in the U.S. for the first time in June, according to the Association of American Publishers — a bookless library makes a good deal of sense in the year 2013. The proposal has been met with early enthusiasm from the community. Wolff hasn't yet outlined the budget for the project and acknowledges that private donations will be needed to get it off the ground. Image courtesy of Flickr, AZ Adam "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/branch-roundtable-opens/,Social Discussion Platform 'Branch' Opens to Public,"One of the most talked-about new social platforms is finally opening up to the public. Branch, a website that lets users create discussions around social content, launched out of beta on Monday and will now let anyone with a Twitter account sign up.  Social networks such as Twitter already let users post conversation starters online, of course. But Branch hopes to take this a step further by providing a space for these conversations to continue and grow — or as the company puts it, to provide a ""home for dialogues online.""  Branch users can create conversations around tweets and articles by linking to the original URL. They can also flesh out any part of an exchange in a Branch thread, turning it into its own discussion. The startup was founded in 2011 by two college students and an Etsy designer. After several months of bootstrapping the company, initially called Roundtable, the trio joined the Obvious Corporation, an incubator launched by Twitter co-founders Evan Williams and Biz Stone.  Branch went on to raise a $2 million round of funding in early 2012, and emerged out of private beta in August.   In addition to launching publicly, Branch announced a couple new features that are common on other social networks, including giving users the ability to offer feedback on posts through likes, favorites and upvotes, and to view an activity feed of people listening in to their Branch conversations.  The service has also integrated SoundCloud and Spotify, so users can easily share music into their discussion threads.  Have you tried out Branch yet? What do you make of it? Share in the comments.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/brandon-spikes-celebration-dance/,NFL Player's Celebration Dance May Be the Best of All Time," Brandon Spikes made six tackles as his New England Patriots pummeled the Houston Texans in NFL playoff action on Sunday, but his greatest contribution to the win was undoubtedly this extremely fresh celebration dance after the Pats recovered a fumble during the game's third quarter.  An official review of the play actually nullified the fumble — but really, who cares? The pop. The lock. The crisp head turn. Spikes' sweet moves stand up to any review. GIFs and video clips of the dance were an immediate viral hit with fans of football and funny on Sunday and Monday.  Spikes is actually a man-about-Internet-town, too — this isn't his first time making a splash on the web. In a Christmas Eve tweet last month, the former Florida Gator mentioned leaving ""a big fat rail of coke and a shot of Jack for Santa this year,"" because cookies and milk don't fuel optimal present-delivery performance. In September, he used Twitter to blast the NFL's replacement referees, then told critical fans to ""bit me,"" enjoy their blow-up doll dates and ""kiss my whole ass.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/chartburst-musicians/,Chartburst Connects Unsigned Musicians With Record Labels,"The Internet has reshaped the music industry. More than ever, musicians can distribute and sell their music without the help of a record label.  Those still looking for that traditional ""big break"" in the form of a record contract, however, are probably having a tough time transcending the glut of unsigned music on the Internet. It seems like every Tom, Dick and Harry has been begging you to check out his band ever since MySpace became a popular music publishing site nearly a decade ago.  To address this disconnect, a brand new website called Chartburst is making an ambitious attempt to use music fans' input to sort through the rabble of undiscovered talent, for the benefit of record labels. The site launches its beta phase Monday.  SEE ALSO: Why Are People Still Buying CDs?
 Chartburst co-founder Francis Gane tells Mashable that the idea has the ear of talent scouts at about 30 record labels and management companies. ""For virtually every major label there is to speak of, we have an A&R [artist and repertoire representative] on board,"" he says. Indeed, Chartburst has amassed an impressive list of record labels across the nine genres the site will feature, including indie, pop, rock, dance, hiphop, world, country, folk and acoustic.  ""I am excited to see what the site can offer and am looking forward to hearing the first bands when the site goes live,"" Cleo Russell, a representative from Warner Music Group, tells Mashable. As the name of the site suggests, Chartburst will feature a chart-based ranking system. Artists can submit one song at a time to one of the charts, which reset every two weeks. At the end of the two-week period, the top five artists in terms of fan votes on each of the charts will have their music forwarded to genre-specific talent scouts.  Representatives from the labels will then provide feedback to the artist via email within two weeks. In theory, this connection could lead to record deals for said Chartburst artists. ""The site can't last unless people get signed,"" Gane says. ""That's what they're paying their money for, and that's what the A&R signed up for."" After a free trial period, artists must contribute a monthly fee to submit their music to the charts. The trial period lasts two months for beta users and one month for those who sign up when the site fully launches in several months. Beta users also get a discount on the monthly fee, which is $5 regularly but $2.50 for early adopters. You must like Chartburst's Facebook page to get a code to sign up for the beta, and there are a limited number of spaces. Chartburst is the brainchild of a father-and-son duo that has considerable music industry experience. The father, Laurie Gane, was a founding member of the Metropolitan Blues Quartet, a 1960s band that hit it big after becoming The Yardbirds.  ""He was replaced by Eric Clapton when he left the band,"" says Francis Gane, referring to his father. The elder Gane went on to open a recording studio in London in the 1970s. He eventually grew tired of city living and relocated to bucolic northwest Wales. He set up a new studio at his country dwelling called Bryn Derwen Recording Studio, which has hosted the likes of Bat for Lashes, Beth Orton and Starsailor. Francis Gane graduated from the University of Manchester in 2009. He studied software engineering. Growing up, Gane spent a lot of time helping around the studio. He is also a recording artist and DJ. At 25, this is Gane's first attempt at a startup. Though they are both 50/50 investors, the younger Gane is very much the driving force behind the project, while the edler has supplied both contacts and guidance drawn from his many years in the industry. ""He has provided advice all along the way, which has been pretty invaluable,"" Francis Gane says of his father's involvement with Chartburst. Make no mistake about it, Chartburst is a bold and ambitious idea. If it works, it could help democratize the music industry. For the site to work properly, however, it will have to satisfy three different factions: artists, music fans and record labels.  Musicians should be relatively easy to cajole — they get a potentially life-changing opportunity for a small investment. The site could become an effective tool for the record labels if the charts work properly. For that to happen, however, fans will need to engage with the site.  Chartburst could foreseeably turn into an annoying popularity contest, with bands constantly begging their social media followers to cast votes. The site will not work if music fans are only going to Chartburst out of obligation to their friends' bands, without attempting to discover new music. ""We're hoping that having this filtered system will really give people a chance to find great new music,"" Francis Gane says. ""Having a chart in which people's fans can vote for their favorite band's track is really giving the fans a vote, literally, in the future of popular music.""  To facilitate fan engagement, the idea begs for a free mobile app — a sort of Pandora for unsigned artists. Gane says he hopes to produce a mobile app soon after the site launches. Being true startup, the Ganes' current financial situation will not allow for development of a mobile app quite yet. ""We're a bootstrap father-and-son operation,"" Gane says. ""Assuming we get an investor on board or we start getting some income from the site, it will all be plowed back into the development of a nice shiny app."" Until then, the Chartburst team will need to find creative ways to keep fans interested. For every band that has ever begged for an opportunity to be heard, every music fan who has complained about hearing the same old stuff on the radio and every talent scout who has lamented the music logjam on the Internet, you all now have a place to call home. The quality of your collective nurturance will make or break this site. Images courtesy of Flickr, Michiel Jelijs and Chartburst "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/cnet-writer-resigns/,CNET Writer Resigns After Parent Company Meddles in Editorial Process,"CNET senior writer Greg Sandoval has resigned after parent company CBS Corp. forced editors of the tech product review site to remove Dish Network's Hopper with Sling DVR from consideration for its ""Best of CES"" awards. The reason for its removal? CBS is currently suing Dish for its ability to skip commercials, a feature that's included in the Hopper set-top box. A spokesperson for CBS Corp. acknowledged in an email to Mashable Monday morning that the DVR was made ineligible for the award ""due to active litigation involving our parent company CBS Corp."" Going forward, CNET staffers are not only forbidden to nominate products involved in litigation with CBS Corp. for award shows and other accolades, but also to review them, the spokesperson wrote. A similar statement was posted at the bottom of the page that hosted the livestream of the award announcements late last week, and on a (favorable) review of the Hopper box published just five days ago. To impose such a policy on a publication like CNET — whose primary product is in-depth, unbiased reviews on a wide variety of hardware — isn't just problematic; it's also a poor business decision. It undermines the credibility of the entire CNET operation, doing little damage to Dish Network in the process. Indeed, it calls into question the integrity of all of CBS Corp.'s journalistic properties — a portfolio that includes CBS News, CBS Sports and a range of news sites. It's for that reason that Sandoval resigned. ""I no longer have confidence that CBS is committed to editorial independence,"" he tweeted. ""We are supposed to be truth tellers.""  Hello all. Sad to report that I've resigned from CNET. I no longer have confidence that CBS is committed to editorial independence. CNET wasn't honest about what occurred regarding Dish is unacceptable to me. We are supposed to be truth tellers. I am not disgruntled. CBS and CNET were great to me. I just want to be known as an honest reporter. Thanks everyone for reading me. CNET had reviewed the Hopper and Dish's other commercial-skipping DVRs before. Why did CBS suddenly feel the need to get involved late last week? According to The Verge, this is how it played out: Executives at CBS learned that the Hopper would win ""Best of Show"" prior to the announcement. Before the winner was unveiled, CBS Interactive News senior-vice president and General Manager Mark Larkin informed CNET's staff that the Hopper could not take the top award. The Hopper would have to be removed from consideration, and the editorial team had to re-vote and pick a new winner from the remaining choices. Sources say that Larkin was distraught while delivering the news — at one point in tears — as he told the team that he had fought CBS executives who had made the decision. Apparently the move to strike the Hopper from the awards was passed down directly to Larkin from the office of CBS CEO, Leslie Moonves. Moonves has been one of the most outspoken opponents of the Hopper, telling investors at one point, ""Hopper cannot exist... if Hopper exists, we will not be in business with (Dish)."" According to sources, reviews lead Lindsey Turrentine, Larkin, and CBS Interactive president Jim Lanzone fought hard against the mandate from CBS, with numerous calls between CBS Interactive and CBS in New York. Thus far, Sandoval is the only CNET (and, for that matter, CBS Corp.) employee to speak out about the incident. We hope he won't be the last. Update: CNET's editor-in-chief has issued a statement on the matter. ""I stand by my team and the years of work they have put into making CNET what it is,"" she says of her reason for not quitting on the spot. ""But I wish I could have overridden the decision not to reveal that Dish had won the vote in the trailer. For that I apologize to my staff and to CNET readers. Image courtesy of Dish Network "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/darpa-deep-sea-sensors/,DARPA Eyes Pop-Up Deep Sea Sensors,"In a proposal almost as fanciful as the fictional 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency kicked off a research project last Friday to develop sensor systems that could be placed miles below the surface of the ocean and activated when needed by a remote command. DARPA said it wants to develop a system that can store unmanned sensors such as waterborne or airborne cameras, decoys, network nodes, beacons and jammers, in watertight capsules that can withstand pressure at depths up to six kilometers (3.7 miles) and then be launched to the surface “after years of dormancy.” Nearly half of the world’s oceans have depths deeper than 4 kilometers (2.5 miles), DARPA said, “which provides a “vast area for concealment of storage” and this concealment “also provides opportunity to surprise maritime targets from below, while its vastness provides opportunity to simultaneously operate across great distance,” DARPA said. The agency said it envisions the subsystems of its Upward Falling Payloads projects will consist of a sensor payload, a “riser” providing pressure tolerant encapsulation of the payload and a communication system triggering launch of the payload stored on a container with an inner, 4-7/8 inch diameter and a length of 36 inches. In the first stage of the three-phase project expected to cost no more than $1.75 million DARPA wants researchers to concentrate on a communications system that avoids “false triggers” of the deep-sea systems and can operate at long distances from the submerged sensors. Proposals for this phase also should detail the design of a capsule and riser system that will work after sitting for years on the seabed, and potential sensor systems for military or humanitarian use. The second phase of the project calls for the communication system to “wake up” the system on the seabed and launch it, with tests planned the Western Pacific in 2015 and 2016,though tests also could be conducted in the Atlantic or offshore Hawaii, DARPA said. In the third phase, planned for 2017, DARPA plans tests of a completely integrated and distributed Upward Falling Payloads system at full depth in the Western Pacific. Proposals are due March 12 and DARPA expects to make an award in June. Photo courtesy of Flickr, marfis75

The Pentagon's futuristic arm, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), wants your help to develop a next-generation amphibious armored vehicle. DARPA is about to release open-source software to allow anybody to become a tank designer. What's more, there's an enticing $1 million prize on the line. All the participants will go against each other in a contest called the FANG (Fast, Adaptable, Next-Generation Ground Vehicle) challenge. Other than the considerable money prize, you'll have a chance to see your design eventually become reality — DARPA will build the chosen one. The goal is to build ""new infrastructure for systems design development from a set of requirements — an idea on a cocktail napkin — all the way to a final fielded product,"" Lt. Col. Nathan Wiedenman, the DARPA program manager who heads the project, told Wired.   The first part of the contest, the Mobility/Drivetrain Challenge, will kick off today at noon EST. That's when DARPA will release the open-source software, called Meta on a dedicated website set up for the challenge. DARPA is also going to allow contestants to use its virtual workshop software called VehicleFORGE to share ideas and work together.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/dcm-dealer/,DCM Dealer Wants to Turn Twitter Into a Stock Trading Tool,"Paul Hawtin made headlines two years ago when his hedge fund Derwent Capital Markets became the first to use Twitter data to make investing decisions. The fund had a 1.85% return in its first month, seemingly proving the power of social media as a trading tool, but it shut down shortly afterwards as investors were hesitant to sign up. Now Hawtin is back with a new tool called DCM Dealer that hopes to turn Twitter into a stock trading tool for the masses by providing average investors with real-time sentiment analysis for stocks based on tweets.  DCM Dealer, which launched Monday, receives a pipeline of Twitter data from social data platform DataSift and uses several algorithms to weigh the meaning of the tweet for the stock, including analyzing keywords, looking at the number of followers the user has and his or her relationship to the company in question and factoring in how old the tweet is. The end result is a Twitter sentiment score of 0 to 100, with the higher numbers being more positive. The sentiment score isn't the only metric in the tool — there are other features like a built-in news feed for stocks and tools to manage your stock portfolio — but it's clearly the centerpiece that differentiates it from other trading platforms.  ""Investors have long accepted that the markets are driven by greed and fear, but how do you quantify that? Now we have so much data, so much valuable information. You can listen to what hundreds of millions of people are saying,"" Hawtin told Mashable.  Several reports have come out in recent years suggesting that posts on Twitter can be an incredibly accurate gauge for a stock's performance. In late 2010, researchers at Cornell published a paper showing that Twitter sentiment had an 87.8% accuracy rate in predicting day-to-day stock performance on the Dow Jones Industrial Index. More recently, DataSift found that Twitter sentiment correlated with price changes for Facebook's stock on the day of the IPO.  In his own experience, Hawtin says he's found that Twitter tends to be more precise for gauging the performance of more popular companies like Facebook and Apple, which have more people talking about them, rather than more obscure businesses. At launch, DCM Dealer analyzes Twitter data for 250 publicly traded companies, but Hawtin says the plan is to ramp up that number to about 8,000 companies in the next two months.  DCM Dealer is free to use for those living in the U.K. and Europe, as the company instead charges traders £2.5 (or about $4) for every trade placed through the service. However, in the U.S., the tool is considered a derivatives product and users are not allowed to place trades through it. As a result, DCM Dealer is offering the Twitter sentiment analysis as a standalone feature for $19.99 a month. Images courtesy of Flickr, bfishadow and DCM Dealer "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/do-you-need-voice-plan/,Do You Really Need a Voice Plan With That Fancy Smartphone?,"Talking and texting may have been the first things we used mobile devices for, but they’re hardly the only ones anymore. And when it’s just as easy to place a video call via Skype, send an instant message through WhatsApp, tweet, or check in on Facebook, summoning a phone’s dialer tends to be an afterthought. So could we could be approaching a time when it makes little sense to even have a voice or text plan. To get a sense of how feasible it might be to do without one, I spent the recent holiday week in December trying to abstain from using the voice and SMS services on my Android device (or my landline phone at the office). There are good reasons to think that a data plan may be all you need. People are indeed spending less time on wireless calls—only 1.8 minutes per call in 2011, down from 3.1 minutes in 2007—and according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, the number of minute is declining overall. Juniper Research predicts that one billion people will use voice and video calling through apps on mobile devices by 2017, about the same number that use smartphones today.  Simultaneously, 4G mobile networks are expanding and getting more reliable, Wi-Fi is available in more places, and a growing number of companies are offering very good free or low-priced voice, video chat and messaging apps that run over these data networks. Even Facebook is introducing free calling to its mobile Messenger app, starting with iPhone users in Canada; some carriers are also getting involved. Somewhat surprisingly, I could not last a whole week without voice. But it was a fascinating experiment, and I quickly realized that thanks to the new possibilities opened up by some clever apps,one-on-one data communication is gradually becoming more interesting. As an Android device owner, I used two mobile apps to make outgoing calls to any landline or mobile device: Skype, which is owned by Microsoft, and Rebtel, from a Swedish company that claims to be the second-largest mobile voice-over-IP service, with 20 million users globally. With either app, people could see my regular phone number when I dialed, and I set up call forwarding so that I could use Skype to answer all incoming calls to my normal Verizon account. The quality of mobile voice-over-IP is clearly improving, but it is not quite ready to replace traditional calling at a large scale. When calls went well, the voice quality actually seemed better than usual, and people on the other end often agreed. That will no doubt become a trend as carriers focus infrastructure investments on 4G networks—often at the expense of voice networks—and as app providers improve their own services.  For example, a Skype spokesman told me that the company is now working to integrate Opus, a newly standardized audio compression algorithm, to provide CD-quality sound in its desktop and mobile software. It was nice, too, that the apps replicated my usual dialing experience, integrating with all my phone contacts. And neither Skype nor Rebtel consumed unreasonable amounts of data (about 30 to 40 megabytes each in a week), even though I had them open most of the time (I did not use much video). But some calls didn’t go well at all, especially if I was trying to reach people on their phones, not through Skype or Rebtel accounts. Several calls were dropped or plagued by distracting audio delays, probably because of a poor data connection or a network that switched from 4G to 3G service.  Rebtel was generally more reliable, and it offers the option of switching to its local calling service over the cellular network in mid-call if data or Wi-Fi service begins getting patchy. But I cheated a number of times when I had to make important, quick, or time-sensitive phone calls and just used my device’s dialer. My attempt to avoid texting was more difficult, partly because I text a lot. Most messaging apps generally require the recipient to be signed up for the service as well. I barely found any of my usual contacts through the popular WhatsApp service, and only a few were on Skype. I was slightly more successful with Google Talk. Facebook Messenger came the closest to being an SMS replacement, since many of my friends were set up to receive mobile chats, and now the company doesn’t even require a Facebook account to sign up. The experiment was hypothetical, of course, and few smartphone owners seem ready to let go of their voice plans. In fact, some new smartphone contracts don’t provide the option of reducing voice minutes to save money, let alone giving up voice service altogether. The two dominant wireless carriers, Verizon and AT&T, now bundle unlimited minutes and texting with tiered data service plans for smartphones (though not tablets). This allows the carriers to hang on to relatively lucrative revenue streams from lower-bandwidth voice networks for as long as possible, even while charging more for data use. It also lowers the incentive to adopt mobile talking and chatting apps.  But even without a financial incentive, the features that come with communicating over data networks are compelling. Suddenly, rather than just talking with my ear to the handset, I could open up a face-to-face video call, reach out to a Facebook contact whose number I don’t have, send a friend my current location while talking, or forward a photo or message that self-destructs in a few seconds via the privacy-protecting app SnapChat. There will be more innovations to come, whether network carriers like it or not—though they do have some power to slow the adoption of mobile VoIP services, says Susan Crawford, a former communications policy advisor to President Obama. For example, they could discourage video calling with burdensome data overage fees—or block such services outright, as AT&T tried to do with Apple’s Facetime video-chat app last year. “Phone calls have been the same way for 100 years,” says Tim Tuttle, founder of Expect Labs in San Francisco. “Carriers have controlled the network, and there’s been no ability to build technologies on top of it.” Tuttle’s startup is building a calling app, first for iPad, that will listen in on a conversation and, like Apple’s personal assistant Siri, recognize key terms to pull up information that is relevant to the ongoing discussion, such as movie times or a phone contact. The company also plans to sell a technology platform designed to help employees collaborate on documents while talking on their phones.  Rebtel CEO Andreas Bernstrom says he would like to see someone devise a way to make calls across different mobile voice-over-IP services so that a Rebtel user could, for example, call a Skype user. The company recently released a developer platform so that any app can use its calling technology.  I might be willing to forgo a voice plan one day. But the replacement features would have to be a little more reliable and compatible with one another, and there’d have to be some savings involved. I have faith that the first two things will happen, but as Crawford told me, the dominant network carriers will find ways to make sure talk doesn’t get too cheap.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/down-with-debt-mass-mutual/,"Want $20,000 in Student Debt Relief? Craft a Very Creative Tweet","The average graduate of a four-year university leaves school with $26,600 in student debt, according to the Project on Student Debt. In an effort to fight the growing debt trend, MassMutual launched ""Down With Debt"" on Monday, a Facebook campaign that will relieve one lucky young adult of some loan burden — while teaching all fans some important financial planning tips. MassMutual will award one Facebook user with $20,000 for debt relief for liking the campaign's page and writing a creative, 140-character (tweet length) explanation of how they plan to reduce their debt. ""MassMutual recognizes that new graduates and young professionals in today’s world face big financial challenges,"" said Tara Reynolds, MassMutual's corporate vice president.  ""As a result, we created 'Down with Debt' to help people learn about effective ways to conquer their loans and take smart first steps in building a secure financial future."" SEE ALSO: Find Scholarships for College, Student Loans With These Websites
 MassMutual plans to use the Facebook campaign as an opportunity to teach America's youth about planning for their futures, with tips such as: pay with cash, not credit, avoid buying luxury goods, and budget. Down With Debt runs through Feb. 14.  College loan debt now surpasses auto and home loans in the U.S., with more than $1 trillion owed by graduates, according to the U.S. Department of Education and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Project on Student Debt notes that 66% of U.S. higher education students now take out loans, explaining in part how the overall debt burden has gotten so substantial.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/dublin-radio-show-on-air-suicide/,Radio Show's On-Air Suicide Call Divides Audience,"A Dublin radio station is under fire after its handling of an on-air suicide call that lasted more than one hour and trended on Twitter in Ireland. The caller, identified as Jay, eventually came down from the bridge he was standing on when he called the radio talk show and demanded to be put on air. While the nightly FM104 Phoneshow was being broadcast, alarmed listeners across Dublin tuned in as the caller informed host Jeremy Dixon that he was standing on the ledge of an overpass, holding a knife. As Dixon attempted to talk the man down on air, the Irish police force, known as the Gardai, were called to the scene. So were the man's parents. Traffic was halted. According to reports, the man could be heard yelling angrily at the police to stay off the bridge. ""I'm not qualified to deal with this,"" stated a clearly emotional Dixon while the call aired. Though the caller eventually hung up, around midnight he was talked down from the bridge. The incident caused the hashtag #FM104 to trend in Ireland on Twitter, and the subsequent publicity left listeners squarely divided over the incident, flooding the radio station with complaints. ""#FM104 kept a caller who was threatening suicide on air for an HOUR & even went to ad break during?"" read one typical reaction. ""Distasteful & voyeuristic."" But others sided with the studio, arguing that airing the call was the responsible thing: ""Imagine what could have happened if they said no?"" Reports on Twitter alleged that the caller had threatened suicide at this same bridge four times within the previous month, and that the radio station had not actually halted his behavior. At the center of the controversy, Dixon, who tweeted that he was ""completely drained"" after the night, stated the following morning that the radio had ""no other way to deal with"" the call but to air it: He wanted to talk to FM104. He didn’t ring anybody else, he didn’t ring his family, he rang FM104. … When someone rings and they feel as desperate and that, there is only one thing to do and that is to talk to them. … Hopefully it has worked.
 Still, criticism of the decision to air the call remained fierce—especially for its decision to take an ad break in the middle of the call. Irish Parliament member Finian McGrath called the station ""grossly irresponsible."" This smacks of what happened recently to those crank call radio DJs in Australia and the nurse in the UK. No lessons learned #fm104 — Patrick Abbott (@patrickabbott) January 11, 2013 #fm104 had NO choice in broadcasting that call. They risked their license for it. He threatened suicide if they didn't! WHAT WOULD YOU DO?! — erin large (@erinmollylarge) January 11, 2013 Norah Bohan, cofounder of Depression Hurts Ireland, tweeted that companies need a strategy in place for crisis management of this kind. FM104 confirmed after the incident that its staff would receive training for how to respond to suicidal behavior. Photo courtesy of Flickr, cogdogblog

In an example of reverse product placement, NBC Universal teamed up with Staples unit Quill in 2011 to create a Dunder Mifflin line of paper products. Until then, the company was a fictional entity that existed only on the U.S. version of The Office. Apparently, the venture has been successful: In November, the company began expanding into tissues, disposable cups, notepads and markers, among other products.  Now the brand is making its first foray into TV advertising. Dunder Mifflin has teamed up with crowdsourcing platform Tongal to create the ad.  On Monday, Tongal started soliciting bids for the project. The requirement for the ad is pretty broad, though it has to prominently mention the brand, Quill.com and include a plug for The Office at the end. The producers of The Office will also be reviewing the entries.  The creator of the winning ad will receive $15,000. The ad will run on local TV in Scranton during the Super Bowl. (Scranton, of course, is the headquarters for Dunder Mifflin in the show.) The posting comes on the same day Tongal received $15 million in funding from a private equity firm.

Today Mashable is pleased to offer ""Party Kids"" as a stream and free download. The song will be accompanied by a video in the coming weeks, which the band is teasing via its Cinemagram account.  Created with cinemagr.am  Created with cinemagr.am Ford and her band have been a favorite of ours since 2011, when they released their debut, Dirty Radio.  We caught up briefly with the band over email in advance of the new album. Mashable: How did you guys get so into Cinemagram? Ford: We have always enjoyed those GIFs online where you are limited to your use of video data. Art is something that thrives on limitations so only having 3 or 4 seconds of video is great and simple. We enjoy using it and it is exciting to see possibilities everywhere. You've suggested that your generation needs more freedom and honesty. Is the Internet helping or hurting that cause? How so? The ease and functionality of today's smartphones make it so apparent for you and your friends to see what you had for breakfast or what you did for the holidays or how drunk you were last Friday, which can all be quite fascinating and true. But it is sort of hard to say what is honest because you could have 90% of the Cinemagrams be of Jeff [Munger, the band's guitarist] eating fried chicken, so everyone thinks he eats a ton of fried chicken, but really it is a much smaller percentage in daily life. As time goes on people are splitting the difference between really being honest with themselves and how they would like to be perceived by their online reputation. Are there any artists or bands you particularly admire for their social media presence? Mac DeMarco's Facebook page is littered with great little footage from the road and online tidbits that are really endearing and fun to watch. Give us one prediction for an upcoming trend in digital music. We are definitely persuaded by convenience so I do see the quality in wireless transmission to stereos getting better. But we all listen to records at home and hopefully more people will believe in a pure signal path like record grooves to thick speaker wires and good speakers. Do you have any hopes or aspirations for the band or the album in 2013? We don't really have any expectations for the upcoming album, we just hope that people enjoy what we have made and come to the shows so they can dance and smile and make love so we can continue making art how we like to.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/fan-half-court-shot/,Fan's Occult Half-Court Shot Must Be Seen to Be Believed," There's a glitch in the Matrix down south in Atlanta, Ga. How do we know this? Thanks to an occult moment that happened during a promotion at an NBA game. A fan named Kevin was given a chance to win $1,000 by hitting a half-court shot during a break in play between a Jazz-Hawks contest this Saturday. Kevin elected to go with the one-handed, over-handed, quarterback-style toss but the end result was even more incredible than any swish. As you see above, the ball lands squarely on the back of the rim without bouncing or rolling around.  SEE ALSO: The Incredible Story of a 5-Foot-5 Dunking Sensation
 The ball just sits there for a few full seconds until the contest's MC hops up to pull the net and jostle it loose. Things get even weirder as the ball finally falls through the room to applause from an audience of stunned sports fans.  At the end of the video, the announcer seems to say that Kevin has indeed won his $1,000, despite the shot's rather bizarre circumstances.  Do you think it should have counted?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/first-4k-channel/,World's First 4K TV Channel Goes Live,"Hot on the heels of CES, where 4K TVs stole the show, comes news that the world's first 4K TV channel is now live in Europe. Eutelsat, a French-based satellite provider, has just begun broadcasting in 4K on a demo channel. 4K, also called ""Ultra HD,"" has four times the resolution of current high-def broadcasts. The format doubles the pixel count in both directions, which can result in a much sharper picture at larger screen sizes. While 4K TVs made headlines at CES, there is currently very little native 4K content, leaving the super-sharp TVs upconverting lower-resolution video most of the time. Eutelsat's 4K channel aims to point the way toward changing that. The provider says 4K doesn't require any modification to its systems, although if you're a customer you'll obviously need a 4K TV and the 4K-capable receiver to see the broadcasts at full resolution (Eutelsat says ""some terrestrial systems"" won't be able to handle them). SEE ALSO: Feast Your Eyes on the Epic Panasonic 4K OLED TV
 The channel is intended to serve as a showcase for the new format, so presumably the programming will consist of various demo reel, but no full-length 4K content. Eutelsat also hopes the rollout of 4K will accelerate plans to create a compression standard for the format. Energized by all the 4K news coming out of CES, the race is clearly on make the format a reality. Sony has also begun answering the question surrounding 4K content, implementing plans to provide its 4K TV customers with several movies as well as a content distribution system this summer. Bear in mind, however, the extra pixels of 4K won't make much of a difference at smaller screen sizes. If viewed at normal viewing distances, today's 1080p TVs are already so sharp that the human eye can't discern individual pixels. The benefits of 4K are clear only for larger screens.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/getglue-viggle-merger-canceled/,GetGlue-Viggle Merger Canceled,"Story Updated 1/14/13 9:11 P.M. Television check-in app GetGlue is no longer merging with Viggle, the startup announced in a blog post Sunday. ""The two companies remain friendly and think highly of each other,"" GetGlue said, adding that it is ""moving forward as an independent company."" In an unexpected move, Viggle acquired GetGlue for $73 million last November. The three-year-old startup, which describes itself as a ""loyalty program for television,"" paid $25 million in cash and 48.3 million shares of stock for its competitor. Commentators expressed surprise at the acquisition, as Viggle is a much newer and lesser-known brand. GetGlue, which launched in 2007, boasts 3.2 million registered users, while Viggle has 1.2 million. One reason for the failed merger may be Viggle's precarious financial situation. The company reported a loss of $96.5 million on revenues of $1.7 million in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, according to a 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. At the time of the acquisition, Viggle president and COO Greg Consiglio told Mashable that the deal would only close if it successfully raised $60 million in debt financing.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/getty-images-get-social-with-powerful-new-trending-tool/,Getty Images Get Social With Powerful New Trending Tool,"With its extensive library of promo photos from major news events and exotic locations around the world, Getty Images could one day become a force on social media. That day may, in fact, come sooner than later.  The company on Monday launched something called ""The Feed by Getty Images,"" which essentially piggybacks off Twitter's API to identify trending topics on social media then push out Getty photos that match those conversations. For major news, sports and entertainment in particular, this could launch a much more powerful presence for and greater awareness of Getty on social media.  Getty produces more than 10,000 images per day and many of the best ones will find their way to Getty's various Facebook pages, the @FeedMeGetty Twitter handle and a gateway page at thefeed.gettyimages.com. On Twitter for example, the company will post images of trending topics each hour, then increase that output when major news breaks or big events take place. On The Feed website, meanwhile, users will also be able to look at photos of trending topics sorted by region. 
 
Yvonne Chien, the company's senior vice president of marketing, says the move's goals are twofold — to drive more Getty subscriptions and image purchases, as well as elevate the brand's profile and visibility with normal Internet surfers simply hungry for visual content to look at.  ""There is undoubtedly a desire from both business customers and consumers alike to see the newest and most exciting images,"" Chen told Mashable in an email. ""The Feed was built to open up ways for Getty Images’ content to be showcased through today’s top social media networks, enable real-time engagement and create new experiences. We looked to see whether other visual content providers had this type of capability, automatically populating their content into social media using trending algorithms, and did not see any similar brands doing this anywhere else."" Chen says the project has been in the works for four months, and that it will likely soon expand to include video and additional social platforms.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/hacker-olympics/,Hacker Olympics Draws Top Students to Silicon Valley,"Imagine a place where computer nerds are revered like jocks and rockstars. That was San Francisco this past weekend. A carefully selected group of 100 college students flocked to the Bay Area to powwow with veterans of the famed tech startup scene. The students came for an all-expense paid weekend to compete in the inaugural run of the ""University Hacker Olympics.""   One of the event's organizers, Ahmed Siddiqui, called it the ""largest university hackathon ever held."" ""Our whole goal is to get the best technical minds to the Bay Area and connect them with awesome startups and companies,"" Siddiqui told Mashable. Monica Poletti, a 19-year-old sophomore at North Carolina State, was a member of the winning team. Working with mentors from Pinterest, Poletti and five other students — from Brown, Tufts and Ohio State — designed a visually appealing and functional collaborative workspace.  The tool, called ""Project Yarn,"" is intended to help plan trips, parties and other events. Poletti summed up the project as a cross between Google Docs and a virtual bulletin board. It allows multiple users to work on the board in real time. ""I don't know if we expected it to win, but we all really liked what it could do,"" Poletti told Mashable. ""I learned so much out here in just two days; it was incredible."" Despite the known gender divide in the tech world, the six members of Poletti's team were divided equally by gender. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, women comprised less than a quarter of the country's STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workforce in 2009.  Poletti said this group had the highest ratio of females to males of any collaborative programming project she has ever worked on.

 Below is a screenshot of a Project Yarn story board, on which users planned a cross-country motocycle trip.  SignalFire, an organization based in San Francisco, hosted the competition, which was sponsored by tech companies large and small, from Google to Nature Box and many more. Prior to the event, companies brainstormed ideas. When the students arrived, they divided into teams. The companies then pitched their ideas to the student teams who selected which ones they wanted to pursue. ""It's like doing recruiting without resumes,"" Siddiqui said. ""There's a huge problem of getting developers out here in the valley."" The students went through a rigorous screening process to win the chance to compete. More than 500 students from about 30 colleges and universities signed up for online coding challenges during November.  Drawing from the top performers in the coding challenge, SignalFire reps selected a final pool of 100 hacker olympiads, based on their previous experience and LinkedIn profiles. After about 24 hours of programming by the students and their mentors, a panel of judges selected the top three groups, which then attended a VIP dinner, accompanied by a group of tech CEOs. There, the contest winner was announced. In addition to the networking opportunity, the top three teams also won Amazon Web Services credit packages.

 Raj Mukherjee, vice president and general manager of products for GoDaddy, participated in the competition as a judge. He called Project Yarn a ""a cool application with an awesome front end.""  ""I was frankly blown over by the quality of the students that participated in the hackathon,"" Mukherjee told Mashable. All parties — organizers, sponsors and students — seemed to agree that the University Hacker Olympics was a success. On behalf of SignalFire, Siddiqui said the company hopes to make this a bi-annual tradition, including even more colleges and universities in the future. Stay tuned, hackers. Next time, it could be you who brings home the gold.   Images courtesy of Flickr, Scorpions and Centaurs, and Monica Poletti/Project Yarn "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/how-to-land-a-job-at-birchbox/,How to Land a Job at Birchbox,"Looking to start your dream job in 2013? Our new Dream Job series will give you an upper hand. We're talking to recruiters at top tech companies like Spotify and Kickstarter to get the behind-the-scenes knowledge about what it takes to get a gig. Don't know much about Birchbox? The company launched in 2010 and has received $11.9 million in funding to date. The discovery commerce platform has 140 employees (100 in New York, the rest in London, Paris and Barcelona) who surprise and delight more than 300,000 subscribers every month with a box full of high-end samples that you can buy on the Birchbox website. (And no, this startup's not just for ladies — its bright new digs are indicative of the ""de-pinking"" of Birchbox. Haven't you see Birchbox Man?) This week, we spoke with Melissa Enbar, director of recruiting at Birchbox. Read on to find out how to score a gig.  The Openings: ""We have tons of jobs open,"" says Enbar. Indeed, the company — which just moved into a new space — has many open desks waiting for you to fill them, both for full-time employees and interns. A small sample of what's available at Birchbox: Graphic Designer (NYC) Merchandising Marketing and Inside Sales Manager (NYC) Social Media Associate (NYC) Software Engineer (NYC) Director of Engineering (NYC) Technical Product Manager (London) PR Manager (London) The team that's ""always growing"" and set to grow at a rapid pace in coming months is the brand partnerships team, which collaborates with Birchbox's brand partners to select the products that will be sampled and sold. Since ""editorial is a huge component of our business,"" that team is always looking for solid writers, too.  Then, of course, there's the team that builds and maintains the site and shop. ""We're often categorized as a beauty company, but really, we're changing ecommerce, we're doing some really interesting things around personalization and box allocation — we're really tech-enabled,"" says Enbar. The tech team is headed up by CTO Liz Crawford (yes, a woman!), and that team is 38% female. Birchboxers describe the company as a ""discovery commerce company,"" so there's a lot of data being used to solve interesting problems. ""We're a very numbers-driven business,"" explains Enbar. Consequently, there are analyst positions in multiple departments, including ecommerce and brand marketing. The operations and customer service team is the group that interfaces with Birchbox customers, but each person on the team also has a side project in another area of the company, says Enbar. ""They’re our tie to our customers, and the information they know is vital,"" explains Enbar, adding that these teammates ""work on projects with other teams to keep those teams connected to our customers."" Operations member Loren works on the Birchbloggers program, communicating with bloggers about new developments at Birchbox, while a few other members of the Operations team gather data, insights and customer feedback for monthly presentations to the Beauty Partnerships to help determine what products should be sent to subscribers. These side projects help to make the brand more cohesive and ensure that Birchbox is giving its subscribers what they want. U.S. jobs can be found here, and international positions are here.  The Application Process: While the application process varies based on the position and level, the first step is usually a phone interview. Then there are in-person interviews, during which you should expect to meet with more than just your future department. ""Because we have a collaborative work environment, we also do cross-team interviews. In almost every interview process candidates meet someone from another team who they will work closely with on the job,"" says Enbar. ""That's really important to us — one of our values is 'one team,' so everything we do is collaborative."" There are usually two or three rounds of interviews, and there's typically a department-specific assessment at some point during the process. For example, the tech team's main aim is to assess a candidates fundamental skills, not their knowledge of any specific technology or framework.  Software engineer applicants typically are asked to write code for algorithmic problems on a white board, tackle an object-oriented design problem, discuss a software architecture problem in detail, and answer some relational database questions. ""These questions allow us to understand how candidates think and understand their strengths,"" says Enbar. The social media team, on the other hand, asks candidates to evaluate what Birchbox is already doing and develop ideas for how to improve the strategy. During the final round of interviews, everyone meets with either Katia or Hayley — ""It's really important to us that people coming onboard understand the mission, the vision, who we are as a company, where we're headed,"" says Enbar.  The Ideal Candidate: When sifting through resumes, Enbar says a few things jump out at her. She's intrigued by people who've done interesting things and have been leaders in previous positions, people with interesting extracurriculars, and people who are passionate about the business model. If you haven't worked in beauty, you need not worry — that experience is a nice-to-have, but not a must (if it is a must, it'll say so in the job description). The brand has grown to have Birchbox Man and shipped a limited-edition home box, so ""as we grow, lifestyle is a big part of the equation,"" says Kelly Herman, senior PR manager. ""The big picture understanding of who we are, discovery retail and what that means — that's important to us,"" says Enbar. When reviewing applications in the Resumator (the application platform), Enbar says the recruiting team really looks at the person as a whole — their personality, their skills, how much research they've done on Birchbox. But the company also has values that define Birchbox, so applicants are measured against those values. SEE ALSO: Beauty Delivered: How Birchbox Is Disrupting the Cosmetics Industry
 Perks of the Job & Company Culture: ""In general, we're a fun, energetic environment,"" says Enbar. There are weekday workouts (a whole wall is devoted to it), weekly company meetings, Thursday breakfasts, hot lunches and recreational activities, like the Tough Mudder. Plus, everyone gets a free subscription to Birchbox, a discount on all products and a chunk of money to spend in the Birchbox shop. On day one, you get a Birchbox hoodie, and after one year with the company, you get a fresh pair of custom sneaks. The company offers medical, dental and vision, and Birchbox offers options to be covered 100%.  As a fun, young startup Birchbox does mixers with other startups in the area, like Tumblr, Venmo and Lot18. The company believes in celebrating its wins, so there are a lot of celebrations in the office (and for big occasions, there's usually some sort of swag). ""One of the things that differentiates us is that people come here because they love the business, they love the changes we're making, and they want to work on something that people love,"" says Enbar. ""We care about our customers, and we listen to them."" And Birchbox leadership listens to the team, too. Day to day, you'll see founders Katia and Hayley in cubes with everyone else, accessible and happy to chat with you about the company.  The best part about working here is:
 ""Being part of a movement to change how people discover and buy products. And we have great snacks."" - Deena Bahri, VP of Marketing ""The friends you'll make and the fun you'll have - while working. This amazing company attracts incredible team members - and our passion for the work is contagious."" - Paulina Anderson, Lead Operations Associate ""Everyone's voice is heard. Birchbox is a place where you can see your own ideas incorporated into what the company is doing and brought to fruition.  If you have an idea for how our processes and strategy can be enhanced or improved, you are encouraged to bring it up and see it through."" - Eric Neher, Director, Merchandising & Marketing When I started working here, I was surprised by... ""The ratio of women to men, higher than I am used to coming from a computer science background. For example xoxo is a normal email sign-off."" -  Liz Crawford, CTO ""The parties! Birchboxers really know how to have a good time. It is so rewarding to be able to relax and unwind with the same people you work so hard with everyday!"" - Charlie Cooper, Creative Production Manager Don't bother applying if... ""You're not ready to roll your sleeves up and get to work.  I truly believe we have the hardest working team in NYC.  Every person here feels ownership over what they are doing and also over the growth and success of the company so we are all motivated to work very hard every day."" - Eric Neher, Director, Merchandising & Marketing ""You don't like a good challenge, the majority of what we do at Birchbox is problem solving. Speedy but efficient problem solving, it keeps you on your toes!"" - Charlie Cooper, Creative Production Manager ""You can't go with the flow. We're constantly reinventing and iterating on ideas as we go! It's exhilarating, but means you're best suited for the environment if you're willing to be flexible."" - Candace Chan, Editor & Blog Manager "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/illumiroom-microsoft/,IllumiRoom Turns Your Entire Living Room Into a TV Screen," Our TV sets are getting bigger and bigger and with ever greater resolutions. But what if the screen isn't enough anymore though? That's the idea behind Microsoft's latest idea, a technology that turns the room around your TV into an extension of it.  IllumiRoom uses a Kinect sensor and a projector ""to blur the lines between on-screen content and the environment we live in allowing us to combine our virtual and physical worlds,"" as Microsoft puts it the project's official site. Basically, the Kinect maps its surrounding environment, noticing the shape and distance of furniture and shelves, and then tweaks the images that are going to be projected so that they match the room.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/instagram-changes/,11 Things We'd Change About Instagram,"Currently, we rely on Intagram's auto-enhance tool for a generic color and shadow boost. But imagine the fun we could have if Instagram allowed its users to manually adjust brightness and contrast.  We love tilt-shift, really we do. But sometimes Instagram's stock circle and rectangle shapes can be a little limiting. We'd like to be able to create a custom blur, similar to the lasso tool on Photoshop. Sometimes our hands are too shaky to capture a level photo. Wouldn't it be great if you could rotate your photo one degree at a time, versus the 90-degree option now offered on Instagram?  Note: Users would have to adjust the rotation before cropping, as exposed corners can quickly compromise the clean frame of the photo. We're not entirely sure why, but Instagram rewards iPhone users with one tool Android owners cannot enjoy: the Twitter share. The Instagram iPhone app (left) allows users to tweet others' photos, while the Android app (right) only lets users flag photos as inappropriate. What gives? OK Instagram, we're ready for better search functionality. At the moment, we can only search by user or hashtag, not by keyword. We're surprised Instagram stands so resolutely behind the Twitter-esque hashtag, especially given the two companies' recent feud.  We forge friendships and professional relationships over social media all the time. And sometimes, those platforms are the best places to communicate. Why not implement a messaging system on Instagram? Users would be able to privately contact others who mutually follow them, similar to a Twitter direct message. Did you know you can delete comments on Instagram? Many users are unaware of this feature, perhaps because comment moderation is hard to access. To delete your comments or other users' comments on your photos, you have to tap the ""Comment"" button on a photo, as if you planned to add a comment. Then swipe one of the existing comments to the right. Depending whether you're on Android or iOS, you'll need to tap the pencil or the trash can, respectively.  Whew, that was a mouthful. We wish it was simpler.  We tested it. Sure enough, once a user posts an Instagram to Facebook, the photo's quality is compromised. Check out that grain. Ick. Instagram launched Photo Maps in summer 2012. It was the company's answer to browsing old photos, only it chose to sort images by location vs. time.  However, despite the fact that some users enabled geo-location data, they are unable to go back and tag Instagram photos by location. Instagram requires that users decide how to tag their photos before they've even uploaded them. We'd like to be able to change our minds, thank you very much! What's the deal with Instagram likes on the web? You can't pull up or scroll to view who has liked a photo -- besides the first six people, that is. Bug? Kiss and make up, Twitter and Instagram! We miss the cross-platform compatibility, not to mention our more colorful Twitter feeds.  Instagram underwent a healthy chunk of change in 2012, what with the Facebook acquisition, the Twitter feud, a major app overhaul and a robust web presence. But as always, we're never satisfied.   SEE ALSO: The Beginner's Guide to Instagram
 The social platform could stand to make a few more renovations. And we're here to point them out — within reason. We avoided major changes that would compromise Instagram's unique and successful vision, which revolves around mobile-exclusive tools and barriers to entry that discourage copyright violations. That being said, these changes would make the user experience a whole lot more pleasant. If given the chance, what would you change about Instagram? Share your suggestions and gripes in the comments below.  Photo composite courtesy of Stephanie Buck. "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/justin-timberlake-suit-and-tie-jay-z/,Justin Timberlake Returns With 'Suit and Tie' Single Featuring Jay-Z,"After teasing a musical comeback several days ago, singer Justin Timberlake unleashed a new song featuring Jay-Z on Sunday night.  ""Suit and Tie,"" which is now available on iTunes, marks Timberlake's first song as a lead artist since 2006's FutureSex/LoveSounds. He was featured on Madonna's ""4 Minutes"" in 2008.  ""Suit and Tie"" is the lead single from The 20/20 Experience, an album title he also revealed Sunday in an open letter to fans (see below). He says the album will come out this year. SEE ALSO: Listen to the World Premiere of Destiny's Child's 'Nuclear'
 Timberlake produced his latest track with Timbaland and J-ROC. They also co-wrote the song with Jay-Z and James Flauntleroy. Timberlake tweeted to announce ""Suit and Tie."" The announcement includes a link that leads his 15.4 million followers to Countdown.JustinTimberlake.com, a website he teased Jan. 10. Can't wait. Too stoked! #SuitAndTie #JT2013 tmbr.lk/suitandtie — Justin Timberlake(@jtimberlake) January 14, 2013 Listen to the new song here or in the link within the tweet.  The website now includes this open letter from Timberlake to his fans: I hope this gets to you the right way. It's the only way I know to do it. Some people may criticize me for the last 3 days. But it was fun, right?? Right?!?! Besides, I'd rather speak directly to all of you. And, who can knock me for having a little bit of fun with it? Well... No more teasing. Although, it was A LOT of fun. (Did I mention that I'm having fun with this?? Ha!) *Makes a serious face* This year is an exciting one for me. As you probably have heard through the ""grapevine,"" I'm gearing up for a big 2013. Back in June of last year, I quietly started working on what is now, my next journey with that thing I love called MUSIC. The inspiration for this really came out of the blue and to be honest, I didn't expect anything out of it. I just went into the studio and started playing around with some sounds and songs. It was probably the best time I've had in my career... Just creating with no rules and/or end goal in mind and really enjoying the process. What I came up with is something I couldn't be more excited about! It is full of inspiration that I grew up listening to and some newfound muses that I've discovered along the way. I'm calling it ""The 20/20 Experience,"" and it's coming out this year. I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed making it. That's all I'm giving you for now... I know, I know! Again, with the teasing!!! Get ready. This is going to be fun (well, at least it is for me). "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/lance-armstrong-admits-peds-oprah/,Has Lance Armstrong's Doping Saga Finally Come to an End?,"Over the past several months, the long and winding road toward what most assume will be Lance Armstrong's eventual admittance of using performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) to win the Tour de France a record number of times has played out largely online.  Critics and supporters have, of course, reacted to the controversy on Twitter and other social networks with statements of vitriolic condemnation and steadfast support. But Armstrong himself has also used social media to send cryptic, even boastful, messages to followers. And perhaps the most damning piece of the case against Armstrong was posted online in October.  But the drawn out repetitions of accusation and denial will finally reach an end this week with Armstrong admitting PED use in an interview with Oprah Winfrey scheduled to air on Thursday, according to the Associated Press. The interview was taped on Monday but the AP cites ""a person familiar with the situation"" as confirming Armstrong's forthcoming confession. Armstrong has long been suspected by media, competing cyclists and other fans of relying on PEDs to win a record seven Tour de France titles from 1999 through 2005. He has steadfastly denied all accusations over the years, but Internet users reacted in shock last August when he posted an online statement staying he would end his years-long contention of doping charges by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) but admit no wrongdoing.  ""I am finished with this nonsense,"" Armstrong's statement defiantly declared. The next day he tweeted that donations to his Livestrong Foundation had soared to a 25-fold increase since his announcement. Armstrong founded Livestrong in 1997 after battling testicular cancer to help others struggling with cancer. Livestrong's record of good work and strong public image further clouded the debate over the significance of Armstrong's alleged PED use.  Some six weeks later, however, Armstrong and his supporters were hit with another bombshell when former Tour de France teammate George Hincapie used a tweet and post to his official website to admit for the first time that he took performance enhancing drugs and named names of other dopers for investigators. The USADA then released hundreds of pages of testimony from 11 of Armstrong's former riding mates, detailing PED use by the team.  Later in October, Armstrong finally acknowledged the mounting evidence and momentum against him in a fitting move for the social media age: by removing his claim to seven Tour de France titles from his Twitter bio. He struck a more defiant tone in November, however, by posting a photo of himself reclining while surrounded by his seven Tour-winning jerseys accompanied by the expertly trolling caption, ""Back in Austin and just layin' around...""  That image went viral with sports fans online, gaining more than 300,000 views on the multimedia-sharing network Mobli — in which, it just so happens, he's an investor.  Assuming Armstrong cops to doping this week, does that make him a disgrace — or do his achievements still outweigh everything else? Give us your take in the comments.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/maltreated-girls-risky-online-behavior/,Study: Maltreated Girls More Likely to Engage in Risky Online Behavior,"A note to parents: parental control software doesn't protect your daughters from engaging in risky online behavior as much as ""quality parenting,"" and monitoring her online activities yourself.  Researchers from the University of Cincinnati released a report on Monday in Pediatrics about the online behaviors of teenage girls and factors that increased their risk of engaging in potentially dangerous, or at least inappropriate behavior.   The study followed the online behavior of 251 teenage girls, ages 14 to 17, for 12-16 months in 2008 when the hot social network was MySpace. Their offline behavior was also monitored, in addition to how each teen was parented.  Researchers wanted to see if girls who were maltreated (neglected, or physically or sexually abused) were more likely to engage in dangerous behaviors. Of the 251 girls in the study, 130 experienced ""substantiated maltreatment"" and 121 of whom were demographically matched comparison girls who reported no maltreatment. However, all subjects were considered ""high risk.""   SEE ALSO: Nearly Half of Teen Internet Users Have Lied About Their Age [INFOGRAPHIC]  Girls who were maltreated were more likely to have exposure to sexual content online, create ""high-risk social networking profiles,"" and receive online sexual solicitations. And 30% of the teens said they've met a stranger in person after chatting online.  ""Maltreatment, adolescent behavioral problems, and low cognitive ability were uniquely associated with high-risk Internet behaviors,"" the study notes.  But girls whose parents monitored their behavior and encouraged open communication reduced the association between a teen's risk factors and risky online behaviors.  The study suggests pediatric practitioners advise parents on media literacy and encourage greater involvement in their kids' social media lives.  ""Internet safety and sex education programs should highlight the implications for provocative self-presentations, offer skills for handling sexual solicitations,"" the study concludes.

The entertainment entities on Monday announced the U.S. programming agreements, which also include Warner Bros. Animation's Green Lantern. TNT's Dallas will arrive in 2014.  Netflix's Cartoon Network selection will include Adventure Time, Ben 10 (pictured), Regular Show and Johnny Bravo.

 The news comes just one week after Netflix announced it eventually would start streaming eight Warner Bros. shows and possibly more in the future. The slate includes newer shows (Revolution, The Following, Longmire, Political Animals and 666 Park Avenue) and older ones (Chuck, Fringe and The West Wing). It appears Time Warner, the parent company of Turner Broadcasting and Warner Bros., is loosening its once tight grip on the content it previously didn't want streaming on subscription services like Netflix.  ""The industry has evolved so that TV Everywhere and subscription video on-demand services can co-exist with the appropriate windowing strategy, while allowing for more content flexibility to meet consumer demand in the changing digital landscape,"" Deborah Bradley, senior vice president of program acquisitions for Turner Broadcasting, said in a statement.

Commuters in subway stations around the globe were turned into peeping Toms on Sunday, as many unwittingly faced their fellow travelers' underclothes.  Straphangers got an eyeful during the 12th annual No Pants Subway Ride, a prank started in 2002 by Improv Everywhere. The New York City-based group calls themselves a ""prank collective that causes scenes of chaos and joy in public places."" And what could possibly bring more joy than strangers in their underwear?  Thousands participated in more than 25 countries, including China, Australia and Mexico. In Seattle, pranksters braved 37-degree weather sans pants.  There are only two requirements: Take 'em off and keep a straight face. No thongs or other offensive underwear are allowed, but everything else is fair game.  Participants are organized into groups and assigned a specific train car, but can't speak to one another. The first No Pants Subway Ride had just seven men and a pants peddler who later came through the car with a duffle bag. This year, NYC had more than 4,000 bare-bottomed pranksters.  Check out this year's video and take a peek at our gallery, above, of pants-less people around the world.   Thumbnail image via Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/nra-shooter-game/,NRA Releases iPhone Shooter Game One Month After Sandy Hook,"The National Rifle Association released on Monday a first-person shooter for the iPhone and iPad — one month to the day after a tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., left 26 dead. The game, ""NRA: Practice Range,"" has two modes. The first, a ""Safety, Training and Education"" section, has ""2nd Amendment newsfeeds, gun law information centers and educational materials that you can access anywhere, anytime,"" according to the game's iTunes description. The second is ""Target Practice,"" which is designed to instill ""safe and responsible ownership through fun challenges and realistic simulations."" Target Practice has nine firearms (including an unlockable AK-47 and an MK-11 sniper rifle) and three shooting ranges.  Between shooting sessions, players are presented with various gun safety tips, including ""always keep the gun pointed in a safe direction.""  Practice Range's release comes with a degree of irony: NRA chief Wayne LaPierre blasted violent video games in the organization's post-Sandy Hook press conference. During that conference, LaPierre accused ""vicious violent video games, with names like Bulletstorm, Grand Theft Auto, Mortal Kombat, and Splatterhouse"" of contributing to a violent society.  SEE ALSO: Joe Biden Asked Not to Investigate Violent Video Games
 Admittedly, Practice Range is one of the least violent iOS games involving guns in the App Store: Players shoot either clay disks or targets that almost, but not quite, look like human beings. The game was developed by MEDL Mobile, makers of other titles including ""Shotgun Free,"" which invites players to ""unleash a high-caliber hell storm."" NRA: Practice Range is rated appropriate for players ages four and older. Photos courtesy the National Rifle Association "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/rha-sci-fi-short/,22-Year-Old's Sci-Fi Digital Short Gets Hollywood's Attention,"Science fiction movies are among the hardest and most expensive films to make in Hollywood. You need a big budget and a lot of people working on it. But not if you're Kaleb Lechowski. The 22-year-old German who studies digital film design made his own animated Hollywood-style sci-fi short — and now he's headed to Hollywood.  Lechowski's film, titled R'ha, is a fully computer animated six-minute short that you won't believe was made by just one student. In R'ha, machines rebel against their rulers, an alien species, and force them out of their planet. The short starts with a robot interrogating one of the aliens after the Matrix-style insurrection. Perhaps R'ha's most original element is that there are no humans in sight. The story seems to be only about this alien race and their former servant robots who have turned on them.   Despite being the work of a student, R'ha is so good it's already attracted the attention of Hollywood executives. After seeing Lechowski's creation online, Scott Glassgold, of the managing company IAM Sports & Entertainment, was impressed. ""His work is not only professional, it's extraordinary,"" Glassgold wrote Mashable in an email. ""There are shots in there that look like they are from a 150-million-dollar movie."" Glassgold has experience with science fiction, he sold the shorts Rosa and True Skin to studios last year. Lechowski studies at the Berlin Mediadesign Hochschule. R'ha is his second big project at the school and his first animated 3D short. Lechowski told Mashable that he had the original idea for the story in the summer of 2011. Then, last semester, when he had to develop an animated 3D short for school, he decided he wanted to do a sci-fi video and use the idea he previously had developed.  SEE ALSO: Science Fiction Dreams That Came True in 2012
 Inspired mostly by movies like Matrix and videogames like Half-Life, Lechowski is a big sci-fi fan. He wanted to create a science fiction short because he likes the freedom that the genre allows. In sci-fi ""you can create almost anything, like creatures, machines, you can create worlds, you can create basically everything,"" Lechowski told Mashable in a Skype interview.   In 2011 he wrote down his ideas and when he started his school project he scribbled down some more ideas, doing drawings of the creatures he wanted to animate, and then he simply started working on his computer. Lechowski says he actually prefers to improvise directly with the program he uses rather than do too many drawings with pen and paper. Apart from having an actor doing the voices, and receiving help with the sound, he did it all by himself. Thanks to his impressive work, Lechowski is now headed to Hollywood. Glassgold, who acts as Lechowski's manager, got in touch with him and offered him a chance to pitch his short and his ideas as a full feature to movie producers. The manager thinks the movie has great potential, not only because of its technical excellence. ""After speaking with him, the world and universe that he has in mind for R'ha is groundbreaking,"" the Glassgold wrote.  The German student will go to Hollywood in a few weeks to meet with executives and see if he can get the financing he needs to turn this into a movie. Lechowski and Glassgold declined to give more details about who they'll meet but Glassgold said they ""are already fielding offers and interest for a feature."" Lechowski said he has some ideas on how to develop the movie, although obviously the rest of R'ha's story isn't decided yet. What he needs now is some help so he doesn't have to keep doing everything on his own, although he jokingly says that could do that too — with a considerable amount of time on his hands. ""It's just a question of time, I think,"" he says. ""If one would say I have 10 years of time to make a full feature out of it, I could do it my own, I guess. But that's not what I want to do."" This wouldn't be the first time that a short becomes a full-featured successful movie. That's what happened with the critically acclaimed District 9, which was adapted from the short Alive in Joburg.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/rim-stock-up-10-percent/,RIM Stock Jumps 10% on BlackBerry 10 Hype,"Investors may have soured a bit on Apple, but they're starting to love Research In Motion. While Apple's stock struggled to stay above the $500 mark Monday, RIM's stock jumped more than 10%, briefly passing $15 a share for the first time since February of last year before ending the day at $14.95. RIM's surge is due in part to investor optimism for the long-awaited launch of the BlackBerry 10 operating system and smartphones, which is set to take place at the end of this month.  Reps from Verizon, AT&T and Sprint confirmed last week that they would support RIM's upcoming BlackBerry 10 smartphones, an early positive sign for the company. What's more, on Monday, the company's VP of developer relations tweeted that RIM received 15,000 BlackBerry 10 app submissions from developers over the weekend.  The company's stock may also have been helped by reports that Apple had cut its iPhone 5 supply orders, suggesting weaker-than-expected demand.  ""There is a lot of speculation that RIM can continue higher, with even more anticipation for the BlackBerry 10 release with the Apple news [Monday],"" Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade, told the Wall Street Journal. ""Investors are betting that, with momentum from Apple slowing, the momentum in RIM shares will pick up."" Hype for the BlackBerry 10 has helped push RIM's stock above the single-digits in recent months, even as the company reported its first ever decline in subscribers in December. The stock has nearly doubled from just under $8 at the end of October to close at just under $15 Monday.   RIMM data by YCharts Image courtesy of Flickr, edans "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/samsung-100-million-galaxy-s-devices/,Samsung Has Sold More Than 100 Million Galaxy S Devices,"Samsung has sold more than 100 million Galaxy S devices, the company has announced.  Samsung reached this milestone in 2 years and 7 months after the launch of the original Samsung Galaxy S back in May 2010.  A big chunk of this success Samsung owes to its Galaxy S III, whose average daily sales are currently 190,000 units. All in all, the company sold 40 million Galaxy S III devices in 7 months. It took 20 months for its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy S II, to reach that same milestone.  For comparison, Apple sold more than 250 million iPhones to date, but it had a big head start, given the first iPhone was launched in June 2007.  Image credit: Samsung "

The huge TV, showcased at CES 2013, sports a 4K resolution, built-in 2.2 channels speakers, a quad-core CPU and Samsung's diamond black panel.  Samsung UHD TV 8559 is priced at 40,000,000 won ($37,872) in Korea, which is quite high compared to some other 4K competitors' offerings, for example Sony's 84-inch XBR-84X900 which costs $25,000.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/sinofsky-iphone/,Former Windows Chief Sinofsky Caught Using an iPhone,"Since leaving Microsoft a couple months ago, Steve Sinofsky has been busying lining up teaching gigs, launching a blog and apparently playing with iPhones. Sinofsky, the longtime Microsoft exec who was in charge of developing Windows 7 and Windows 8, has been caught tweeting from an iPhone multiple times this year by Mark Gurman at 9to5Mac. But it's not as bad as it sounds. Yes, Sinofsky did tweet from an iPhone (as you can see below), but he has also recently tweeted from several other products including Windows 8 devices.  In response to someone asking him on Twitter about his iPhone use Sunday, Sinofsky clarified that he likes to test different products to see what's out there. (For what it's worth, the tweet below was sent from an iPhone as well.) @albertjelica Sure I use an iphone at times. I have a Samsung too that i use.I want to be familiar with the work of all companies. — Steven Sinofsky (@stevesi) January 14, 2013 Later in the day, Sinofsky expanded on this point in response to a blog post from Bijan Sabet, a general partner at Spark Capital: I have owned every iphone released (and every ipad and galaxy and kindle). It is far better to actually use a product day in and day out so before CES I started using it and will use it for a month or so. Just prior I was using my 920.

 Josh Gondelman is an expert when it comes to wit. More often than not, his tweets will leave you wondering why you never thought of that — or at least, how he did. Better known as @FilthyRichmond, Plums' tweets are sarcastic, often raunchy and usually contain a slight southern tinge.  The Richmond-based comedian is consistently funny, tweeting about current events, politics, pop culture and motherhood. Copywriter Bobby Finger is king of hilarious pop culture commentary and GIF-making. He consistently finds the funniest things on the Internet.  His Tumblr is just as enjoyable as his Twitter stream. Mindy Kaling is quite the talker on Twitter. She flirtaciously tweets hilarious quips to friends, just like the characters she plays on film and TV. HelloGiggles co-founder Sophia Rossi takes stereotypical girl thoughts to a new level.  Rossi tweets about fashion, froyo and celebrity gossip in a way that makes you feel like you're at a sleepover party.  If everyone's talking about something on Twitter, Folgelnest will add his own hysterical thoughts to the conversation.  While keeping up with current events and maintaining the Tumblr LOL tag,  Fogelnest stays busy fake retweeting celebrities and brands.  Comedian Chelsea Peretti is a self-proclaimed ""one of the greats.""  When she's not uploading bored, backstage Instagram pictures before stand-up gigs (often opening for Aziz Ansardi), she's tweeting hilarious thoughts about the day-to-day.  If there was a spambot equivalent to the kind of crazy that Clint Eastwood portrays, it'd probably look something like @dril.  His tweets are dark, confusing and maniacal, yet there's something hilarious about them. Sometimes people tweet things so odd you wonder how they even thought of them in the first place.  Enter a mischeivious baby wolf puppy. The account tweets illustrations and queries about who really let the dogs out.  The account will leave you howling, but this puppy's tweets are protected, so request access first.  Anyone with the Twitter handle @fart has a lot to live up to. Hendren has a huge social influence — he trolled Pitbull into getting sent to a Walmart in Alaska, with the help of his friend and Something Awful colleague David Thorpe.  Both users will leave you laughing, or simply asking ""Why?"" — or both. Micallef is known on the web for her amazing, rainbow-colored GIF artwork.  Her funny rants come in short bursts — she is fond of the exclamation point. The person behind @DadBoner — a fictional character named Karl Welzein who narrates his middle-aged chronicles one tweet at a time — was a mystery until College Humor flatly revealed it was comedian Mike Burns.
 Who would've guessed that The Dark Lord was so socially active?  @Lord_Voldemort7 tweets about current events and plays along with hashtag games, often in a way that incorporates Harry Potter culture. If you're a fan of substance abuse-induced comedy, like @DrunkHulk's, then you'll likely appreciate an ""under the influence"" version of Bill Nye.  Though the real Betty White is now on Twitter, her parody counterpart has been tweeting hilarious impersonations since 2010. 
 Imagine an angry, sarcastic, questionably intoxicated Batman tweeting rants about life in Gotham, Robin's impulsive crying and trending news.  Check out this hilarious parody account of the self-proclaimed ""hero Twitter deserves, but not the one it needs."" In Twitter comedy, Kelly Oxford is queen. The mother of three has found success in writing, which was fueled by her social presence. Her children, which she often quotes on Twitter, are also comedically brilliant.
 The luxury of comedy is being able to approach otherwise touchy subjects. The parody account of Helen Keller harmlessly tweets an exaggerated version of what she might have sounded like in the 21st century. Writer Siedell tweets his dry sense of humor in 140-character bursts under the account @badbanana. His deadpan comedy, which often reads like an overworked adman, is consistently funny.  His tweets have also been collected into a book. Uproxx writer Ashley Burns tweets ruthlessly about sports and pop culture. Basically, it's the kind of things most of us were thinking anyway, but he gets to them first. Between sports commentary and topical observations, Burns also shares the best Internet findings in blog, image, GIF or video form.
 Robin McCauley's observational tweets often have a quick, unexpected ends.  She exaggerates her sarcastic views on dieting, pest control and fashion in ways that are borderline true. Julie Klausner's goofy sense of humor has even won over corporate brands, such as Charmin and IAMS. When she's not campaigning to pet the Bush's Baked Beans dog and posing impromptu thoughts with the equally hilarious Billy Eichner, she's tweeting about basset hounds and her cat.  Better known as @IamEnidColeslaw, Charlene is unconventionally funny. She tweets a smorgasbord of unusual thoughts, sometimes in all caps, with just a tinge of feminism. Rob Delaney has become one of the most influential comedians on Twitter. His social reach has even tapped Mitt Romney's campaign.  Recently, he combined his power on Twitter with the self-distribution model of stand-up by delivering his comedy special directly to fans. Megan Amram's unconventional avatar is similar to her raunchy sense of humor. Her tweets are cleverly crafted and often pack quick bursts of unusually funny wordplay and puns.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/sleep-phones-bluetooth/,Listen to Music in Bed Without Disturbing Your Partner," Soundscapes, anyone? Some of us need soothing music to fall asleep, but our partners don't always find the sound of waves crashing over and over as soothing as we do. For people who sleep in the same bed as a significant other, or perhaps have paper-thin walls and roommates, a new product announced at International CES 2013 will help you get some shut-eye without disturbing others.   SleepPhones are a soft headband that you wear around your head and over your ears — it looks like a sweatband that you'd wear to workout. The headband has headphones in it that you align over your ears. And it's Bluetooth enabled so you can play music or sounds from any Bluetooth enabled device, like your smartphone. SleepPhones have been around for a while, but they required users to plug a cord into their iPod or bedside alarm clock. This wireless version will be available for purchase in April and will retail for $80.  While our tablets and phones have been to blame for keeping us awake, this handy device could prove that not all late-night gadgets cause sleeplessness.  Do you wear headphones while listening to sounds or music at night in order to fall asleep? Which ones do you currently use? Tell us in the comments.   Photo courtesy of iStockphoto, Yuri_Arcurs "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/spreecast-live-video/,Spreecast Is Betting on the Rise of Online Live Video,"The Launchpad is a series that introduces Mashable readers to compelling startups. If you would like to have your startup considered for inclusion, please see the details here. Name: Spreecast One-Liner Pitch: A live online video platform that lets entertainers interact with fans.  Why It's Taking Off: Spreecast boasts a stronger feature set than similar apps and it serves the unique needs of the entertainment industry. One of the contenders for Mashable's recent Innovation Index was HuffPost Live, a product from the news giant that broadcasts live, fresh content nearly 24 hours each day with highlights running late nights and weekends. While it's still in its infancy, industry leaders are quick to point out that the live video hub represents a shift in audience engagement with news content.  Spreecast brings a similar experience to any brand or publication which wants to host a live video session, along with a rich feature set for making the experience interactive for viewers. The site first launched in beta a little over a year ago. When I spoke to founder Jeff Fluhr about the product, he initially compared it to Google+ Hangouts, which understandably falls into the same category of live video and has some of the same features. But, in practice, the two don't necessarily occupy the same space. Where Google+ designed Hangouts to work within its own social network, Spreecast is more of a platform, and Fluhr is quick to point out that users can invite friends to a Spreecast live video through any social identity — Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+ or email.  The feature set of Spreecast is comprehensive, if a bit deceiving, since it allows for public or private video sessions, large and small. There's so many possible ways someone could use it: for a private meeting between team members, as a video-style podcast, as an alternative to a group Skype call for friends or family, and the list goes on. Features include the live chat window next to the video viewer, options to tweet or share to Facebook directly from the viewer and subscribtions to brand channels — all the necessary makings of a social video site.  Nearly all features follow the experience when a Spreecast is embedded elsewhere, so brands or publications can host a Spreecast on their own site. While a Spreecast can be watched by anyone live, it's also captured and can remain online later, with the text chat timed in tandem with the video.  But in practice, the experience of Spreecast is unique from potential competitors such as Join.me, Skype or Google+ — it stands out as an experience ideal for entertainers, from film directors to writers to TV personalities. Recently, Extra hosted ""After Hours"" for its hit show, The Bachelor. Another popular Spreecast was this live chat with the director of Looper. Anderson Cooper experimented with a short ""After Show"" on Spreecast, although it's no longer running.  So, why is Spreecast the epicenter for entertainment and live content made to enhance other live content? First, Fluhr, who is CEO, has a background in live entertainment — he was co-founder of Stubhub, and has found partners in the entertainment space, such as Viacom's VH1.  But most importantly, the experience on Spreecast is conducive to entertainment channels. The design discriminates between who is on the show versus who is watching. It's consistent with how a fan wants to interact with a favorite entertainer, while also being accessible — fans can be added to the conversation easily. Unlike a social network (Google+), users are not trying to grow their personal following or a reputation on Spreecast, so the ease of signing in with whichever social platform is preferred makes sense. The admin controls make a Spreecast feel more highly produced than a Hangout does. As for 2013 plans, Fluhr says they'll be testing possible ways to generate revenue — the platform is currently free. But, revenue could come in the way of charging users for additional features, or selling ads. The company also plans to release apps for iPhone and iPad, but no date is set.  Spreecast's mix of interactive video and discussion brings a lot of potential to the entertainment industry, who will need to take advantage of this new way to engage audiences.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/star-wars-light-speed/,Star Flaws: What the Millennium Falcon Really Saw,"When Star Wars first hit theaters in May 1977, one scene that always had audiences gasping and whooping — according to multiple contemporary reports — came when Han Solo's ship escaped Tatooine and zoomed into a field of suddenly-stretched stars.  ""The sequence where Han Solo's ship hits light speed -– hyperspace –- gets a cheer every single time,"" Rolling Stone's Paul Scanlon told George Lucas that summer. ""People just love it.""  Lucas, ever the drag racer, responded: ""There's nothing like popping the old ship into hyperspace to give you a real thrill.""  In the decades that followed, the stretched-star imagery became a common sci-fi meme.  Well, kid, strap yourself in and prepare for a shock: A fantasy movie that featured lightsabers, vanishing gurus, self-aware droids and seven-foot wookiees got its hyperspace science all wrong. It just took us 35 years to prove it. According to a new study from physicists at the UK's University of Leicester, what the Falcon would have seen instead of a field of stretched stars is a rather less exciting big white blur — as seen in the composite above.  ""They would simply see a central disc of bright light as Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation is shifted into the visible spectrum,"" the University's press release announced Monday. ""There would be no sign of stars because of the Doppler effect."" SEE ALSO: Obama's Death Star Response is Best Star Wars Tribute in History The team of M.Phil candidates used Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity to calculate the effects of light-speed travel. And the news for Han and Chewie gets worse.  Not only is their view far more boring, but their ship is going to be under some serious pressure from cosmic X-rays. About as much pressure as you'd find at the bottom of the Pacific, the team calculated. (Talk about the dark side of the force.) ""Perhaps Disney should take the physical implications of such high speed travel into account in their forthcoming films,"" offered Leicester student Katie Dexter. Then again, if Lucas was at all concerned with scientific accuracy, he wouldn't have added awesome sound effects to all those space battles — and the movies would be poorer for it.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/straight-talk-iphone-5-data-plan/,Straight Talk iPhone 5 Data Plan Is Not Unlimited,"Walmart last week announced the availability of iPhone 5 on a Straight Talk no-contract plan with unlimited voice, text and data, but like most so-called unlimited plans, this one too has a limit. For $45 a month, you can use up to 2GB of data, which these days isn't a whole lot. Stream a movie on your shiny new iPhone? Not likely. However, Walmart has made it easier to buy an iPhone 5 off-contract by offering $25-a-month financing on the purchase of a phone as long as you use a Walmart credit card. Only a few prepaid providers offer the newest iPhone (Cricket ; C Spire, a regional provider in the South), and you'll pay $649 up front for the phone. At Walmart, you have the option to buy the phone outright or put it on your card with no interest fee. It's no secret that carriers use the term ""unlimited"" to describe plans that indeed include what the industry calls a soft data cap. That means when you use your data allotment, the service slows data speeds to a crawl. Technically, data is unlimited, but it's so slow that it's unusable. For the majority of smartphone users, 2GB of data is often enough as long as a reliable Wi-Fi connection is available. Streaming video can quickly eat up data, but if you watch a movie over Wi-Fi, it won't count against your data allotment.  SEE ALSO: Why You Probably Don't Need an Unlimited Data Plan But choosing a prepaid plan instead of a two-year contract for your smartphone saves consumers around $1,000 or more over a 24-month period. For instance, an AT&T customer will pay $70 for voice, $20 for messaging and $30 for 3GB of data a month — that's $120 a month compared with $45 via Walmart's Straight Talk. The iPhone 5 16GB in black and white is available at most Walmart locations. For an additional $15 a month, Straight Talk subscribers can add international calling to Mexico, Canada and India.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/surface-sales-estimate/,Another Sign Microsoft Surface Is Struggling,"The Surface was supposed to be Microsoft's real answer to the iPad — a Windows-based tablet that would satisfy both casual users and digital workers. Now it looks like it's appealing to neither. UBS analyst Brent Thill estimates Microsoft has sold only 1 million Surface RT tablets, reported by Business Insider. He had previously estimated 2 million. To put those figures in perspective, Apple is estimated to sell in the neighborhood of 20 million iPads for the same period. This is far from the first sign that the Surface isn't doing very well. A month ago, brokerage firm Detwiler Fenton said Microsoft wouldn't even break a million units, estimating sales for the quarter at 600,000 units maximum. However, that was before Microsoft expanded retail distribution of the Surface early, which likely led to better numbers.  In addition, last week Samsung said it was pulling back plans to release its own tablet based on Windows RT — the same operating system running on the Surface — citing customer ignorance about the pared-down version of Windows made to run on ARM-based devices. Cost was also a factor. ""We didn't necessarily attain the price point that we hoped to attain,"" Samsung senior vice president Mike Abary told CNET. Looking at web usage, a study conducted by Chikita Insights just before the holidays found the Microsoft Surface accounted for just 0.22 ad impressions for every 100 impressions from an iPad. Finally, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said in an interview last November that sales were ""modest"" (although Microsoft later said Ballmer was talking about supply and distribution of the Surface, not sales). If the Surface RT is doing poorly, Microsoft's hopes in the tablet space could be resurrected by the Surface Pro, a slightly larger version of the device that runs Windows 8 Pro. Microsoft has previously said the Pro version would launch three months after the Surface RT, or about the end of January. Why do you think the Surface is struggling, and do you think the Surface Pro will turn things around? Let us know in the comments. Photo courtesy of Microsoft This is the Surface tablet with Touch Cover in place. Microsoft's boxing is as clean and well-designed as anything from Apple. Details about Surface can be found on the back. Notice that our unit is the 64 GB model. This is all there is inside the Surface box: A Tablet and AC power adapter.  Underneath the Surface is this tiny instruction booklet. It has just enough instruction to get you started. A closer look at the instruction booklet. Removing the Surface for the first time. The metal kick stand flips open with a flick of the finger. This USB 2.0 slot works with most of your Windows peripherals. Here, I stuck in a Bluetooth connector for my Microsoft Arc Mouse. The magnetic power jack is convenient, but the magnetic plug doesn't always click in that smoothly. Also, is this really the best spot for a micro-SD slot? This tablet is built with a keyboard in mind. Both the Touch Cover and Touch Keyboard snap into this channel with a resounding ""click!"" Front and back cameras shoot 720P video and just above 1 MP stills. The volume rocker has an interesting trick: Press up or down volume twice and the volume will zoom all the way up or down on its own. We got the $699 64 GB Surface and Touch Cover bundle. This is what the Touch Cover looks like in the box. The Touch Cover, which is the same width as the Surface tablet, easily accommodates my two largish hands. This is the welcome screen. A swipe up or tap on the space bar brings up the log-in. Just like traditional Windows, Windows RT supports multiple user profiles. You can alter Windows RT just as much as you can Windows 8 and its predecessor, Windows 7. While I had some trouble finding a decent drawing app in the Windows app store, Fresh Paint is a powerful, virtual media app. Yes, you can draw on this tablet with your finger, but it did not work particularly well with a stylus. This racing game's start screen was far more impressive than the actual game. IE 10 in Windows RT is, like IE in Windows 8, a full-scale, touch-friendly redesign. Amazon has built a native app for Windows RT. Of course, if you build an app for Windows 8, it should work for everything from Windows Phone to Windows 8 to Windows RT. Windows RT Start Screen looks and works exactly like Windows 8 If you want to share in Windows RT, you have to dig under People to find Twitter and Facebook. I love how easy it is to connect to a Homegroup printer and print right from within Windows RT. Search is ubiquitous and contextual. So are settings. RT has a file system that's quite easy to navigate. Searchable across files is easy, too. Underneath RT is a very familiar Windows Desktop and Explorer like file manager. A swipe down at the top of the screen reveals all your open browser windows (in thumbnail form). A swipe up from the bottom opens a contextual control bar, in this case for email. You have your photos on the device and those you're sharing with the Skydrive cloud, The Task Manager is simplified, but still there in Windows RT (so is the Registry). Got too many tiles? Pinch and Zoom to get 30,000 ft view. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/tebow-brother-tweet/,Tim Tebow's Brother Is a Trolling Superstar,"Maybe you only kind of followed the NFL playoffs this weekend. Maybe you know the scores and major stars, but missed the little things that make the games truly entertaining for sports fans of a certain sophistication. We're talking, of course, about plays like this one — and about the hidden trolling talents possessed by one Peter Tebow.  Peter is brother to Tim Tebow, the Internet demigod and fringe NFL quarterback. Tim, as most of us by now know, surged to prominence last season with an improbable string of success quarterbacking the Denver Broncos to eight regular season wins and an upset playoff victory. Then the Broncos unceremoniously shipped Tim off to the New York Jets, where he languished on the bench for a crappy team this season.  When the Broncos lost on Saturday to end their Super Bowl hopes this season with new quarterback Peyton Manning, brother Peter — who works in the Denver area as a youth pastor — couldn't resist a parting shot: Am I the only one in Denver who's happy right now? — Peter Tebow (@petertebow) January 13, 2013 Sports fans seemed to enjoy Peter's trolling schadenfreude, retweeting the post more than 2,100 times.  There seems to be a nice digital good/evil dynamic at play now between the brothers Tebow.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/tina-fey-amy-poehler-jokes/,Watch Tina Fey and Amy Poehler's Funniest Golden Globes Moments," Ah the Golden Globes, the one night of the year where, according to Amy Poehler, the ""beautiful people of film rub shoulders with the rat-faced people of television.""  It's what makes it such a special occassion. Well, that and the unlimited champagne. But we say last night's 70th annual show was memorable mostly because of the hosts, BFFs and comedy powerhouses, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. They outshone past hosts like Ricky Gervais — which they'll tell you themselves — and added an SNL flair to their comedy bits, complete with costumes and an attempt to take home awards for their made up film, Dog President.  SEE ALSO: And the Golden Globe Goes to ... GIFs!
 Even their response to seeing a former president on stage was right on beat.  ""That was Hillary Clinton's husband,"" Poehler quipped after Bill Clinton surprised the crowd to introduce Lincoln. We're not sure if it was the excessive amounts of free booze but the audience seemed to love it, and so did we. We just pray that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association hires these two indefinitely to keep all future awards shows equally torture-less.  What was your favorite joke or moment of the night?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/tinto-river-martian-life/,Life Surviving in This Spanish River Mimics Martians,"The Tinto River in Spain provides little comfort for most life. The river is naturally similar to the toxic water leaking from old mines, known as acid mine drainage. However, within that harsh river, biologists identified pockets of salt that created an oasis for bacteria. Similar salt deposits on Mars could also provide refuge for life. “The reason is that conditions in this environment [salt deposits] remain less adverse than those of their surroundings given that they provide protection from radiation, for example,” said Felipe Gómez of Spain’s Centro de Astrobiología in a press release, “and they keep moisture levels higher than outside.” Five different varieties of microorganisms were found in the salt deposits. The microbes were types of algae from the genera Dunaliella and Cyanidium. SEE ALSO: Photos: Evolution Before Your Eyes
 The Tinto River contains salt formations mixed with sulfur and iron, known as jarosite. Similar mineral deposits were identified on Mars by the Opportunity rover in 2004. Other surface salt formations were observed by the Mars Global Surveyor. These Martian deposits could host life or at least preserve its remains, according to the Centro de Astrobiología paper published in Planetary and Space Science. “From the astrological point of view, salt deposits are of great importance and should be considered when searching for life on space exploration missions, like the current Curiosity rover mission on Mars,” said Gómez.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/top-comments-jan13/,Top Comments: Readers Debate 'Booth Babes' and Zuckerberg's Message Fee,"A photo taken by Mashable reporter  Emily Price  exposed several scantily clad and colorfully painted ""Booth Babes"" at this year's International CES. Our readers weighed in on whether this is a clever marketing ploy, or an act of misogyny.   Lorin Steel  suggested that Mashable was equally at fault for posting the shocking image. While our intention was to discourage similar displays at future tech shows, her criticism does not go unacknowledged.  Reader Rosa Sow bypassed the sexism debate entirely, and instead argued that the biggest failing of the painted Booth Babes was its lazy reliance on the tired ""sex sells"" idea.  In response to Amazon's recent  announcement ,  Mashable  reporter  Todd Wasserman  asked our readers if and why they still buy CDs.  Reader  Manju Reijmer  weighed in, explaining that CDs are a thing of the past Reader Scott Lawson argued that CDs are prime for music's classical genre, especially in the case of continuous symphony tracks. Reader  Smoe S  went into further detail, explaining that a higher quality product makes the sense of ownership more enjoyable. The most discussed story this week was written by   Chris Taylor  about the $100 fee Facebook is currently charging some users to directly message its CEO.  Although some commenters expressed annoyance or disbelief, reader  Kate Hiscox  argued that this paywall was very similar to LinkedIn's.  Reader  Chris Gingrich's  comment made us laugh. Yeah, Zuckerberg, how about some reciprocity?  Reporter  Christina Warren  re-addressed the issue of Google making its maps app unavailable to Windows mobile users.  Reader  Gilad Koriski  argued that Nokia's own maps app made the lack of google maps unimportant.  Semi-naked CES ""Booth Babes,"" the status of CDs in today’s digital world, a hefty fee to message Mark Zuckerberg, and Google's decision to make the Google Maps app unavailable to Windows users were all hotly contested topics. We've pulled together our favorite comments of the week to show off the best conversations and the biggest debates. A California-based hard drive company chose to include colorfully painted, topless women in its  2013 CES presentation, incurring tons of responses via social media. Some commenters voiced support and others were vehemently against the display. Our readers hotly debated the ethics of ""booth babes"" at trade shows and in advertising in general.

 With Amazon's recent  announcement  that it will be granting CD buyers MP3 copies of songs, we asked our readers:  Why Are People Still Buying CDs? Some commenters argued that CDs have higher sound quality than songs stored in the cloud, while other readers admitted that they no longer buy physical discs.  Significant change to  Facebook is always a topic of much debate among our readers, so this week's  post about the $100 fee to message Mark Zuckerberg via his social network garnered a lot of attention. And finally, Google's decision to make its maps app unavailable for Windows mobile users  confused many, and then upset some.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/twitter-mexico-violence/,Twitter: The Safest Place for Citizen Journalists in Mexico,"A cohort of Twitter users with fake names and profile pictures have become a trusted source of information regarding drug cartel violence in Mexico.  These citizen journalists choose to remain anonymous to avoid violent backlash from gang members, but their reports have become increasingly influential. On Jan. 8, a team from Microsoft Research published a paper called ""The New War Correspondents: The Rise of Civic Media Curation in Urban Warfare,"" which details a social media study conducted over the past two years. Their main finding was that as Mexicans increasingly turn to Twitter for reports of violence, a core of mostly anonymous yet trusted curators have led the dissemination of public safety information. ""You find this small cluster of people, whom we call curators, who tend to be really well-regarded in their cities,"" Andrés Monroy-Hernández, one of the paper's five co-authors, tells Mashable. ""These particular curators are those that have a lot of followers, which means that they're somewhat trusted by the community.""  In the paper, the authors discuss how difficult it was to contact and interview the curators, who feel the work puts their lives in danger.  Those who did reply said that there was a feeling that Mexicans had been ""abandoned by their government and the media."" Mexico continues to show up on the Committee to Protect Journalists' list of most dangerous countries in the world for members of the media. ""Although traditional journalists regularly serve as curators, both on Twitter and in the more mainstream media outlets, the rise of citizen curators suggests that existing outlets are not meeting public need,"" the paper reads. In fact, during the time of his research, Monroy-Hernández says he noticed the mainstream media even began to quote social media as a source in its own reporting: ""Social media has become a source of information for mainstream media, as well as a way for mainstream media to protect itself from retaliation from drug cartels."" Though these anonymous Twitter curators don't get paid for their work, it doesn't mean they are not dedicated. One told the researchers that spending up to 15 hours a day on Twitter is common. According to Monroy-Hernández, his general sense is that these people provide this service for altruistic reasons. Twitter user @BalaceraMTY has been reporting on violence in Monterrey for two years and has amassed more than 60,000 followers. In an email reply to Mashable, the owner of the account said the following: ""It all started on Twitter while I was looking for information on how to protect my relatives and myself, considering how violent the region had gotten at that point. It was vital to be properly informed of such dangerous circumstances. At the same time, I started commenting on the information I was gathering. I never thought my number of followers would grow the way it did. What do I get in return? Nothing economically, it’s not about that. It’s really just the satisfaction of being able to help, the idea of doing something so things can eventually get better."" The anonymous curator says they have been through extremely ""hard times"" in Monterrey over the past few years, but his or her belief is that things are getting better: ""While there is need to manage information, such as my time and health permits, I will continue trying to do my part."" Monroy-Hernández says this phenomenon is not specific to Mexico, and that Twitter has emerged as a trusted source of information in other places where violence occurs, particularly relating to organized crime.  For social media outlets to accomodate these reporters, the authors of the paper suggest that ""there is a significant need for developing technical strategies to assess trust without revealing identity information."" The authors will formally present their findings at the Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW 2013) conference in late February. Mashable composite, images via Wikimedia Commons and Twitter "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/twitter-pentagon-future/,Can Twitter Predict the Future? Pentagon Says Maybe,"The Defense Department wants new computer tools to analyze mounds of unstructured text, blogs and tweets as part of a coordinated push to help military analysts predict the future and make decisions faster. The search is part of the Office of Naval Research's ""Data to Decisions"" program, a series of three-to-10-year initiatives that will address the volume of information that threatens to overwhelm planners in the digital age, contract databases indicate. The goal is to build an open source system that can unite various tools that collect, manage and draw relationships between data sets. In a program announcement, ONR is calling for computer algorithms to predict events, fuse different forms of information and offer context on unfolding events. The office expects to spend $500,000 each year in funding. “The Department of Defense recognizes the potential for text analytics to play a vital role in future capabilities that inform timely and accurate situational awareness in time-constrained, uncertain, and complex environments,” the tender reads. Defense is seeking ways to predict the future by monitoring Twitter, blogs and news, and determining the ""frequency of contacts between nodes or clusters."" As networks grow larger and more complex, researchers have found it harder to monitor group behavior. ONR also wants researchers to discover networks that could be hidden within networks, and how information and money flows through a community. Officials also want tools that fuse and assimilate multiple, incomplete data sets on agriculture, weather, terrain, demographics and economic indicators to find patterns. ONR is especially interested in ways to comb text-based information to provide more nuanced views of how groups, such as terrorists, operate by extrapolating the ""stated values and beliefs that motivated behaviors of interest,"" ""community structure and clusters of social networks"" and the level of ""emotional support expressed towards topics or persons."" The office also seeks better technologies for machine translation and processing — translating physical characters or sounds — into one machine-readable language. Proposals are due Jan. 15 and funding decisions will be made by Feb. 15, contract documents indicate. Carey Schwartz, an ONR program officer and researcher affiliated with the Applied Research Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University, spearheads the program. So far, Clifton Park, N.Y.-based Kitware, which develops algorithms to analyze battlefield imagery, has been slated for funding, in partnership with software developer SOARTech, data-focused firm Signal Innovations Group, sensor processing company Systems Technology Research, defense giant Lockheed Martin Corps. and University of Southern California.  Government agencies have been pushing technologists to refine techniques to sift through open source intelligence or publicly available data sets. The CIA, responding to mounting calls that such information needed to be systematically collected and better analyzed, created the National Open Source Center in suburban Northern Virginia around 2005 to acquire and analyze the information to support intelligence agencies.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Pentagon's research arm, in 2012 sought out research ideas on computer programs that predict ""cyber terrorism events"" by detecting how criminal groups and hackers interact on the Internet.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/twitter-tv-mystery-hawaii-5-0/,"Hey Twitter, Time to Solve Your First Ever TV Murder","Call it ""Tweet Your Own Adventure."" The CBS procedural Hawaii 5-0 is set to make history Monday night — becoming the first TV show to have its ending determined by Twitter. In fact, it will be both the first and second show to try this trick.  The plot revolves around the murder of a teacher at O'ahu State University, for which there are three suspects — his boss, his assistant and a disgruntled student. Unlike with every other cop show in the history of television, the producers have laid out and filmed three possible endings.  The ending shown will be determined entirely by how many votes are received on Twitter for each character. And because the show is on twice — once at 10 p.m. on the East Coast, once at 10 p.m. on the West Coast — the outcomes could well be entirely different.  SEE ALSO: Dunder Mifflin Crowdsources Super Bowl Ad
 ""I love that our dedicated and attentive fans will actually play a part in resolving our story,"" says Executive Producer Peter Lenkov. ""I've always felt the most fun aspect of watching a mystery is trying to figure out whodunit."" That isn't exactly what fans will be doing, however. The satisfaction of a good murder mystery is solving a puzzle using the clues the writer has carefully laid out for you. By necessity, this show will have to lay clues to all three suspects.  There's no inevitability about the outcome — it's like a crossword where the answers adapt to what you want them to be.  Twitter users will then be able to play God, rather than Sherlock Holmes, deciding which of three possible realities will come to pass. Justice, in this case, is altered retroactively.  No matter which choice the audience makes en masse, it gets to be right. Whomever is least likable gets the chop. You might call it a TV lynching.  Still, it will be interesting to see if the East Coast and West Coast opt for different murderers. (Somehow, we doubt it'll be the student.) All three endings will be available online after the show.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/14/twitter-weight-study/,Study Says Twitter Can Help You Lose Weight,"If trimming a few pounds is on your New Year's resolution list, a new study suggests you should turn to Twitter. Researchers at the University of South Carolina's Arnold School of Public Health revealed in a report that popular social-networking site Twitter can serve as a support system for those trying to lose weight.  In fact, those who participated in a weight loss program had more overall success when they used the site to receive and share information. Not to mention every 10 posts to Twitter by the test group corresponded with about 0.5% weight loss, the study said. SEE ALSO: How Everyday Tools Can Help You Lose Weight
 ""We wanted to find a way to provide the group support we normally deliver during a face-to-face weight loss intervention to the online community,"" Gabrielle Turner-McGrievy, lead author of the study, told Mashable. ""In typical face-to-face delivery methods, there is no way for someone to ask for what to order at a restaurant as they’re sitting and looking at the menu. With Twitter, we were able to do that."" Although traditional behavioral weight loss interventions provide social support weekly, it can also be costly and time consuming. The study — which was conducted among 96 overweight and obese men living in a metropolitan area during a six-month period — assigned participants to two groups: One that listened to only podcasts to help with weight loss and another that coupled podcasts with mobile phone use. The latter group followed each other on Twitter, providing social support to one another via status updates such as ""I went to the gym today. Felt great!"" Users in the mobile group logged on to Twitter daily to read and post messages. Weight loss counselors also tweeted participants twice a day with information and words of encouragement. Overall, those who actively engaged with Twitter during the study lost more weight.
 
""But Twitter didn't work for everyone in the study — some people were not engaged or posted only a few times,"" Turner-McGrievy said. ""When we looked at what predicted Twitter use in the study, it didn’t matter if you were a Twitter user prior to enrollment. What did matter was initial weight loss."" Although she said the researchers aren't sure if being initially successful led participants to post more to Twitter or if posting to Twitter led to initial weight loss. The team is also looking at Facebook to see if it provides the same support to those looking to lose weight. ""We hope to explore more in future studies about how to predict who will engage in a social network,"" she said. Image via iStockphoto, KLH39 "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/aaron-swartz-petition/,"25,000 People Sign Petition to Remove Aaron Swartz's Prosecutors","An online petition that asks the White House to remove the U.S. attorney in charge of the prosecution of Internet activist and hacker Aaron Swartz passed the 25,000 signature threshold Tuesday that should prompt an official response. Swartz committed suicide in New York City on Friday. At the time of his death, Swartz was accused of computer fraud and awaiting a trial expected to begin in the spring. He faced a maximum of 35 years of prison and up to $1 million in fines.  The petition has now passed 25,000 signatures, which means the White House is supposed to answer it — although it's not legally bound to do so. A recent petition to build a Death Star was addressed, although others take more time and some go unanswered.  Parker Higgins, an activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights advocacy group, lamented Monday that a petition to grant open access to scholarly articles has been unanswered for more than seven months.  ""White House makes jokes about their beer recipe and building a death star, but they don't answer a real petition on open access,"" Higgins tweeted. Swartz was accused of sneaking into the Massachussets Institute of Technology's library, plugging his laptop into a network closet and illegally downloading millions of scholarly articles from the online publisher JSTOR.  Swartz was reportedly depressed, but his family, supporters and legal experts such as Lawrence Lessig, have accused the prosecution led by assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Heymann, working under Ortiz, of overreach that may have played a role in his suicide. Swartz's lawyer had seen his plea agreement rejected as recently as last Wednesday.  According to Swartz's latest lawyer, Marty Weinberg, his last plea deal was accepted by JSTOR, but the deal fell through when the MIT refused to sign the deal. MIT's president already announced that the famed school will conduct an investigation to assess its eventual role in Swartz's death. SEE ALSO: Technology's Greatest Minds Say Goodbye to Aaron Swartz
 The success of the petition will certainly keep stirring the controversy surrounding his death. Andrew Good, Swartz's former lawyer, told the San Francisco Gate Monday that last year he told federal prosecutors that his client was a suicide risk.  ""Put him in jail, he'll be safe there,"" they responded, according to Good.  Photo courtesy of Flickr, ragesoss "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/aaron-swartz-tech-world-depression/,After Aaron Swartz: The Tech World Must Talk About Depression,"As with so many others, Aaron Swartz had an indelible impact on my life. I didn't know Aaron well; we exchanged a dozen emails in early 2008. Still, if you followed the geekier aspects of Mac and web standards culture in the early 2000s, it was hard not to run across Aaron's work. You probably know the basic outline by now. He co-wrote the spec for RSS at 14. He was part of Creative Commons at the very beginning. He beta-tested Markdown for John Gruber. Oh, and he co-founded Reddit (whether acknowledged or not) and sold it to Condé Nast. The guy was a genius, in the purest sense of the word. When I first emailed Aaron, we were at different phases in our life. At 25, I was just starting my career as a tech reporter. I was green and unsure of exactly what it was I wanted to achieve. Though younger than me, Aaron was far more accomplished. He was 21 and had sold his first startup, left the company that acquired it, and was busy immersing himself in a wide array of policy projects. I first emailed Aaron about Jottit, one of those post-Reddit side projects. I was familiar with his work and was a longtime reader of his blog, so I made sure to mention some of our shared passions for books, film and the radio show This American Life. We were also both depressed. Depression came up in our second email exchange. We had both written online about our respective struggles with it. I was just coming out of a major bout that had lasted months. I described it as ""coming above ground into the light after months in darkness."" Aaron too seemed to be coming out of his depression. He was frustrated that it wasn't something he could control. There's an odd paradox with depression and all mental illnesses: It's one of the few diseases where the patient blames herself and feels like a failure for having to accept help or take medication. This is especially difficult if you're highly intelligent and usually able to solve problems and answer questions — as many in the tech community are. At 25, I'd already suffered through four major depressions since the age of 14. I had battled through phases of wanting to believe I could conquer my illness without the need of medication. But by the age of 18, I had come to the conclusion that it was necessary. I had stopped feeling like this made me weak or less capable. It was never said explicitly, but I got the sense that Aaron didn't feel that way. It's difficult for anyone to come to terms with the idea that you can't have complete control over your mind, let alone someone of Aaron's intellect. We stopped emailing each other after a few weeks. My life got busier. My career started to take off. Aaron became increasingly focused on public policy and advocacy for worthy causes. In July 2011, Aaron was charged with hacking into the journal archive JSTOR. I e-mailed him to see if he could give an official comment. I also let him know that he had my support and if there was ever anything I could do, to let me know. He politely declined to comment and thanked me for my offer. It was to be our last email exchange. SEE ALSO: 25,000 Sign Petition to Remove Aaron Swartz' Prosecutors I won't pretend to know exactly what Aaron was going through, or why he made the decision to take his life. I can only speculate that the impending legal case against him — a trial that seems unfair and so very trivial in the wake of all of this — was taking a heavy toll. But while I can't speak for his situation, I am an expert on major depression. I diagnosed myself at the age of 9, on the basis of a mental health TV commercial. At 14, I was officially diagnosed with major depression and anxiety disorder. So began a 30-month process of trying to find the right combination of medicines that would properly align my biochemistry. At 16, I missed the second semester of my sophomore year of high school because I literally couldn't get out of bed. I just wanted to die. I prayed for death. After a few good years and a good start in college, depression reared its ugly head again at the age of 20. A few years later, my psychiatrist told me I would probably never be able to come off my anti-depressants. While I haven't had a period of depression in more than five years since then, I still feel the occasional twinge of it. This is not a disease that can be cured. It's chronic, and it's for life. Depression is an illnesses largely hidden from society. By the time the illness is visible — when a person can't get out of bed, when they stop caring for themselves or their job — they've already been suffering for a long, long time. Most depressed people work with every fiber of their being to hide the horrible fact of it. To be depressed is to be a very good actor. Fake it long enough, you think, and maybe it'll become reality. That might work with other aspects of life, but it doesn't work with depression. At some point, holding back the feelings of pain and despair becomes too much. It finds a way to spill out. It's messy. I've often described depression as a vacuum or a vortex. When you're in it, you can't remember life on the outside. Everything is sadness. Everything is bleak. Nothing seems to have purpose. Tiny flickers of light, moments of reprieve, often just make you feel even worse. It aches powerfully, like the loss of your first love. It hurts like the scorn of high school bullies. And it sucks everything you have into its black hole of destruction. What's worse is that when you come out of it, it can be difficult to remember what depression is like. It is only through periods of genuine sadness — like the loss of someone as young and talented as Aaron — that I connect with that part of my brain and remember those feelings. I bring up my personal history because there are many in the tech community who have experienced something like it. I can't say we (tech journalists and the techies we cover) are more prone to depression; I can say we're iconoclastic enough to talk openly about it. Ben Huh, Cheezburger maker extraordinaire, has been a leading light in this regard. Huh told Mashable the story of what saved his life here.  Mental illness has become one of the last social taboos in Western society (it's far, far worse in other parts of the world). There is a profound and subtle stigma associated with depression, anxiety, bi-polar, OCD, ADHD and any other in the myriad of treatable, functional illnesses. Bias against depression is systemic. Until Obamacare, having a diagnosis of major depression or an anxiety disorder would prevent a person from getting full-coverage health insurance as an individual. It's a pre-existing condition. Most insurance companies won't take you, no matter how much you're willing to pay. At 27, I was young, a non-smoker, a casual drinker, with perfect blood work, low cholesterol and well below the average weight for my height. Yet I couldn't get any insurance company to accept me on a PPO plan. It wasn't until my company had enough employees to get good health insurance that I was able to stop paying more than $800 a month for medication. I wasn't alone. A number of my friends could not get insured after college. They could not afford their antidepressants or anxiety medication or ADHD drugs. The stigma breeds fear. Fear keeps those suffering quiet. But in the tech world, we're all about finding new solutions — the way Aaron did. So for Aaron's sake, it's time to stop being quiet. It's time to stop hovering in the darkness. It's time to come out of the closet, to speak frequently and at length about depression. Stigma doesn't go away until the population hears personal stories from the afflicted. History bears this out, time after time, with each stigmatized group. More stories means creating a culture where future Aarons know they can speak out about their suffering.  Fellow techies, let's tell our stories. I for one am tired of staying silent. Image courtesy of Jacob Applebaum "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/adam-carolla-launches-video-podcast-network-on-youtube/,Adam Carolla Launches 'Video Podcast Network' on YouTube,"Just hours before the debut of the Video Podcast Network on YouTube, podcasting stalwart Adam Carolla has pies and sweaters for dogs on his mind. They help tell a story about survival.  The network spawns from the success of The Adam Carolla Show, a nearly 4-year-old daily comedy podcast that eventually secured the Guinness World Record for most-downloaded podcast ever in 2011. During the podcast's early years, he asked himself a humble question. ""My first goal was just survival; can we make a business out of this?"" he tells Mashable, saying it's a question many people have whether it's making sweaters for dogs, baking pies or making podcasts. ""That's nine-tenths of the battle."" ""Then comes the icing on the cake — or in this case, the à la mode on the pie — because that survival question has been answered,"" he adds. The à la mode for Carolla appears to be the Video Podcast Network, which starting Tuesday night will serve as a hub for several comedy podcasts with a visual spin.  VPN's first podcast will feature Harley Morenstein, host of popular YouTube cooking show Epic Meal Time, and will air live on YouTube at 7 p.m. PST. You can watch it right here:   Video Podcast Network will post a podcast every Tuesday from Carolla.  ""I'm not scared of doing it live. I like to wing it. Rehearsed or scripted sounds scary."" This week, however, VPN will deliver a comedic blitz. During the Sundance Film Festival in Utah on Friday and Saturday, VPN will live stream five video podcasts from comedians Tom Lennon and Paul Scheer as well as Comedy Bang Bang with Scott Aukerman, You Made This Weird with Pete Holmes, Who Charted? with Howard Kremer and Kulap Vilaysack, Call Chelsea with Chelsea Peretti, and Windy City Heat. After Sundance, VPN will regularly feature podcasts from The Big 3 and Earwolf with producer Daniel Kellison at the helm of the network. VPN will fall under the Adam Carolla Entertainment Broadcasting Network umbrella, which also manages the For Crying Out Loud podcast from Carolla's wife, Lynette. ""If you're baking the pie, your wife is going to come into the kitchen"" and create ""her own cookies,"" he says. The Adam Carolla Show also occasionally features their 6-year-old twins, Natalia and Santino, who sometimes jump into their dad's studio and grab the mic.  Carolla can only wonder what it will be like when his kids grow up and want to listen to his old podcasts — his self-described ""audio diaries."" Imagine going back to 1993 and hearing your parents talk about how someone ""invented a telephone with no cord,"" he says. ""It's weird."" Photo via Kevin Winter/Getty Images "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/app-game-kids-healthy-eating/,App Game for Kids Encourages Healthy Eating,"Similar to how parents hide vegetables in grilled cheese sandwiches and pasta to get their kids to eat greens, finding a way to teach your kids to make healthy choices might take some creativity.  Dennis Ai, who developed a smartphone game for kids called JiveHealth, is one of 10 semifinalists in the End Childhood Obesity Innovation Challenge. In the game, players have to search for healthy foods in order to take their characters to the next level. So kids will learn about making smart food choices while immersed in a game.  The in-app game is the only tech-related semifinalist in the competition. The top three finalists will present their ideas at the Building a Healthier Future Summit in Washington, D.C., from March 6 to 8, 2013. First Lady Michelle Obama is likely to attend, along with more than 1,000 business, policy and health leaders, writes the blog BuiltInChicago.  SEE ALSO: Kids & Technology: The Developmental Health Debate  More than one third of children and adolescents in 2008 were considered overweight or obese, according to the CDC. Overweight or obese children are likely to grow up to be overweight and obese adults, making them susceptible to a slew of chronic conditions and ailments over their lifetime.  This isn't the first time a company has tried to get kids practicing healthy habits through games. DanceDance Revolution recently announced it would bring a version of its game to schools so an entire class could play. And at this year's CES we discovered a health monitor for kids — the Ibitz lets kids earn rewards for their activity.  Do your kids play any games that teach them about health or get them moving?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/bad-lip-reading-nfl/,Bad Lip Readings Give NFL Games a Hilarious New Soundtrack," New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady struts off the field and removes his helmet.  ""Whoo! I'm white!"" he yells, before high-fiving a teammate on the sideline.  No, that's not undercover audio from some hidden NFL Films clip. It's America's Game getting the Bad Lip Reading treatment — to hilarious effect.  For the uninitiated, BLR is a YouTube series that slaps comedic — yet visually believable — overdubs on famous people. They've already stuffed wacky words in the mouths of Paul Ryan, Katniss Everdeen and Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.  The video above shows your favorite coaches and players as you've never seen — er, heard — them before.  BONUS: 25 of YouTube's Funniest Sports Fails  This runaway vehicle wreaked minor on-field havoc following a high school football championship in Texas last December. But a heroic bystander hopped aboard and put on the brakes. No casualties occurred, and the clip immediately became Internet legend. Watch out for the ricochet, goalie! This kid gets it in the right in the chops. What happens when you put an inflatable dinosaur on rollerblades and ask it to skate down a flight of stairs? Amazingness, that's what. In sports, to ""flop"" is to exaggerate the force of contact in hopes of drawing a favorable call from officials. But you've got to time it much, much better than this guy does. Apparently, if you hug a member of the opposite team after scoring a goal in hockey, you will get punched in the face. This kid is just in the wrong place at the wrong time...to the benefit of the rest of us. College football mascots are supposed to represent their schools in a fun, positive light — which doesn't typically include picking fights. Here, the University of Oregon's duck slams the University of Houston's cougar. Bonus points for the sick elbow drop, though. Not saying we could successfully lift 432 pounds above our heads, but dang, that looks painful. German weightlifter Matthias Steiner dropped this massive barbell on his neck during the London Olympics this summer, but escaped serious injury. Sometimes, when you fail, you actually win. Why jump over hurdles when you could just RUN STRAIGHT THROUGH THEM? File under: Never, Ever Gets Old. After what could best be described as an ""optimistic"" shot attempt in a game last season, NBA center JaVale McGee showed some nice hustle getting back on defense. Only problem? His team still had the ball. But that wasn't McGee's only legendary moment. Here, he shows why it's not a good idea to try dunking from the free throw line mid-game. For some reason, London's Olympic promotions this summer involved hanging Mayor Boris Johnson on a zipline while waving a pair of tiny flags. Then he got stuck halfway through and it was pretty much the best, funniest, awkwardest thing that could have happened. Major Leaguer Kendry Morales broke his lower left leg while celebrating a game-winning grand slam in 2010. This edited video provides the before, during and after rundown. See? White guys can jump? It's just the landing that's the hard part. The announcer here sums it up perfectly. She calls this attempt from the 1992 Olympics ""an absolute failed dive."" What begins as an innocent enough piggyback ride atop a fuzzy mascot turns into a pretty epic collision — and YouTube gold. Dude! If you're gonna pump up the crowd like that, you can't just faceplant into the sand. When you think about it, is there any better way to celebrate a touchdown than by pegging an unsuspecting spectator in the face? Bonus points for originality, at least. You'd think a professional golfer could put the ball in the hole with less than 16 strokes. Kevin Na — and the rest of the world — found out otherwise on this par-four hole at the 2011 Valero Texas Open. Well, that's one way of doing it...right? Tie game, clock winding down — it's always better to get one last attempt up than just let the game go into overtime. A full court desperation heave with a 11 seconds to go is never the way to do it, however. This classic gaffe by the University of Connecticut's Roscoe Smith came during a matchup of top teams in 2011. Its veracity may be suspect, but this 2008 YouTube classic has more than 12.7 million views, despite a mind-numbing soundtrack. The summer of 2011 was a tough time for NBA star LeBron James. It was full of lingering ill-will for his decision to the leave the Cleveland Cavaliers and snarky schadenfreude over his initial failure to win a championship with the Miami Heat. So it makes perfect sense that he'd let off some steam by viciously dunking on a tiny kid at summer camp, right? That's what happens at the 0:43 mark of this video. We're not quite sure why this mascot thought standing on top of a basketball rim was a good idea. Thumbnail image credit Getty Images/Getty Images Sport/Harry How "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/boil-the-frog/,From Miley Cyrus to Miles Davis in 18 Songs,"Drop a frog in hot water and he jumps out instantly. But submerge the little guy in cold H2O and heat the pot gradually, and you can cook him alive before he notices.  This morbid myth usually functions as a metaphor about social change, but it was also the inspiration behind the aptly titled music app Boil the Frog. And you play the part of the frog in this particular scenario.  The app operates on a simple conceit: Choose two musicians and Boil the Frog generates a playlist that links the two musical genres. It transitions so gradually that you might not notice song-to-song stylistic changes, even if the first and last artists are drastically different. The musical environment has changed around you. You are, effectively, boiled.  ""I like the idea of this musical journey,"" says Paul Lamere, the app's developer. ""Instead of just creating a static playlist of songs that all sound the same, I like the idea of being able to have a progression. I think that's how a lot of people like to listen to music, as well."" The programmer built Boil the Frog on top of two APIs: Rdio, which provides the music, and The Echo Nest, which provides ""everything else."" The music information company, where Lamere is director of developer platforms, has powered music apps for MTV and Spotify, among others.  The Echo Nest's music brain holds more than a trillion data points on 30 million songs, but Lamere decided he only needed a catalog of the 100,000 (or so) most popular musicians. An artist similarity algorithm allowed him to build a graph connecting these artists to their closest neighbors. ""The Echo Nest has a really good idea of 'If you like Weezer, we think you might be also interested in these 10 or 20 other bands that are very similar culturally and acoustically.'"" From there, he applied a short-path algorithm so users could make their way from one artist to another in a reasonable amount of time. But he wasn't done yet. Early on, Lamere found these paths could lead through pretty obscure territory. If you want a route from Jay-Z to Katy Perry, two of the biggest names in pop music, you probably don't want to stray far into the indie spectrum. So Lamere adjusted the graph. Now, popular artists more frequently lead to popular artists, and unknowns to unknowns.  He also collected a song catalog designed to lessen the shock of jumping between artists. By minimizing the energy jump from song to song, Lamere says users can avoid a head banger following a folk ballad. This ensures the ride from artist to artist is as smooth as possible. If there are bumps along the way, of course, Lamere also programmed in an easy Bypass button so you can skip songs, rerouting around any song you don't want to hear, like a GPS guiding you to your final destination.  Boil the Frog might not be the most revolutionary music app of all time, but it is fun to play with. For Lamere, it's an old concept he was finally able to hammer out over the holidays. And it cuts through the tedium of some modern music discovery: ""Some of these music sites out there give you a radio experience. There's sort of a fatigue that comes in. It's just the same thing over and over again. So this is a way to listen to something that takes you someplace new."" Say you want to prove to your reluctant Belieber bestie that System of a Down might be up his alley. You could inundate him with System until he's sick of it, or just send him a link to the Bieber/System playlist (10 songs) and let the boiling begin.   Lamere admitted this kind of guided social music discovery was also part of the inspiration behind Boil the Frog. The idea iterated under a different name, Music Makeover, when the developer was trying to guide his teenage daughter from Miley Cyrus to Miles Davis.  Lamere released the app on his music technology blog, Music Machinery, where he also debuted another fun music app, The Infinite Jukebox, in November of last year. (Pro tip: Try loading Gangnam Style into The Infinite Jukebox. If you don't have Gangnam fatigue yet, you soon will.)  In the two weeks since its release, Boil the Frog has garnered ""modest"" traffic, Lamere says, as well as a fair amount of feedback. After some initial bug fixes, most of the comments have politely critiqued his app: I don't know which I find more astounding: that the path from Karlheinz Stockhausen to Frank Sinatra is only 12 songs long, or that it goes through the soundtrack to Star Wars Episode 3: Return of the Sith. For now, Boil the Frog's Rdio infrastructure means only subscribers to the online music service will hear their playlists in full (otherwise, you'll get 30-second samples of each song). If you're having trouble deciding on a particular artist, check out Lamere's list of faves, like Mickey Mouse/deadmau5 or Elvis/Elvis. We also recommend Ben Folds/Ben Folds Five. ""I think this is where the tool really shines, is in music discovery,"" Lamere says. ""Starting off with a slow, quiet song and building gradually to a high, energetic song is really appealing to me."" Have you boiled the frog yet? How did your playlist turn out?

 Get ready to meet the Long brothers — but be sure to have some tissue handy first.  Conner is 9-years-old, and Cayden is two years younger. Cayden was born with a debilitating condition called spastic cerebral palsy, but that hasn't stopped him from competing in triathlons (with a little help from his big brother). Cayden ditches his wheelchair for a cart or stroller, and Conner runs and bikes with Cayden in tow.  SEE ALSO: How Facebook Inspired One Woman's Incredible 'Tough Mudder'

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/can-in-car-apps-ever-be-safe/,Can You Drive Safely While Using an App?," People are going to use smartphones in their cars whether we enable them or not, a GM spokesperson told Mashable at International CES 2013 when explaining the company's plans to create an in-car smartphone-syncing dashboard.  It's true that people have a hard time taking a break from their mobile device — even when they're behind the wheel. A new study from McKinsey shows that 35% of smartphone owners said they use them while driving. And those are just the ones who admitted it. Out of the 4,000 people surveyed for the report, 89% said they use their phone for calls while driving; 68% said for navigation and 39% said for SMS. The survey also shows that 55% of people ages 18 to 39 say they think in-car access to data is important. And 83% of that same group is willing to pay for in-car access.  At CES 2013, car companies like Ford and GM were eager to share their upcoming smartphone-integrated systems, plus initiatives to encourage developers to make more apps that consumers can use while in their cars.  Sound dangerous? There's definitely that potential since using your phone while driving is distracting: texting and driving makes an accident 23 times more likely; another report shows that up to 25% of all roadway accidents are gadget related. However, we have seen some apps that can be used to create safer drivers. Yet the statistics on gadget-related accidents, and what is working to prevent those accidents, are clear. Some states have passed bans on the use of mobile devices while driving:  California, for instance, saw road fatalities decline by 22% in just two years after it implemented a ban on talking or texting on a mobile phone while driving.  But maybe the car companies have a point — the consumers are going to use their devices regardless, so they might as well make them more touch-free.  Scott Fosgard, infotainment communications manager for GM, told Mashable at International CES 2013 that safety would be a top priority for any in-car app they would install.  In-car apps would work through a dashboard installed in the car, so it could possibly require less of your attention than a smartphone.  At this point, car makers are open to any new ideas from developers for in-car apps. Some have suggested navigation apps; free streaming music apps; and apps that help people find the closest gas station while monitoring how much fuel their car has in its tank.  Do you think integrated in-car apps would be distracting for drivers? Tell us in the comments.  Photo courtesy of iStockphoto, gaspr13  "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/ceos-social-networks/,Only 18% of Top CEOs Are on Social Networks,"Social networks like Facebook and Twitter may be gaining users at a quick pace, but at least one group continues to be hesitant about joining: CEOs. Only 18% of the CEOs of the world's top 50 biggest companies by revenue have one or more social networking accounts, according to a study released Tuesday by global pr firm Weber Shandwick. By comparison, the firm conducted a similar study in 2010 and found that 16% of the top CEOs had at least one social networking account, suggesting that not much has changed in the past three years. The problem, according to the firm's president of digital, Chris Perry, is that maintaining a profile can be time-consuming and the risks of doing so for CEOs may be viewed as outweighing the rewards. ""There is a risk with off-the-cuff commentary,"" Perry told Mashable. ""There are lots of examples of that hurting CEOs and the companies for being seen as undisciplined."" Indeed, the study found that one social network in particular — Twitter — has actually lost members of this elite CEO group, a fact that Perry says could be due in part to a greater perceived potential for risk there compared to LinkedIn or Facebook. Between 2010 and this year, the percentage of the top 50 CEOs on Facebook grew from 4% to 10% while the percentage on Twitter dropped from 8% to 2%.  There is at least one notable exception to this trend, however: GE's CEO Jeff Immelt joined Twitter in September and has tweeted several dozen times since.  It may be a sensible precaution for CEOs, but the downside is the company misses out on a potentially powerful way to engage with customers and get its message out there. What's more, the firm found that one-third of top CEOs had their names tied to fake social media accounts, showing the downside of not establishing a presence on these sites. Even though the vast majority of top CEOs don't have personal accounts on social networking sites, they do maintain a social presence online on behalf of the company in other ways. Weber Shandwick found that 66% of the CEOs engaged online through biographies and videos on company websites as well as videos shared on YouTube, nearly double the 36% of CEOs who engaged this way back in 2010.  ""These chief executives understand that their role does not change as storyteller-in-chief in the social age, it's just a matter of how do you participate through company-owned properties rather than personal properties,"" Perry said. ""They understand they have to be a leading voice, but they don't think they have to spend their time amassing followers.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/china-51-million-2012/,China's Online Population Rises by 51 Million in 2012,"China has added 51 million new internet users in the last year, the Associated Press reports citing data from the China Internet Network Information Center. Compared to 2011, China's internet user population rose 10 percent, bringing the total number to 564 million. That's more than the entire population of Russia and the U.S. combined.  The increase is largely due to a surge in mobile web surfing. The number of Chinese web surfers who access the internet from mobile phones, tablets and other wireless devices, rose 18.1 percent in 2012 to 420 million.  China's huge web usage growth comes despite the government's measures to prevent access to a large number of online services.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/chrome-beta-voice/,Chrome Beta Gets Voice Dictation Support," Soon, you will be able to craft emails in Google Chrome using only your voice. Google updated the beta feed of its Chrome browser Monday with developer support for the Web Speech API.  The Web Speech API is a JavaScript API that lets web developers integrate speech recognition into their websites and web apps. Google Chrome has had support for voice search for quite some time but as the Google Chrome blog points out, more robust dictation support could open up a lot of other opportunities. Google built a demo showcasing the new API support in the new Chrome Beta that lets users compose an email using their voice.  I tested out the feature and was very impressed. Despite being on horribly laggy hotel Wi-Fi, the API worked well and was mostly accurate and fairly fast at understanding my voice. Here's the text output of my voice dictation (which you can watch in the video above): This is a test of Google's web Speech API even know my hotel Internet is notoriously slow I can still dictate what I'm thinking fairly quickly the accuracy is not 100 percent and noticed some problems with the speech to text recognition but I'm a hole for beta
 Aside from confusing ""though"" with ""know"" and getting slow at the end, it's not bad. Because this API is JavaScript-based, it's something we can see working its way down to Chrome for Android — and maybe even Chrome for iOS. I know I'd love to record an interview but also have it auto-transcribe to Google Docs on my phone. Apple added some similar built-in dictation features to OS X Mountain Lion, which works in almost any app or open text field. I can only imagine that Google will be bringing this feature to its Chromebooks in a future update. If you want to get in on the fun or start building support for the Web Speech API in your own sites, check out this article on HTML5 Rocks and download the Chrome Beta here.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/coke-ad-takes-on-obesity/,Coca-Cola Campaign Takes on Obesity," An anti-obesity ad rolled out this week from an unlikely source: Coca-Cola.  The soft drink giant unveiled a campaign that will take on what it's calling ""the issue of this generation."" The first ad in the campaign, the 2-minute spot above, notes that Coke can ""play an important role"" in the fight against obesity. The ad also points out that of its 650 beverages, Coca-Cola now offers 180 low- and no-calorie choices. In addition, the company has introduced smaller-portion drinks which Coke intends to have in 90% of the country by the end of the year. It's unclear whether another ad in the series will run during the Super Bowl. Coke has purchased three 30-second spots during the big game.  In a press release introducing the campaign, Coke cited several anti-obesity initiatives, including nutrition labeling, school beverage guidelines and Coca-Cola Troops for Fitness, which offers ""military-style fitness classes like calisthenics, sit-ups, push-ups, pull-ups and other fitness and nutritional techniques to families in communities most in need of wellness services."" The push comes after the Center For Science in the Public Interest has been a vocal critic of Coke, linking its soft drinks to obesity and diabetes. In November, that organization worked with Alex Bogusky, a former adman who created ads for Coke, on ""Real Bears,"" which featured a polar bear family rejecting soda after they got obese and sick from drinking it.  Bogusky on Monday took to Twitter to criticize Coke's latest campaign:  Tagline contest! Science says Coke doesn't = happiness. nbcnews.to/XNrp9F So what's the new tag? ""Coke: None of this shit is our fault."" — Alex Bogusky (@bogusky) January 14, 2013 Meanwhile, the Michael Jacobson, executive director of the CSPI offered the following statement about the campaign on its Facebook Page: ""They're trying to stem the tide of criticism by taking a page out of crisis control 101, which is to pretend like they're concerned about the issue. If they were serious, they would stop advertising full-calorie drinks, charge less for lower calorie options, and stop fighting the soda tax. They're just running feel-good ads aimed at neutralizing criticism."" What do you think of Coke's new campaign? Let us know in the comments. Image courtesy of YouTube, Coca-Cola "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/college-hoops-wheelchair-student/,Hoops Star Saves Wheelchair-Bound Student From Post-Game Melee,"College basketball star C.J. Leslie scored 25 points to lead North Carolina State to an upset win over perennial power and in-state rival Duke on Saturday, but his most impressive feat came immediately following the game.  In a story that's become an online hit with sports fans this week, Leslie actually saved a wheelchair-using student from State fans' wild post-game storming of the court.  Here's how it went down: Student Will Privette was one of hundreds to storm N.C State's home court immediately following the big win, but he was the only reveler in a wheelchair. This YouTube video shows the bumrush, and if you look closely, you can see Privette being wheeled out at turbo speed by a friend.  He was knocked over in the chaos amid a crowd of oblivious, out-of-control students. Luckily, Leslie — in the middle of the celebration — spotted Privette on the ground, lifted him up and carried him outside the melee.  A photo of Leslie's good deed then went viral online.   Privette was unharmed, and he and Leslie actually continued the celebration on their own from a safer distance.  “I was originally just going to put him back in his chair. But when he got in my arms, he started cheering, so I was like, ‘Wow,’ so I just kept cheering with him,” Leslie told Today.com. “It was about a good three or four minutes where he was in my arms, and we started cheering together. “After that, I had to put him down because my arm was getting a little tired,” he added. Privette also told Today.com that rushing the court on wheels was his idea, and that the person pushing him was, in fact, N.C. State's student-body president. A video that Privette shot on his phone shows the scary incident from his perspective:   Thumbnail image courtesy of Getty Images/Getty Images Sport/Grant Halverson "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/color-scheme-tools/,10 Tools for Creating Brilliant Color Schemes,"Adobe Kulers' user-friendly, versatile, cloud-based interface creates a slick experience. It's built around three core principals: Users can browse, build and share color schemes through the site, desktop (Adobe Air) app or (Mac OS X) Dashboard widget. It's also available inside the Adobe CS4  Creative Suite applications.  You can search color schemes by color, concept, hex values, tags and more. The ability to create a scheme based on the colors of an image you upload is also an incredibly useful feature. Once you've settled on your color combination, download it as an Adobe Swatch Exchange file or by simply accessing the color table values. 
 COLORlovers is much more than a color scheme designer; it's an active, creative community of people passionate about color, a place to discuss color-related topics and create and share colors, palettes, patterns and the latest trends. At present, it boasts 6.2 million colors in 2.6 million color palettes created and shared by its users.  Of special note is Copaso, an advanced color palette tool that lets you create beautiful color schemes and custom themes. Pick colors from a color wheel or upload an image and optionally pixelate it to isolate particular colors. Furthermore, the impressive community has generated a useful search facility to find colors and palettes. With ColoRotate, explore colors and select color combinations by generating color palettes in real time 3D, just as the human brain perceives color. It's available free online or as an iPad app, and can connect to Adobe Photoshop CS5 or CS6 to update foreground and background colors and send palettes to your desktop.  The interactive 3D color pyramid is fun and intuitive to use and enables you to vary the color hues or tints, as well as blend two colors simultaneously. You can check how your chosen palette works with typography, browse through a selection of palettes and export your own color palette in various formats.  The interface of Color Scheme Designer is incredibly simple to use, which means you can start creating a color palette in seconds. There are a wealth of options in the type of scheme you require, from monochromatic to accented analogic. These affect the number of colors used in the palette and also how the colors interact with one another. If you're not familiar with these terms, go to Help and click Tooltips to display an explanation of each part of the interface.  Along with the ubiquitous color picker, there are several other options to fine tune your palette, or if you choose Adjust Variants, you can edit colors individually. The color-blind preview is particularly useful to simulate how people with common color vision deficiencies will see your color scheme.  You can export your palette in a variety of formats, with the text option offering the greatest flexibility.
 Built by the team at MailChimp, Pictaculous generates a dedicated color palette from your uploaded image. It creates a primary palette of five colors, out of the colors directly extracted from that image. It pulls in color suggestions from both Adobe Kuler and ColorLovers, so you can quickly check color combinations. One great strength of Pictaculous lies in the fact you can snap a picture with your mobile, email it and the service will generate a matching color palette, including hex codes. This is particularly useful if you spot some inspiration on the go, and want to quickly create a color palette from the snaps.  All palettes can be downloaded as Adobe Photoshop Swatch Files or by simply copying the generated hex codes. ColorBlender's main feature is to generate a six-color ""blend"" from your chosen base color, making it easy and efficient to create a complementary color scheme. To start, select a preferred color using the color picker, then a six-color matching palette is automatically calculated. If you would like to take more control over your palette, you can choose to edit colors individually by switching to ""Direct Edit."" In this mode, you can select any of the six color swatches and edit the color using the RGB sliders. There are several options to export your palette, either as a Photoshop Color Table (.ACT), via email or you can bookmark the palette in your web browser for future reference.  ColorExplorer is packed full of useful tools for designing and working with color palettes. It has a well-organized set of features, which can be used individually or together. You can jump straight into the Color Picker, try the color matching tool using the traditional RGB mix or take the hue, saturation and lightness approach. There are eight color-matching algorithms to experiment with, which use scientific and theoretical models, or you can explore the color libraries and analysis and conversion tools. The color import extracts a palette from an uploaded image or from HTML, CSS or text files to evaluate and work with colors. Native Adobe Swatch Exchange (.ASE) allows for export to Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. Export is also available as plain text or a PNG overlaid, with RGB values and HTML color codes.  Colors on the Web is a dedicated resource to color theory and the importance of colors within web design. Of particular note is Color Wizard, which lets you start with a base color and returns a matching color palette. What started as an ASP application back in 2000 is now a full flash app with enough features and variations to create a complete palette. Along with generating a matching five-color palette from your base color, the application returns a set of hue, saturation and tint and shade variations. You can also generate a random color palette if you are having trouble creating your own. Colors are outputted as hex code values. ColorMunki offers solutions to color control for both photographers and designers. Usually this is as hardware; however, it also offers a Palette Creation Area free on its website. It provides introductory functionality to get you started creating your own color scheme.  You can generate palettes from either the Munsell or PANTONE Goe coated color systems. Once you select a color, clicking on it will give you a list of options, including ""Add Patch,"" which adds that color to your palette. From there, you can view similar and harmonious colors, save it for reference or download it (as a CSV file). It also gives you the ability to search user-submitted palettes using keywords. Perhaps the simplest tool listed here, that doesn't mean 0to255 is any less useful. Instead of spending an age manually finding lighter or darker shades of your chosen color, 0to255 allows you to find colors in the same spectrum as one another, within seconds. Ideal for finding that perfect hover, border or gradient color.  Start by picking a color, enter its hex value, and you will be presented with a range of colors from your chosen color through to black and white, using an interval optimized for web design. Once you've found a color you like, simply click on it, and the hex code is copied to your clipboard.
 Color is one of the hardest aspects of design to master. The infinite number of combinations means it can be a frustrating process to decide on a palette that perfectly suits your requirements. The color scheme you choose will affect the entire design, so be sure to dedicate plenty of care and attention to color management.  SEE ALSO: 10 Completely Useless Websites We Found in 2012

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/computer-fraud-and-abuse-act/,Is it Time to Reform the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act?,"Before 26-year old programmer Aaron Swartz took his own life late last week, he was being charged with computer fraud and other crimes and facing jail time under a 1986 law called the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). That act, written before Swartz was born but amended several times since, has become a subject of intense debate following Swartz's death. Swartz was arrested in 2011 after sneaking into a Massachusetts Institute of Technology network closet to use the school's JSTOR access to download a massive amount of academic research. He was later charged under the CFAA, which in part makes it illegal to ""intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access, and thereby obtain ... information from any protected computer.""  The charges against Swartz could have put him behind bars for up to 35 years and cost him $1 million in fines. A Wall Street Journal report said government prosecutors might have only sought a maximum of seven years but were willing to work down to less than a year in a plea deal that was ultimately rejected. Some legal commentators have been citing Swartz's case as an example of why the CFAA needs to be reformed. Marcia Hofmann, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, published Monday a scathing critique of the CFAA. Hofmann argued the law doesn't clearly define ""authorization,"" giving prosecutors plenty of wiggle room to use CFAA in cases that ""aren't really about hacking a computer."" Hofmann pointed to United States v. Drew as an example, in which a woman created a faux MySpace profile to bully a young girl, who later committed suicide.  ""No crime made the bullying itself illegal, so prosecutors charged Drew under the CFAA, claiming her fake profile violated MySpace's terms of use, which made her access to the social networking site's computers 'unauthorized,'"" wrote Hofmann. ""An obvious problem with this argument is that it would mean anyone who runs afoul of a web site's fine print is a criminal — and many of us intentionally or unintentionally violate those agreements every day.""  Hofmann's second critique of the CFAA — and one that's shared by many of those who have commented on Swartz's circumstances — is that the legal penalties are ""harsh and disproportionate to the magnitude of offenses."" While Hofmann acknowledged a report that the government ""might only seek seven years at trial,"" she argued that time is still ""a wholly disproportionate penalty for Aaron's alleged actions."" SEE ALSO: Technology's Greatest Minds Say Goodbye to Aaron Swartz
 Jennifer Granick, director of Civil Liberties at The Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School, wrote in a detailed analysis of CPAA, its history and its future post-Swartz that ""another way of looking at the CFAA, is that it protects the box, regardless of other social values or laws regarding the information residing there.""  She continued: Our laws try to balance the protection of information with other social goods, including freedom of expression and the public's right to know. So copyright is conditioned by fair use. Trade secrets are specifically defined and only protected against misappropriation. Classified information must be marked, and there is a cultural and legal history that enables news organizations and journalists who report on such issues to continue to operate. The CFAA doesn't care about any of that nuance. There's a bright line protecting the box, and even otherwise public data stored on the box is thereby subject to the system owner's control. Animosity toward the CFAA and the prosecutors using it to prosecute Swartz hasn't been unanimous among commentators. Orin Kerr, a professor of law at the George Washington University Law School and Drew's legal representation in the previously mentioned Myspace bullying case, wrote that he believed the ""charges against Swartz were based on a fair reading of the law,"" ""none of the charges involved aggressive readings of the law or any apparent prosecutorial overreach"" and ""all of the charges were based on established caselaw."" ""Indeed, once the decision to charge the case had been made, the charges brought here were pretty much what any good federal prosecutor would have charged,"" wrote Kerr.  SEE ALSO: MIT to Investigate its Role in Aaron Swartz Case
 For Granick, who responded to Kerr in a separate blog post, it's exactly the CFAA's history that shows it should be changed. ""The CFAA is shockingly broad,"" Granick wrote. ""Prosecutors shouldn't file CFAA cases just because they can under existing case law. To the contrary, this is why the CFAA should be amended and narrowed.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/crazy-blind-date-app-okcupid/,OkCupid Wants to Send You on a Crazy Blind Date,"Online dating services want you to spend less time on your couch and more time meeting potential partners. The latest scheme? From the founders of OkCupid, a mobile app called Crazy Blind Date that serves up just what its name implies. Here's how it works: After downloading the app to your iOS [iTunes link] or Android [Google Play link] device, you'll be asked to choose a picture of yourself, which the app will then divide up and scramble, Rubik's Cube-style, to distort your identity. (You can rearrange the tiles to make your facial features a little more distinct, if you wish.) You'll also hand over your age, gender and sexual orientation, or you can connect your OkCupid account to import that information automatically. Next, you'll tell Crazy Blind Date when you're available and a few locations you'd be open to meeting at (say, 7 p.m. tonight at a bar in lower Manhattan). If a match is found, the app will message you to confirm the place and time. A half hour before the date is set to start, an anonymous chat window will appear so you can find your date (and help your date find you).  A few hours after the meeting, Crazy Blind Date will send you a request for feedback — and here's where the app's monetization strategy kicks in. If you had a good date, you'll be encouraged to give your date kudos: one kudos ($0.99) if you liked your date, and 10 kudos ($2.99) if you really liked him or her. The more kudos someone has, the higher he or she will be positioned in the dating queue. OkCupid co-founder Sam Yagan is betting that women will be the ones to pay for this, at a ratio of about 3:1. Whether or not the dates give each other kudos, they still have the option (if both parties agree) to message each other to set up a second date. Yagan says the app isn't so much designed to help people meet their life partners as to enable them to have fun. ""A lot of dates aren't going to work, but you are going to meet someone interesting,"" Yagan told Mashable in an interview last month. ""And you're going to have a lot of stories.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/curiosity-rover-first-drill-mars/,Curiosity Rover's First Drill Site Is Full of Martian Puzzles,"The Curiosity rover will soon drill for the first rock sample in an area that NASA scientists call a ""candy store"" of Martian terrain. Full of flat rocks with puzzling veins, the site may explain the wet history of Mars.  NASA says this will be the most significant thing Curiosity has done since her perfectly timed landing back in August. Therefore, the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) team will take their time drilling and analyzing this history-laden area in Yellowknife Bay, which is located in a very low point of the Gale Crater.  ""Scientists are ecstatic about the kinds of things we are seeing in this area,"" says MSL project manager Richard Cook.  This site especially is interesting because it's filled with different types of sedimentary rock, signaling that Mars is geologically active. As the image below from Curiosity's Mastcam shows, the rocks are covered in whitish veins that tell us water moved through these networks. ""This is the first time on this mission that we have seen something like this,"" says project scientist John Grotzinger.   Researchers used the rover's Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) to examine the diverse range of rocks in this area. Some are sandstone with peppercorn-sized grains, while others are siltstone with grains that have a texture similar to powdered sugar. According to MAHLI deputy principal investigator Aileen Yingst, grain size is important because it tells us strength of transport mechanism. ""The stronger the transport, the larger the grain,"" she says.  Also notable is that, in this case, many of the grains are rounded. This tells us that they were ""knocked around"" during their formation, indicating that a fluid transported these grains. The rover will drill a hole about 5 centimeters deep, retrieving a powdery sample that she will then send to her on-board chemistry lab. The first sample, about the size of half an aspirin, will be used to clean Curiosity's ChemCam instrument (in order to avoid contamination from Earth materials). It will take a couple of days for cleaning and a few weeks to analyze the samples, according to Yingst. SEE ALSO: How the Mars Curiosity Rover Works
 ""When it comes to drilling we just happen to be in a really sweet spot to do that,"" says Grotzinger. ""There will be discoveries that we'll make that we have never thought of before [...] We've got some really good stuff here to look at."" The team first spotted this area from orbit, noting its particularly interesting thermal inertia data. Later, on sol (that's a day on Mars) 120 and 121 of Curiosity's mission, scientists observed drastic temperature changes as she crossed the boundary into Yellowknife Bay. Suddenly, the lows were lower, and the highs were higher.  ""It's like we entered a whole different world,"" says Grotzinger. ""We don't know what's causing this change. We couldn't have predicted any of this stuff from orbit, and we can't wait to get drilling on this stuff."" The rock chosen for drilling is called ""John Klein,"" a fitting tribute to former Mars Science Laboratory deputy project manager John W. Klein, who passed away in 2011.

Disney executives announced on Tuesday in Los Angeles a new gaming platform that does just that  — and even features real-life game pieces that make it come alive.  Disney Infinity, which is currently in development with Avalanche Software and will debut in June, will feature 17 plastic characters — and 40 interactive pieces — from both Disney and Pixar movies to power the game. The toys will focus on upcoming film Monsters University, as well as The Incredibles and Pirates of the Caribbean. It will also come with a base, so when figures are placed on top, they can play certain experiences. Meanwhile, each film has its own Playset (or gaming universe) that can combine up to three characters from other films.    However, the company stressed its more of an interactive gaming platform than just a typical game. Disney Infinity will come to gaming consoles such as Xbox 360, Playstation 3, Wii U and Wii systems, and will also come to mobile and online platforms, as well.   Disney is facing some tough competition in the interactive toy market. Activision's Skylanders franchise, released in 2011, also combines collectable toys with a video game for a unique interactive experience. Activision announced Monday the franchise had grossed more than $500 million in the U.S. since launch. Image by Mashable "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/dr-oz-social-health-verticals/,Dr. Oz Says Sharecare Is Facebook With Health Info,"When you don't feel well, or need to find a doctor in your area, do you check Google first? The Internet has become the go-to place to look for medical information for 35% of U.S. adults, according to the latest Pew Internet and American Life Project Health Online 2013 report.  Half of those who searched for medical information online sought out a doctor's opinion as a follow-up as well. But what if you could do both at the same time?  With 59% of U.S. adults saying they looked for health information online within the past year, it seems whether for convenience, ease of use, free opinions or any number of reasons, people are gravitating to the online world when it comes to finding out about their health. That's why Jeff Arnold, the founder of popular site WebMD, is so excited about Sharecare.  I sat down with him after the Digital Health Summit at the International CES last week to learn more about the social platform, and why cardiologist and TV personality Dr. Mehmet Oz  is a partner and huge fan.   Photo via Peter Sylvester Jeff Arnold says his goal with Sharecare was to form partnerships and humanize health in a way that would have a measurable impact. So he created a site that lets people find health experts, connect and share stories, and get information on topics ranging from the flu to autism. He's working with hospitals and companies to help educate consumers and wants Sharecare to be the place people go to search for health info. The fact is though, when you look at the Pew survey results, most people start their search for health care at a search engine. They don't necessarily head to one of the health verticals.  That's probably because people don't engage with health on a daily basis, usually just when they're sick and need information. The question is, will they trust social health sites to give them safe, reliable information and recommendations? SEE ALSO: Internet Is First Stop for Many Ill People, Study Finds
 Dr. Oz sees Sharecare and other health verticals as a ""Facebook with health info."" It's a place people can go to get information, share and engage. He tells me there needed to be a ""playful, fun, uplifting way to get the public engaged in health.""  Not all doctors have their own TV show, of course, and not many even have the social expertise to create their own Facebook page to engage with patients. Sharecare allows them to get referrals by answering questions and to communicate with a broad array of potential clients. When people looks for answers, Dr. Oz says, ""they want concise, clear info they can trust.""  Sharecare is expanding, having just launched the HealthMakers 250 video channel, which is an online library of over two thousand videos by prominent health figures.  Jeff Arnold says getting info on the site is like building your own virtual medical team and, with this technology, it seems there is the potential for much more. Patients will be able to schedule appointments online, exchange messages through email and, as Dr. Oz put it, ""create an experience where you feel like you control your body and take away intimidating elements.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/facebook-graph-search-great/,Facebook Graph Search Could Be Its Greatest Innovation,"If you ever used it, you know Facebook Search barely counts as such. It’s absolutely awful. As of Tuesday, however, it’s about to go from zero to hero. To understand how fundamentally better Facebook’s new Graph Search will be, just spend five minutes using the current excuse of a search engine. Yes, that’s right, it stinks.  Sure, there’s some word-wheeling in there — where suggested results start appearing as soon as you type a few letters — but the quality of the results ain't great. it’s just an endless number of Facebook pages that have little relation to your query. When I type in ""friends in NY"", my top result is ""Best Friends Animal society – New York City."" Second is ""Friends in Deed."" Scrolling through all the results, there’s nothing that relates to me or my existence on Facebook. Facebook’s Graph Search, though I hate the name, promises to change all that. Based on what we learned today, I’m inclined to believe it.  Graph Search uses all that data we've been pouring into Facebook for the last eight years — all that wonderful structured data — and lets you search against it in pretty much any way you can imagine. According to Facebook’s promotional video and CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s presentation, you can type in real-world, real-language questions you might ask for instant and useful answers. Two examples Facebook gave clearly illustrate the power: So you could start with a simple search like ""Find friends who work at my company."" That’s nice, but then Facebook lets you add in “who like to ski” — a cross reference of the graphed data to get some truly interesting results.  Naturally, these searches work with all the assets you drop in Facebook, making a search like “photos of my friends before 1995” a rewarding experiencing. This may be the first Facebook innovation in a while that excites small business, since users will now be able to search for local firms that their friends like. They get to cross reference interests, too — so if they like the right kind of food in the area, that result is more useful.  I’m sure it will help big brands on Facebook, too. Most of their structured data is public, and I expect to see a lot more serendipitous discovery of brands, services and products that fit your needs. You'll notice the focus on Likes. That’s right, sentiment is now part of the search engine. Facebook’s secret sauce. It’s a key component and the one that should make Google, which has been struggling to integrate Google+ and its +1's with its own world-leading search engine, very nervous. I suspect that Facebook’s Graph Search will be powerful enough to cause Facebook a world of privacy trouble. No, Facebook isn't changing any of its privacy policies for the new search, but once you have a super-easy-to-use tool that can unearth previously hidden or hard-to find information, people are going to freak out a little. Nothing you have set as private will appear, but everything you forgot to set as private (or simply forgot you ever posted and left as public) will appear.  Try not to freak out, and don’t blame Facebook. This is something the service has to do, and it is going to make Facebook a million times better. I suggest that you prepare for it by carefully combing through your Timeline and privacy settings to ensure that everything you want private is now private.  You may also want to ask some friends to un-tag you on, ahem, certain photos. We don’t know everything about Facebook Graph search. For instance, pretty much all the examples and explanation we got talks about Facebook’s meta, interest and connections information about you: who you are, where you work, what you like, who your friends are. There was no mention of status updates.  Can Facebook Graph search within posts? To do so, Facebook would have to index every word in every update and do keywords searches. They’d still apply the same privacy settings, but the results would be even more fascinating for a query like ""Friends from Palo Alto who said they like sunshine and wish the Oscars weren't four hours long in 2004.""   That’s a much heavier lift, and probably not something Facebook’s still-in-beta Graph Search is ready to do, but they could be on their way. Microsoft’s search engine, Bing!, is integrated, after all. For now, Bing Integration sounds more like another room in the house, rather than a new sink or oven. It lets you search the web outside Facebook and bring the results inside. That may annoy the heck out of Google, but it will not change your world all that much — yet. Overall, I’m far more excited about Facebook’s latest announcement than I thought I’d be. No, it’s not a new phone (you do not need a Facebook phone) and it’s not Zuckerberg stepping away to become a philanthropist (too young), but it is the thing Facebook needs the most.  Facebook’s Graph Search will be a game changer on so many levels — and could be just the thing the social network needs to reach even greater heights. Photo by Mashable "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/facebook-graph-search-journalists/,How Facebook Graph Search Can Help Journalists,"Facebook says its new Graph Search functionality has the potential to become a reporter's left hand. As journalists are always on the hunt for new sources and pictures to accompany stories, the social network's latest smart search features could reveal a wealth of opportunities for uncovering new information. Perhaps the biggest areas for members of the media include sifting through public photos on the site and looking for experts. Facebook announced on Tuesday a new and improved internal search system, allowing users to look within their own social graph for specifics — from revealing which friends like certain TV shows or which pictures were taken by friends in, say, New York City.
 
""The new search enables journalists to do richer searches when trying to find an expert for a story,"" Facebook said in a blog post. ""For example, say you’re doing a story on a specific company and you’re looking to interview someone who works at the company in their New York office, you could do this by searching for 'People who work at ACME Inc in New York' to find potential employees to reach out to."" Reporters can narrow the search even more to find those that work at the company with a specific title, and do the same when looking for pictures. SEE ALSO: Facebook Graph Search Could Be Its Greatest Innovation
 ""With more than 240 billion photos on Facebook, Graph Search makes it easier to find public photos and filter the results, such as finding photos posted within a specific location (as broad as photos within a city to photos posted at a specific landmark based on location tags from users),"" the company said. ""This could serve as a great tool during breaking news situations or even to conduct research about a location to get a sense of what it appears like visually."" For example, Facebook describes how using the site during the 2012 London Olympics could been a key tool for finding images: ""If you were a journalist covering the story, you would be able to do custom search (i.e. 'photos taken at Olympic Park') to find photos uploaded within a specific area and reach out to potential sources and, if they provide permission, their photos in your story."" At the same time, Facebook said the move will make it easier for users to follow with journalists by typing in ""journalists"" into the find pages section.  Image via iStockphoto, webphotographeer "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/facebook-graph-search-privacy/,What Facebook's New Graph Search Means for Your Privacy," Facebook on Tuesday introduced ""Graph Search,"" a new search technology that will allow users to find content based on certain criteria — ""tourist attractions in Italy visited by my friends,"" for example.  Graph Search almost immediately sparked questions about user privacy. What will Graph Search mean for your Facebook privacy? People will be able to use Graph Search to find any content that you already share with them. Uploaded some public, geo-tagged photos of the Empire State Building? They're Graph Searchable by anyone and everyone. Like ""Toy Story 3?"" If your likes are public, that like is Graph Searchable by all. Checked-in to Golden Gate Park, but you have your privacy set so only friends can see your check-ins? That's Graph Searchable, but only by your friends. And so on. Ultimately, any of your content that could be discovered before Graph Search will be discoverable after Graph Search, and it will not cause any content to be revealed that wasn't already accessible. ""It makes finding new things much easier, but you can only see what you could already view elsewhere on Facebook,"" reads a Facebook press release.  One important point: Like before, any photo of you that someone else uploads will be searchable per that user's privacy settings. As an example, if a friend uploads a picture of you at a bar, geo-tags it and sets it as public, it will be Graph Searchable to anyone who searches for pictures from that bar. You can, however, make sure to untag yourself or request the uploader of the photo remove it from Facebook or change the privacy settings. To help ensure Facebook users have set their privacy settings to their liking before Graph Search reveals any unpleasant surprises, Facebook has began asking users to ""review who can see your stuff."" You should expect a prompt with that language to appear on Facebook shortly. ""We realize that people are going to care what shows up about them in search,"" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said while unveiling Graph Search. SEE ALSO: Facebook Unveils a Smarter Search Engine

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/facebook-graph-search-sponsored-results/,Facebook Graph Search Puts Spotlight on Sponsored Results,"Google's stock price barely budged on the news of Facebook's Graph Search after investors concluded that the search giant has little to fear from Facebook. That's because Graph Search is more akin to Yelp or Foursquare — at least in its current incarnation — than Google. That's not to say, however, that Facebook isn't going after the search advertising market. Back in August, Facebook released Sponsored Results, its first search ad units. Sponsored Results will pop up when you use Graph Search, according to the Facebook Studio blog.  It's unclear whether another ad unit will replace Sponsored Results. A rep for the company declined to comment. Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst at eMarketer, says she believes Facebook will roll out another search ad unit. She sees two possibilities: Search ads on the right-hand column, and ads that show up in the top, rather than in the second tier, of search results.  Sponsored Results, meanwhile, is a fair stopgap solution. A search for ""dogs"" called up an ad for Porch Potty Pet Supplies, which is logical. But a search for ""cats"" yielded a Sponsored Result for Traily, the personality test that has nothing to do with cats. Nevertheless, the ads are effective. Click-through rates for Sponsored Results ranged from 0.7% to 4.1% in September for a sample measured by researcher Optimal. Even at the low end of that range, that's 10% better than Facebook's Marketplace ads.  Whatever ad unit Facebook winds up using, Williamson points out that Facebook's huge size will make it one of top players in search.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/facebook-graph-search-stock/,Yelp Stock Tanks 8% After Facebook Announces Graph Search,"Facebook's big search announcement appears to have unnerved investors for at least one tech company: Yelp.  Yelp's stock dropped by more than 8% on Tuesday to as low as $20.16 a share after Facebook announced the beta version of a smarter search engine called Graph Search. The new search tool lets Facebook users search for businesses based on their social graph, using queries like ""sushi restaurants that my friends have been to in Los Angeles."" While the feature is still in its early stages, it poses a potential threat to Yelp, a company whose bread and butter is serving as a resource to recommend businesses to consumers. Yelp may have 84 million monthly visitors and tons of 33 million reviews, but Facebook may reduce the incentive to check those reviews if it can quickly suggest a restaurant based on where one's friends have gone. Yelp isn't the only company whose stock dropped right after the Facebook announcement.  IAC/InterActiveCorp, the company that owns Match.com and OkCupid, saw its stock drop by more than 2% as Facebook demonstrated how one could potentially use Graph Search as a dating tool to look up single people in a specific region who are friends with your friends.  LinkedIn's stock also dipped slightly by about 0.3% after the announcement, perhaps in reaction to the fact that Graph Search can pull up job opportunities from your social graph. Facebook's stock, meanwhile, was down by more than 2% in trading as of publication, as investors appeared disappointed the company didn't announce other rumored products like a Facebook phone, operating system, new ad products or a more traditional search engine that pulls up links.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/facebook-graph-search/,Facebook Unveils a Smarter Search Engine,"Now we know what Facebook is building: a better internal search system. Speaking at a much-hyped event at Facebook HQ, founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a raft of improvements to ""graph search"" — that is, the ability to search within your social graph for specifics. The search improvements involve the ability to ask questions in regular English, such as ""which of my friends live in New York?"" The search is now intelligent enough to rank your friends based on how much interaction you've had — so that closer friends will appear higher up the results list. It can also search based on stories or photos you've Liked. One example Zuckerberg offered: the site can now display which of his friends have Liked the HBO show Game of Thrones. You can search for people who Like multiple products or services, which seems likely to be a bonanza for marketers. Photos can also be ranked by which have the most Likes, based on the people most important to you in your Friends list. And one of the most useful use cases appears to be searching for local businesses that have received a thumbs-up from friends (and their friends).  Graph search starts today in beta, and will appear as a large blue search bar at the top of your Facebook page. You can sign up for the beta — or rather, join the Waiting List for a beta invite — here. Zuckerberg was careful to emphasize that Graph Search is a new and limited product. For now, it will focus on four areas: people, photos, places and interests. Here's what it looks like:  ""With Graph Search you combine phrases (for example: 'my friends in New York who like Jay-Z') to get that set of people, places, photos or other content that's been shared on Facebook,"" wrote product manager Tom Stocky and engineering manager Lars Rasmussen on Facebook's official announcement blog post.  ""We believe they have very different uses."" The pair were also careful to assuage privacy concerns: We’ve built Graph Search from the start with privacy in mind, and it respects the privacy and audience of each piece of content on Facebook. It makes finding new things much easier, but you can only see what you could already view elsewhere on Facebook.
 In cases where it can't find anything useful for you, Graph search will default to a web search — powered by Facebook's partner, Microsoft's Bing. Zuckerberg reluctantly revealed that negotiations with Google that would have allowed the search giant access to Facebook results had broken down. Photo: Emily Price, Mashable "

The social network is holding an event Tuesday at its Menlo Park headquarters where it plans to show the press what it has up its sleeve.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/facebooks-graph-search-businesses/,Facebook's Graph Search: What It Means for Businesses,"Facebook's Graph Search isn't just for looking up your old buddies and potential new friends, it's also designed for Business Pages. The company gave the example of a search for ""sushi restaurants that my friends have been to in Los Angeles"" and “TV shows my friends like.” Though these are largely organic results rather than paid ads (""There are no new ad formats available today,"" Facebook noted on its marketer-friendly Facebook Studio blog), Sponsored Stories will show up in searches as will Sponsored Results. Overall rankings will be based on top search suggestions including people, Pages, apps, places, groups and suggested searches. The results are also based on data shared by a business and connections of the person searching. In the blog post, Facebook urged business owners to ""Continue to invest in your Page"" by making sure it's up-to-date. That means updating addresses to show up in local searches and cultivate ""the right fans.""  The post noted that web searches will continue to be supplied by Bing. Though it's possible Facebook will unveil paid search ads at a later date, for the moment the company is sticking to its strategy of encouraging businesses to make more engaging Pages. For brands like Coca-Cola or Toyota, it provides further incentive to cultivate and interact with as many fans if possible, if only to come up first in a search for ""Sodas my friends like"" or ""Cars my friends recently bought.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/federal-employees-pirating/,Federal Employees Still Illegally Download Films and Shows,"When Congress was debating the Stop Online Piracy Act back in late 2011, a report alleged staff at the U.S. House of Representatives were downloading pirated content illegally — the exact practice SOPA was intended to fight.  Fast forward to today, and it seems House employees are still grabbing TV episodes and movies on the digital down-low. Computers in the House of Representatives have been used to download ""dozens"" of films and television shows, according to a report by ScanEye shared with U.S. News and World Report. ScanEye works by tracking IP addresses used to download files via BitTorrent. ScanEye matched IP addresses of downloaders with the House through use of IP-to-location finder MaxMind. BitTorrent is commonly used to pirate content but also used to share legitimate files. However, ScanEye's analysis shows that much of the content downloaded by IP addresses in the House are most likely protected by copyright law: Episodes of popular television shows Glee and Dexter and films such as Lawless and The Cabin in the Woods, for example.  There's even a DVD rip of Life of Pi — which won't be officially released until March 5 — listed in ScanEye's report. SEE ALSO: BitTorrent Surges to 100 Million Active Users
 US News' report notes it doesn't include ""every Congressional office"" — the Senate is notably absent — ""so the number of illegal downloads may be higher.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/final-fantasy-remake-teaser/,Is a 'Final Fantasy' Remake Coming to iOS This Week?,"A mysterious Japanese teaser site appeared Tuesday morning with silhouettes from the Final Fantasy universe and a date of Jan. 17. Fans were left to speculate on social media if the wordless webpage posted by publisher Square Enix was related to a particular game in the Final Fantasy franchise or perhaps a new product entirely. Most of the sprite-shaped silhouettes are recognizable to fans as characters from Final Fantasy VI, originally released in 1994, but a few of the characters could also be from other games.  There is also reason to believe the game is coming to iOS, since Jan. 17 falls on a Thursday, the weekly release date for new iOS games. Square Enix has also been active about releasing Final Fantasy games and other titles to iOS over the last year.  We're reached out to Square Enix, but until then we'll have to wait until Thursday to see this mystery revealed. What do you think the teaser image means? Let us know in the comments.  "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/fotio-photo-booth/,Fotio Is a Photo Booth for Your Party — Minus the Booth," Aside from the free champagne and opportunity to watch your great aunt do the Cha-Cha Slide, photo booths are the highlight of any wedding.  With sombreros, oversized frames and boas, the taking of gratuitous, timed selfies of you and your friends heightens every event. And a Chicago-based company has a new take on the experience with Fotio, a photo booth without the actual booth.  Event planners Nick Harvey and Theresa McMullen created a custom, vintage-inspired view camera shell from solid oak, brass and leather. Hidden inside is a Canon T4i dSLR and a 20-inch iMac, and the subject controls the shutter by pressing a red, wired button. Check out the video, above, for more.  SEE ALSO: New Tool Enables Wireless Tethered Photography
 Instead of prints, the photos are displayed on the iMac screen in random slideshow format, because ""people love posting pictures online and talking about them right after an event,"" Fotio's creators say on their site.  It's intended to be a social experience, where everyone gathers around the screen to view shots of different guests.  ""We are more interested in a truly unlimited photo experience that's more like a photo shoot and gets the craziest and best photos,"" Harvey told Mashable. Fotio was inspired by Harvey and McMullen's DIY photo booth they created for their own wedding.  With Fotio, each guest gets a custom red ticket with information for a password-protected online gallery, which is uploaded within 24 hours. All pictures displayed are black and white but at the end of the event, the party planner receives a USB with files in full color.  Getting Fotio at your next function will cost you $600 for 6 hours.  What do you think of the photo booth experience sans booth? Tell us your thoughts in the comments.

The feed is random and occasionally crass, and we like it that way. Another alum of the Parks and Rec writing room, Mande has a way with captions. While not a comic by trade, Hara has translated his substantial Twitter following into an Instagram audience. Snaps of his neighborhood and kids are always a riot with the right captions.

It’s nothing but clichés!""  On the blog Least Helpful, dedicated to collecting ""daily dispatches from the Internet’s worst reviewers,"" that clueless reader reviews Homer, Zippo lighters, Target and everything else on the Internet.  Homer’s not the only writer from antiquity who leaves modern readers cold. This guy faults Aesop’s Fables for being overly, well, fable-ish:   It’s been almost 10 years since an anonymous seventh-grader wrote this review of H.G. Wells's Time Machine. Hopefully, his understanding of science has matured since then.   Or maybe the reviewer grew up to be this guy:   We can think of many reasons a gay bar might deserve a bad review: nasty-tasting drinks, poor-quality sound system, unfriendly wait staff … but this bar-hopper in Glasgow, Scotland, had a different complaint:   Disclaimer: We’ve owned Zippo lighters in the past, and have bought Zippo lighter fluid too. It’s true that this next review isn’t exactly overflowing with helpful or informative commentary, but seriously, it’s lighter fluid. What else is there to say?   Reviewing a can of compressed air poses similar difficulties:   It’s probably not fair to single out Target in this next example. Corporate retailers in general tend to be pretty laissez-faire about spirits of the undead haunting their stores (even stores that offer a great deal on socks).

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/google-glass-developers/,Google Glass to Hit Developers' Hands This Month,"Developers who want to get their hands on Google’s Project Glass won’t have to wait much longer. Google announced plans Tuesday to hold a “Glass Foundry” in San Francisco and New York in the coming weeks: Two full days of hacking that will allow developers to get an early look at Glass and start developing for the platform. The first day of the event will be an introduction to Glass, while the second will explore the Mirror API, which “gives you the ability to exchange data and interact with the user over REST.” Google engineers will be on site to help developers at any point in the process. At the end of the second day, there will also be the opportunity for developers to show off what they’ve been working on, with some “special guest judges” on hand to take a look at all the entries.  Google co-founder Sergey Brin demonstrated Google Glass during the company’s annual developer conference last year.  The glasses offer the ability to record video, get weather updates, and see messages from your friends. Developers who were in attendance at the conference were able to order Explorer Editions of the glasses for $1,500. Those glasses are expected to ship to developers early this year, however, an exact ship date has yet to be announced. Glass Foundry will be held in San Francisco from Jan. 28 to 29 and in New York from Feb. 1 to 2.  Both events require registration and are available only to a limited number of developers. Developers who take part in the Glass Foundry events will be able to use units on-site. Photo by Mashable, Pete Pachal  "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/greendot-launches-gobank/,"Meet GoBank, the Bank Designed Specifically for Smartphones","Green Dot wants to disrupt the banking industry in the same way that Apple disrupted the music industry.  Green Dot, the largest provider of prepaid debit cards in the U.S., announced Tuesday that it is launching a new bank account called GoBank which is specifically designed for consumers with smartphones.  Rather than partner with an existing banking institution, Green Dot designed GoBank from the ground up to be truly mobile-first. For starters, customers can quickly set up an account from their phone using GoBank's mobile website or apps for Android and iPhone. GoBank members can send money to friends and family for free through e-mails, texts and Facebook notifications.  GoBank has also implemented several novel features that may not be necessities, but will likely appeal to a generation raised on smartphones and social networks. For example, you can customize your debit card with a photo taken from Facebook instead of simply having a bank logo on the card, or you can turn to the Fortune Teller feature in the app to determine whether to make a purchase based on your current budget. The bank, which is FDIC insured, has no branches to walk into or tellers to deal with. Instead, GoBank offers a network of 40,000 fee-free ATMs around the country that consumers can visit to withdraw and deposit funds. Green Dot has also partnered with Walmart, which will accept deposits in stores, and the company hopes to partner with other retailers in the future. ""We have tried to bring everything we always wanted in a bank and take out all the things we hate about a bank,"" said Sam Altman, the EVP of mobile for Green Dot, told Mashable. As part of that effort, GoBank has also eliminated some of the most derided aspects of traditional banks, including overdraft fees, minimum balance requirements and overly complicated fee disclosure forms. In their place, GoBank has just four fees up front and has adopted the Radiohead model of asking users to determine how much they are willing to pay for a monthly fee.  For Green Dot, which went public in 2010, building a bank account was part of its original vision, but it took a long time to develop. Altman says the company made its first effort to purchase a charter bank in Utah in 2010 — a ""long and painful process"" which took nearly two years to complete. Green Dot also held discussions with some existing banking institutions about why they hadn't implemented these steps and whether there was an opportunity to partner in the future, but ultimately, he says, ""no bank wanted to be as innovative as we needed."" In the meantime, a couple other companies have attempted to innovate the banking experience for mobile. Simple, a startup formerly known as BankSimple, launched an online-only bank in 2010 to eliminate fees and work better on smartphones. Likewise, American Express partnered with Walmart last year to launch Bluebird. Altman expects that more startups and larger companies will begin to innovate in this space in the coming years.  Green Dot is banking on the assumption that consumers are frustrated enough with existing big banks and fees to consider switching to a new institution. The hope for Green Dot, which had 4.4 million active prepaid accounts as of last quarter, is that this will significantly expand its customer base. That said, as Altman points out, the new bank account will likely prove less popular among an older demographic who are ""still more comfortable with physical branches and tellers."" But, he says, ""if you live on Facebook and your phone all the time, then we're probably a great choice."" GoBank is currently available in beta and will accept around 20,000 users in the next couple months before launching publicly.  Images courtesy of Green Dot "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/hands-on-facebook-graph-search/,Hands On With Facebook's Graph Search,"Facebook is starting with just a few search criteria in graph Search. in the future, additional variables will be added, for instance, Instagram. With Graph Search you can search for restaurants by type, as well as location. You can also search specifically for restaurants you or your friends like. Searches can be for anything. For instance, I can find out what musicians like Mashable, or even better, what musician's like Mashable and live in my hometown in NC. Photos can be searched for using a variety of factors. For instance, I can search for photos of my friends taken before 1990. I can also get a bit more specific, and ask to view photos of friends before 1990 that were uploaded by a specific person. Photos with friends can be narrowed down by a number of variables. For some reason Graph Search always wants to include our Deputy Editor Chris Taylor as a variable in searches I do. Photos from your search are displayed in the order in which Facebook thinks they would be most important to you. Importance is determined in part by the number of likes and comments a photo has. Searches can include results with content from people you're not friends with as well. for instance, my search for ""Photos taken in Paris, France"" pulled up a number of public photos taken by people I don't know. Facebook has integrated Bing into Graph Search as well. If it thinks it won't find an answer on Facebook it will bring up a web search. web searches stand out with a grey icon beside them. Web search results are displayed directly in Facebook. For searches like weather, the forcecast is shown right in your Facebook menu. Facebook unveiled Graph Search on Tuesday, a new way to search for things you’re looking for on the social network. Meant for uncovering information in your Facebook network, Graph Search can be used to search for something simple like ”Photos of my friends,"" or something more complex like “Photos of my friends before 1990 uploaded by my mom.” The service is in beta now, with only a few hundred people gaining access Tuesday. Facebook will be using results from those initial users to help tweak the service, before it pushes it out to the whole of the Facebook community. As one of the lucky ones granted early access to Graph Search, I took the service for a spin. Check out some of the searches I was able to do on Facebook in the gallery above. What sorts of searches would you like to be able to do on Facebook? Let us know in the comments. "

Dhairya Dand's Cheers is a set of LED ice cubes that change color from green to yellow to red depending on how much you've imbibed. The cubes also send a message to your designated friend if you've passed your limit. Oh yeah, they also light up to ambient music and noise.  As the video above explains, Dand came up with the idea three weeks after he was rushed to the hospital with an alcohol-induced blackout. Soon after he went to work on the project, which employs an LED, an accelerometer, IR transcievers and a battery, and are ensconced in an ""edible and tasty"" jelly cube. The accelerator detects motion and calculates how many sips you've had. That, coupled with the timer cube, provides an estimate to your relatively drunkenness.  The only catch: These cubes don't come cheap. It cost Dand $50 in materials to make them. On the other hand, they don't melt, either.  Image courtesy of YouTube "

In a Pew study released today, 35% of U.S. adults say they've used the Internet to diagnose themselves or someone else. And about half of those people followed up with a doctor's visit.  The Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project released further data that shows how the more than 3,000 U.S. adults surveyed answered. 59% of U.S. adults say they looked online for health information within the past year. One in four people seeking health information on the web encountered a pay wall. Most tried to find the information somewhere else, some gave up on their quest and only 2% paid a fee.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/iran-monkey-space/,Iran Will Try to Launch Monkey Into Space Again,"Iranian space officials announced they will make another attempt to launch a live monkey into space within the next month, according to news reports. ""Testing phase of these living capsules has ended and monkeys to be sent to space are now in quarantine,"" Hamid Fazeli, head of the Iranian Space Agency, was quoted as saying by the country's Mehr News Agency on Tuesday (Jan. 15). ""These monkeys will be sent into space according to a timetable on Fajr Ceremonies,"" Fazeli said, referring to a 10-day period in the beginning of February when the Iranian Revolution is commemorated. He added that the capsule is called Pishgam, which means ""pioneer"" in Farsi. Iran apparently failed in a 2011 effort to launch a live monkey into space. News reports out of the country at that time did not explain what went wrong, but the plan had been to send a rhesus monkey into orbit atop a Kavoshgar-5 rocket. A successful mission this time around would seem to advance Iran's goal of sending a human into space by 2020 and an astronaut on the moon by 2025. ""Monkeys have similarities to humans, so with them in space, we can examine human factors in space,"" Fazeli told Mehr News. 







 Iran has made progress in spaceflight technology in recent years. The country sent its first domestically built satellite into space in February 2009 and launched a Kavoshagar-3 rocket in 2010 that delivered a rat, two turtles and a worm into space. Iran also sent Earth-observing satellites into orbit in 2011 and 2012. Western critics have expressed concern over the potential military applications of Iran's rocket program since boosters developed to reach space could also be used as long-range ballistic missiles. The Islamic republic has denied such ambitions for its space program. In the early days of spaceflight for the United States and Soviet Union, animals were used to test the safety and feasibility of launching a living being into space and bringing it back unharmed. A rhesus monkey named Albert I was the first ever monkey astronaut. It was launched aboard a U.S. military V-2 rocket from White Sands, N.M., in June 1948 but suffocated and died during the flight. A monkey named Yorick was the first monkey to live through a space flight. Yorick and 11 mice were recovered after an Aerobee missile flight of 236,000 feet at Holloman Air Force Base, N.M., in September 1951. Photo courtesy of Flickr, eschipul

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/its-not-a-tumor-schwarzenegger-confirms-on-reddit/,Schwarzenegger Confirms on Reddit: 'It's Not a Tumor',"Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former Governator of California and action megastar of our youth, stopped by Reddit earlier today to answer Redditors’ questions. Schwarzenegger did the AMA session—the popular question and answer format used on the site—to promote The Last Stand, his glorious return to the action genre. Minutes before his session started, Reddit users had already left more than 3,000 questions for the governor, ranging from queries on marijuana legalization to popular lines from his movies. Despite only answering questions for an hour, the IAmA is slated to be one of Reddit's most popular ones, accruing more than 11,000 total karma points as of this writing. We've compiled some of the better Arnold responses below, including some answers he wrote out using his iPad. 1. What role do you most regret turning down? (via Salacious) I most regret not doing The Rock. I love the movie, and it turned out well. When it was offered to me there was only an 80 page script with a lot of handwriting and scribbles and it didn't seem fully baked. But they obviously did a fantastic job. 2. What are your thoughts on the current state of the Republican party? (via y0nkers) The most important thing is that we need to be a party that is inclusive and tolerant. We can be those things and be the party we always have been. We need to think about the environment - Teddy Roosevelt was a great environmentalist and people forget Reagan was the one who dealt with the ozone layer with the Montreal protocol. We also need to talk about healthcare honestly - Nixon almost passed universal healthcare. We need to have an talk about immigration and realize you can't just deport people. We need a comprehensive answer. We also need to stay out of people's bedrooms. The party that is for small government shouldn't be over-reaching into people's private lives. Mainly, we need to be a party where people know what we are for, not just what we are against. 3. Would you rather fight 100 duck sized Predators or 1 Predator sized duck? (via Synanon) I would choose the 1 Predator sized duck instead of dealing with 100 duck-sized Predators. I've already fought a Predator-sized Predator so I am confident I could handle the duck.  4. In your films are all the ""Ayyaagh's"" in the script or do you improvise them? (via dev729) All improvised. Every single one. 5. Politicians are wildly unpopular these days - if you had to pick one current American politician who best embodies what is good about politics, who would you pick, and why? I've always appreciated your perspective on American politics and admired your optimistic spirit, so I'd love to hear your answer to this. (via rycla) Great question. And this has to be my last one. Even though Congress has an approval rating of 9% (and loses to cockroaches and colonoscopies in polling), there are still some leaders who are doing the people's work instead of the partys' work. That's political courage to me, being willing to risk your job to choose what's good for the public instead of getting stuck in your ideology. One of my favorites is Mayor Chuck Reed from San Jose. He's a Democratic who took on pension reform, he has always put the people first. You should look him up. 6. Is it a tumor? (via LGFL5000)  After answering his final question, Governor Schwarzenegger thanked Reddit and its users with a handwritten note and a drawing of the Snoo, the site's mascot alien logo.

But that didn't stop designer Seyook Lee from creating the iWhale, a case that ""mimics the silhouette of a whale coming to the water's surface to breathe,"" according to Yanko Design.   SEE ALSO: Life-Size Lobster iPhone Case Helps You Stand Out From the Crowd
 Surprisingly, the iWhale is more functional than it looks. The case's curved tail allows users to prop up or hang the phone for video-viewing, while its humped back makes the phone easier to hold. There's also space inside to store headphones and other accessories. And to top it all off, the whale's blowhole is a headphone jack. The iWhale costs $23.90, and is available for purchase on Lee's website.  Would you buy this case? How does your current smartphone case look? Tell us in the comments below.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/kickstarter-settlers-hexel/,Kickstarter Campaign Brings Magnetic Board to 'Settlers of Catan'," Fans of the board game The Settlers of Catan will probably agree: the actual board part could use some work. Tim Walsh, a San Francisco-based Catan fan, was fed up with the game's wobbly playing surface. He invented a new set of pieces, called Hexels, and launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds. Now, after a few weeks, he's already met his fundraising goal. Hexels are six-sided magnetic pieces, representative of the 19 ""hexes"" used in the game, that connect to each other to create a sturdier game board (see the image below).   As Walsh puts it: A Hexel ... magnetically connects to each of its neighbors by allowing each magnet to freely orient itself in whatever direction creates the strongest bond. The result is a board that stays together when playing, allows complete modularity, can be used as a storage device, and it all fits into the original box your game of settlers came in. The traditional Settlers hexes are individual cardboard pieces. Each one represents a resource — brick, lumber, wool, grain or ore — that gamers collect and eventually trade in to build roads, cities and settlements. The pieces are arranged randomly at the beginning of each game to ensure every one plays out differently than the last — the lack of a solid structure, however, makes it difficult to keep the board in one place during gameplay.  Hence the appeal of the Hexels' magnetic attraction.    SEE ALSO: 'Settlers of Catan' Gets a New Game Board Thanks to Kickstarter
 This isn't the first Kickstarter project to improve Settlers' board. In November, Mashable interviewed Bill Trammel and Nate Veldkamp, also from California, who designed a single board tray to hold each hex. Their design, along with Walsh's, has been officially endorsed by the game's creators.    Walsh's Kickstarter campaign has already collected $93,664, well past its original goal of $50,000, and will continue until Jan. 21. He estimates the pieces will be delivered to their earliest backers by February.  Would you use this new design to play Settlers? Tell us what you think about it below.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/medfolio-wireless-pillbox/,Wireless Pillbox Sends You Text Message Alerts," Taking medications is often an inevitable part of life for the elderly and those with long-term illnesses. It can be pretty confusing when you have different pills to swallow at multiple times of the day. MedFolio is designed to simplify this process.  The MedFolio Electronic Pillbox offers an organized way to take your medications, with times and days sectioned in each container. Not only can you track your medication one week in advance, but each section also features an LED light that glows when you need to take the pills. The light goes off once the related segment has been removed.   When it's time to take your medication, the light will flash and send audio alarms via email or text message. You can also place all your medications in a list so that they are easy to identify. MedFolio recently added another component to its Electronic PillBox — a wireless version. While the original pillbox will still be available for $248, MedFolio now offers an electronic pillbox that has Wi-Fi capabilities (price is not yet available).  This feature is great for connected family members who want to play a more active part in their parent's healthcare. The box will sync information about the user's medication journey to a secure server, so a family member can check whether or not their loved ones are actually adhering to their medication list.

In fact, the metric for effective cost per thousand impressions (eCPMs) was up 50%, new data suggests. A new report from MoPub — a real-time bidding exchange where advertisers bid on ad inventory from smartphone apps — tracked its network of 30 billion ad impressions in the fourth quarter of 2012 to reveal spikes in mobile ad prices. ""By looking at the fourth quarter — which is the big advertising season — it's evident that mobile is catching up to what we already know is happening,"" said Elain Szu, director of product marketing. ""Advertisers really looked to mobile during the holidays, which validates the channel and the overall marketing trend.""  Click-through rates during the holiday season not only performed well in December, but remained high on both iOS and Android platforms well into January — it even surpassed click-through rates in December.   But iOS saw the biggest spike in eCPMs during the period with 66% higher prices than the beginning of the quarter.

In a new report, research firm Strategy Analytics says more than 200 million mobile workers will be using mobile business apps in 2013. It predicts that the revenue associated with these mobile business apps will increase from $25 billion in 2012 to almost $50 billion by the end of 2017. ""The consumer mobile experience has taught mobile workers to expect, even demand, access to information and applications from anywhere using mobile devices,"" said Mark Levitt, director of business cloud strategies at Strategy Analytics.  ""Mobile workers have moved beyond just mobile email and messaging to include other collaboration apps such as conferencing, productivity apps such as content authoring, and business process apps such as CRM and even ERP."" ""The business imperative for workers to be productive while on the way to, from and at customer and other remote work sites is driving the rapid mobilization of business apps,” added Andrew Brown, the firm’s director of enterprise research. “Growth in secure application distribution through mobile device and application management (MDM and MAM) and Enterprise App Stores is helping to allay security fears and ensure compliance.” Photo courtesy of Flickr, mikecogh

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/nasa-unveils-last-moon-video-by-doomed-spacecraft/,NASA Unveils Last Moon Video by Doomed Spacecraft,"A NASA probe recorded a spectacular flyover video of the moon's far side shortly before intentionally slamming into a lunar mountain last month. NASA's Ebb spacecraft shot the stunning final moon video on Dec. 14, just three days before it and its twin Flow ended their gravity-mapping mission, known as Grail, with a dramatic crash near the moon's north pole. Ebb was just 6 miles above the lunar surface when it captured the images using its MoonKAM (Moon Knowledge Acquired by Middle school students) camera. The probe was skimming over the far side's northern hemisphere at the time, near an impact crater named Jackson. Grail scientists pieced together about 2,400 individual frames to make the nearly two-minute video, NASA officials said. 







 The $496 million Grail mission — short for Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory — launched in September 2011, and Ebb and Flow arrived in lunar orbit about three months later. The washing-machine-size spacecraft spent a year zipping around the moon, detecting the tiny changes in the distance between them caused by lunar mountains, craters and subsurface mass concentrations. The Grail team used these super-precise measurements to construct an incredibly accurate map of the lunar gravity field — the best ever created for any celestial body, researchers said. But Ebb and Flow couldn't keep flying forever. They were running out of fuel by last month and would have crashed into the moon eventually, so the mission team decided to bring them down in a controlled fashion, far from the Apollo landing sites and other areas of historical importance. So on Dec. 17, the two probes slammed into a crater rim near the moon's north pole. Shortly after the impact, NASA announced that the crash site would be named after the late Sally Ride, America's first woman in space. Ride had led Grail's MoonKAM project, which allowed schoolkids around the world to pick out sites for Ebb and Flow to photograph. She died last July at the age of 61 after a battle with pancreatic cancer. Image courtesy of NASA

His grandma, for one, doesn't approve.  That's according to a text message she sent him after his team, Oklahoma City Thunder, beat the Phoenix Suns Monday night. In the message, she congratulated him on the win, but tempered her praise with a side of scolding: ""Kev kev stop cussing so much they be showing u when u do."" Durant shared a screenshot of the message — and his reply — with his 960,000 Instagram followers on Tuesday:  The photo came with an appropriate enough caption: ""sorry grandma lol.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/ncr-paypal-mobile-payment/,NCR Teams With Paypal to Enhance Mobile Payments System,"Point-of-sale giant NCR and Paypal are teaming up to make life a little easier for restaurant-goers. The two companies announced an agreement on Tuesday that will bring the option to pay with Paypal on NCR's recently announced mobile payment app.  In early December, NCR announced the launch of Mobile Pay, a cloud-based system that enables restaurants to give customers a wide array of services, including mobile payments. The idea behind mobile pay is to allow customers to interact with the restaurant through an app on their phone.  ""We can essentially eliminate all the waiting time and all the uncertainty and insecurity by simply letting you to use your phone to interact directly with your guest check,"" said Michael Finley, vice president and CTO of hosted solutions at NCR, in a phone interview with Mashable.  Finley also noted that ""it's important to think of the payment as a small part of this."" What NCR wants to achieve with Mobile Pay is in fact much more ambitious: ""It's almost like you can envision the mobile phone becoming the concierge within the restaurant,"" he said. In fact, in addition to payments, NCR's app will also let users re-order drinks, mark a particularly good dish or share the experience through social media, and in the future, order food before getting to the restaurant.  The deal with Paypal, though, appears to be all about the payment part of the user experience. Paypal will be integrated into NCR's Mobile Pay app and give users the option to use their Paypal account to pay the check at the end of the meal.  The collaboration between NCR and Paypal seems to position the two companies in a good position to compete against Square in the mobile payments market.  SEE ALSO:  How Square's Transparent Office Culture Pays Dividends
 Both companies have a great reach. NCR, which used to be called National Cash Register, has a 128-year history and powers 38% of the top 100 restaurants in the U.S., while Paypal has 117 million accounts worldwide. Finley wasn't able to tell Mashable when the option to pay with Paypal will be integrated into Mobile Pay, but said they're working on it. UPDATE: An earlier version of this article implied that Mobile Pay allowed users to order food before getting to the restaurant, but that feature is still unavailable at the moment.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/new-myspace-opens-to-public-justin-timberlake/,"New Myspace Opens to Public, Riding Timberlake's Coattails","New Myspace — with its drastically different redesign — has left invite-only mode, opening up the revamped social network to the public.  The landing page for New.Myspace.com shows a dapper Justin Timberlake and promotes his new ""Suit and Tie"" single that he released late Sunday night.  Timberlake, who took an ownership stake in the company in 2011, had given the world a sneak peek of New Myspace in September, but now anyone can use the refurbished network.  SEE ALSO: Justin Timberlake Returns With 'Suit and Tie' Single Featuring Jay-Z The modern design features horizontal navigation, and like Pinterest, is heavy on visuals. But Myspace wouldn't be Myspace without a focus on music.  BONUS: The New MySpace — Music Meets Social, Done Right Myspace is all-new, and it's all about making music social. The new site is backed by Justin Timberlake and incorporates many elements of modern web design, particularly an emphasis on visual media. Although the site excels at discovery, its iconography is sometimes perplexing. Myspace's design is based on a horizontal scroll, which incorporates a news feed of your updates and those of other users and artists you're following. Cover photos must be high quality, and your playback queue (seen on the bottom) is always present. If you mouse over the queue, as in this screenshot, album covers appear. Setting up your profile thankfully doesn't take long, and you can use your Twitter or Facebook accounts to log in. You can also log into the new site with your ""MySpace Classic"" info. Myspace asks a little about your background and interests, which determines the areas on the site where like-minded users can find you. The new Myspace keeps privacy settings simple, at least for now. Finding artists and songs to connect with is easy once you figure it out. The site encourages you to create and share playlists, called Mixes. You can make them private, too. Just start typing anywhere, anytime on the site to begin a search -- very convenient. Not sure where to start on Myspace? Browsing people in your area or who share your interests is as good a place as any. You can browse the users and artists you've connected with very easily. The site's layout is clean throughout. The Trending page has many articles on various entertainment topics, but would probably be better served by an aggregator. Here's what an article looks like -- very similar to the news apps in Windows 8. Myspace puts the focus on what you're sharing in any moment, pushing the rest of the site to the background. The icons that represent the nature of your connection with people are a little confusing at first, though the ""affinity"" you have with someone else is arguably more helpful. Videos take up you're whole browser window, but if you navigate away they get reduced to a smaller pop-up window, with no interruption in playback. Myspace's clever 404 page, which includes a Mix.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/new-operating-systems-smartphone/,Underdog Operating Systems to Shake Up Smartphone Scene,"The next time you go shopping for a smartphone, you might see some unfamiliar software on the screens lining store shelves. The smartphone market is dominated by Apple’s iPhone and devices running Google’s Android software, with Microsoft and RIM hoping to carve out the remaining market share for their new Windows Phone 8 and Blackberry 10. But several completely new operating systems will soon be available. Manufacturers, carriers and other parties have realized how important the mobile operating system is in providing control over the modern computing experience. Apple and Google are able to sell apps and digital content through the stores tied to their mobile operating systems, causing users to become “locked in” to their ecosystem of hardware and software. Now, competitors—and some free-software proponents—hope to capture some of the same success, or at least stop the two juggernauts from gaining too much power. They recognize that an environment dominated by just two players could stifle innovation and give the leaders too much power over carriers, handset makers, and users themselves. Today, according to IHS iSuppli, close to 46% of cell-phone users worldwide have smartphones, and 87% of those phones run either Google or Apple software. Both handset makers and carriers want more options, says David Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School. Yoffie notes that Android was originally seen as an unbiased player with no hardware or sales revenues from handsets—a software “Switzerland”—but Google’s purchase of Motorola’s handset business makes the software more threatening to other hardware makers, and he believes this is leading a number of them to consider alternatives.  New entrants include Tizen, a platform that’s supported primarily by Samsung and Intel; Firefox OS, created by the Mozilla Foundation, which makes the Firefox web browser; and a version of the free, open-source Ubuntu Linux operating system designed for smartphones. There are also several efforts under way to revive Hewlett-Packard’s critically acclaimed webOS. While Android can be modified, its development is still controlled by Google. So an alternative could make it easier for a carrier, or a technology giant like Samsung, to show off its own services and content—potentially helping it gain a more substantive relationship with smartphone buyers. Even with interest from smartphone makers and wireless carriers, any would-be mobile operating system faces the challenge of establishing a healthy application ecosystem. Tizen, Firefox OS and Ubuntu are all counting heavily on web-based HTML5 apps, which they hope will make it easier for developers to make apps that can work on multiple platforms. This could encourage more coders to support nascent operating systems. Tizen, which grew out of Nokia’s MeeGo platform and (like Android) is based on the open-source Linux operating system, may have the best chance of success. Along with Samsung and Intel, its supporters include the wireless carriers Sprint, Vodafone and NTT Docomo; electronics maker Panasonic; and the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei. The software is still under development, but a video of a Tizen developer conference held last year shows novel features such as 3D-type effects (photo browsing takes on the look of a spiraling cascade of images, for example). The Mozilla Foundation and Canonical, the company behind the Ubuntu operating system, are both likely to be hoping that their alternatives will provide a more open mobile environment where no companies dominate. Firefox mobile apps are essentially web pages, and the Firefox team came up with ways for Firefox OS to access all the hardware on a smartphone running the software. Even the phone’s dialer acts as an app, says Chris Lee, Mozilla’s product lead for the OS. Lee says Firefox OS phones will be low on built-in memory at about 256 megabytes of RAM, and many will include a microSD slot so users can pop in their own memory card to store music, photos and videos. He adds that the first phones are expected to cost around $100 (in line with lower-end Android smartphones) and will be made by the electronics maker TCL Communication Technology and the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE. These devices are expected to be available in the first half of this year, initially in Brazil, where they will be sold by the wireless carrier Telefonica’s Vivo brand. Strategy Analytics senior analyst Scott Bicheno thinks Firefox’s strategy could pay off, especially in areas where Telefonica has a strong presence.  “There’s still plenty of growth in the rest of the world at lower price points,” he says. However, the developing world also presents a potential problem for the Firefox OS: access to reliable high-speed wireless networks. The OS is highly dependent on its users’ access to the web, but many developing economies still don’t have robust networks. Lee says this is definitely a challenge, but that the OS does allow some functionality offline. Firefox OS has already managed to get some major app makers on board: Lee says it is working with the likes of Facebook, Twitter and Google, along with local app developers in various other markets. Canonical has even more ambitious hopes for Ubuntu. Although it hasn’t publicly named hardware or wireless partners, Canonical project manager Richard Collins says Ubuntu hopes to have between 5% and 10% of the smartphone market by 2016. To reach this goal, Ubuntu is targeting the high and low ends of the smartphone market in the developing world. High-end smartphones running the OS will also be able to act as Ubuntu PCs when docked with a keyboard, mouse and monitor. Collins says the company will work with a hardware manufacturer and mobile operator on getting the Ubuntu phone to market; it aims to ship its first phones by the beginning of next year. Even with a well-stocked app larder, underdog operating systems won’t find it easy to grab major market share. Still, there’s always an opportunity in a market growing so rapidly. While less than half of the world had a smartphone in 2012, IHS iSuppli expects 56% of cellphone users to be swiping and tapping on smartphones by the end of this year.

Read more about Malarious here. The Shelter Pet Project is a collaborative effort between the Humane Society of the United States, Maddie’s Fund and the Ad Council. In a series of PSAs from 2011, the campaign featured hilarious talking animals (via voice-over, not the creepy, computer-generated, mouth-moving kind) to spread awareness about pet adoption. In its ""Dumb Ways to Die"" campaign, Metro Trains Melbourne used humor to help prevent a serious issue -- train injuries, which are alarmingly common in the Australian state of Victoria. The PSA, which has nearly 40 million views on YouTube, shows that gettting hit by a train is one among several dumb ways to die, including selling both your kidneys online and taking your helmet off in outer space. The Harry Potter Alliance is based on a concept from the Harry Potter book series by J.K. Rowling -- that love is the best ""weapon"" we have. Founded in 2005, the Alliance is made up of Harry Potter fans around the world, who spread awareness and fight real-world injustices based on issues found in the series. The non-profit's campaigns are often filled with subtle humor and funny references to HP characters. It raised about $123,000 for Haitian earthquake relief, for example. The ONE campaign's mission is to fight extreme poverty and preventable disease around the world. In this particular video, celebrities make funny predictions for the year 2015, but end on a serious (but hopeful) note -- that we will see ""the beginning of the end"" of AIDS. The Sierra Club, the largest grassroots environmental organization in the United States, created a series of PSAs called ""Coal Will Say Anything."" It uses actual TV and film footage but dubs it with a fictional coal company's big business agenda.  The Norwegian Students' and Academics' International Assistance Fund created this satirical (and catchy) music video for made-up project Radi-Aid. The deeper message is that we need to give aid based on real need, not just good intentions, and that we need to educate ourselves about complex issues. This one isn't as ""laugh out loud"" as the others in this list. Non-profit Water Is Life created this darkly humorous but deeply upsetting video in response to the Twitter hashtag #FirstWorldProblems. (RED) aims for an AIDS-free generation. In this funny, celebrity-filled PSA, we learn about all the things that 40 cents can buy, in other words, the amount of money that buys daily HIV treatments. Laughter is the best medicine, and it might even help cure the world's ills, too. Various organizations use Internet humor to promote serious causes, whether it's fighting AIDS, protecting the environment or promoting pet adoption. Behind the jokes and laughs, however, is the drive to create change. SEE ALSO: Top 5 Non-Profit YouTube Videos of 2012

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/prison-issue-polygraph-youtube/,First Prison-Issue Polygraph Test Posted to YouTube," Footage of a Scottish man successfully passing a polygraph test while denying having murdered his 14-year-old girlfriend is now available on YouTube.  The footage, which was posted to the video sharing site on Sunday, is believed to be the first public record of a convicted killer passing a prison-administered lie detector test and may help to free the convicted man after 10 years in jail. In June 2004, when Luke Mitchell, now 24, was 15, the Edinburgh, Scotland, native was charged with the murder of his 14-year-old girlfriend, Jodi Jones, a crime that he has long professed to have not committed. A Scottish court declared Mitchell guilty 10 months after the arrest and sentenced him to a life in prison. But in April, polygraph tests administered by British Polygraph Association secretary Terry Mullins declared that Mitchell was telling the truth. Knowing all prison-administered polygraph tests are videotaped, Mitchell and his defenders began lobbying for the tape to go public shortly after he stepped out of the chair. Last week, Scottish Prison Service officials granted the two parties permission to air the clip. The 17-minute video was posted on YouTube Saturday, where it's received more than 13,000 views. Their hope is that the evidence will rally enough public support for the Scottish Prison System to reconsider the length—or even the convicted guilt—of the longtime prisoner. Mitchell is seen answering three questions that directly relate to the killing of Jodi Jones: ""Were you present when Jodi was stabbed?""; ""Did you stab Jodi on June 30, 2003?”; and ""Did you know for certain where Jodi's body would be found?"" To all three questions, Mitchell offers a brief ""No."" Mullins said in a statement that he was ""certain of the test result."" ""It's absolute. I can't believe Luke Mitchell was convicted on the evidence that was available."" According to The Independent, Mitchell's case is currently being reviewed by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission, ""which investigates potential miscarriages of justice and can recommend new appeals.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/protect-children-phishing-scams/,How to Protect Your Children From Phishing Scams,"The latest Facebook phishing scam tricks people into thinking they're verifying their Facebook information while actually giving away personal data.  The scam works when a user clicks on what looks like a link from a friend in a tweet or post. That link takes them to a fake Facebook page where they can log in. They are then are asked to verify a bunch of information — that's where the worst damage can occur. The user is asked to enter credit card information, down to the security code.  SEE ALSO: 5 Tips to Keep Spear Phishers Out of Your Inbox  Scams like these are not uncommon. You may be wise enough to know not to give personal details to an unverified account or person online, but do your children?  Caroline Knorr, parenting editor at Common Sense Media tells Mashable ""today's kids who are active online need to develop a 'nose' for phishing scams."" Often, phishing scams come in the form of a letter and seem legitimate, but increasingly, phishing scams are finding their way to social networks. And they're getting more sophisticated.  Knorr says if it looks strange, don't click it. ""But as this scam shows, phishers on social networks can very accurately recreate a legitimate website's page to a T."" It can be confusing for anyone when it seems like a friend is directing you to some content. But there are a few things you can teach your kids (and perhaps learn yourself) when it comes to steering clear of scams.  ""First, be wary of any link that asks you to verify your username and password, or provide other sensitive information. Most trusted businesses will not ask you for this kind of information over email or without notice,"" Knorr said.  Kids should let their parents know if someone requested a social security number or credit card information.  ""Second of all, take a close look at the link itself. Most legitimate businesses handling sensitive information use the Internet protocol HTTPS instead of the regular HTTP address. Phishers will likely not use the secure protocol,"" she adds. ""They will also try to fool you by using a similar, but phony, URL."" Make sure letters in the URL are not missing or words are not misspelled on purpose. And lastly, she says, know your friends.  ""If it seems strange that your aunt or grandfather would share a link to a Gangnam Style parody on their Facebook page, then it's likely they weren't in control of that post!"" Knorr says.

""If you don't see clear evidence,"" said Markus Jakobsson, cybersecurity expert and CTO of FatSkunk, a Silicon Valley anti-mobile malware company, ""what you can do is base it on a hunch and look at who's targeted.""  The malware targeted mostly government networks, diplomatic or research institutions, and critical infrastructures located in countries across all continents. Claudio Guarnieri, a security researcher at Rapid7, an information security company, said that because of the nature of the targets, the operation is ""definitely politically motivated."" That opinion is shared by the researchers at Kaspersky, who wrote in the report that ""the main purpose of the operation appears to be the gathering of classified information and geopolitical intelligence, although it seems that the information-gathering scope is quite wide.""  According to Kaspersky's analysis, Russia and former Soviet countries are the ones hit the most. Jakobsson notes that in these cases, it's also important to see who is not among the victims. There's a big player in the cyber espionage world that seems to have come out unscathed from a global operation that Kaspersky estimates has been ongoing for at least 5 years: China. That detail, coupled with the fact that the motives seem to be clearly political, makes Jakobsson put his money on China, with a caveat. ""Either it's criminal attempts, and then my bets are that it is from Russia, or it's politically motivated and then my money is on China,"" he told Mashable.  Both Guarnieri and Jakobsson, as well as Adam Segal, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, agree that the information stolen by Red October is hardly something that could be easily sold or commercialized, which seems to exclude the criminal motive. Criminal organizations who use malware, explains Jakobsson, normally target a lot of computers and try to steal data that can be then sold in the black market and that has high value. This doesn't seem to be the case. However, not everybody is so sure China is behind the operation. Segal notes that the United Kingdom is missing from the list of victims as well, and the UK might be a country interested in Russian-related intelligence. He estimates that there are eight to ten countries who could have motives to spy on Russian targets, and three to five countries with the technological capabilities to carry out such a complex operation. ""Could have been the Chinese, could have been the Brits, who knows,"" he says. According to Kaspersky, an analysis of the malware itself is not revealing. ""The information we have collected so far does not appear to point towards any specific location,"" the report initially states. However, some of the exploits, ""appear to have been created by Chinese hackers,"" and the Red October ""malware modules have been created by Russian-speaking operatives."" The fact that the malware seems to come from China is hardly a conclusive evidence, said Segal. ""Pieces of Chinese code are often widely available on these black market websites where hackers sell and swap code,"" he told Mashable. However, This could also be an instance where some sort of freelance hacker group is stealing intelligence with the intent of then selling it to a government — although Segal seems to hint that this is a more unlikely explanation.  Of course, all these clues could just be red herrings, designed to mislead investigators, as Kaspersky Lab senior security researcher Costin Raiu noted in an interview with Wired's Threat Level blog.  Guarnieri, who had already seen some signs of Red October in February last year, is more inclined to think Russia is behind these attacks, considering some of the domains used are Russian and some signs seems to point the hackers are Russian-speaking.  Furthermore, he notes, China doesn't have a history of such a widespread and long-running espionage operation with very diversified targets and a unique and large malware framework, but rather multiple concurrent campaigns with different targets and different sets of tools, operated by different people. That being said, he admits, ""it's very difficult to completely exclude China in this kind of context because it's a big player and it's often the protagonist in this sort of attacks.""

 Red October, or in short ""Rocra,"" is still live, and it's been harvesting a wide array of documents and files, including some that seem to be associated with an encryption software typically used by the European Union and NATO, according to Kaspersky. The operation targets computers, smartphones and removable storage devices such as USB thumb drives. The Russian cybersecurity giant has identified hundreds of infections and more than 1,000 malicious modules.  Most of the malware modules are designed to perform different tasks, some are one-time, some are recurrent. A few examples include siphoning all kinds of documents and files, record keystrokes, make screenshots, retrieve Outlook email messages, extract saved passwords, and stealing data from connected phones. Kaspersky was first warned of this campaign by one of its clients — which the company declined to identify.  Red October is just the latest in a string of high-profile cybersecurity attacks uncovered by Kaspersky and other companies in the last few months. Last year, the Russian company revealed the existence of Flame and Gauss (both believed to be developed by the the U.S. and Israel), while Symantec uncovered DuQu.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/rim-blackberry-10-apps/,"RIM Adds 15,000 Apps to BlackBerry 10","Arguably the biggest struggle RIM will have when it releases BlackBerry 10 at the end of this month: making sure there are enough apps on the platform.  So in preparation for the operating system's debut on January 30, the company held a Port-A-Thon this past weekend. The 36-hour event let developers port over their existing apps to the BlackBerry 10 platform, and earn cash -– and developer devices -– in the process.  Starting at 12 p.m. ET last Friday, RIM invited developers to a “porting party” to bring their apps to BlackBerry 10 before launch. Experts of the OS were on hand to help with porting questions. The event actually ran a little long –- 37.5 hours -– but in the end, RIM was able to reach its goal of approving an astounding 15,000 apps over the course of one weekend.  well there you have it.37.5 hours in, we hit 15,000 apps for this portathon.Feel like I've run a marathon.Thanks to all the devs! — Alec Saunders (@asaunders) January 13, 2013 RIM gave developers $100 for each app approved for BlackBerry App World. The first 200 developers to port between five and 10 apps scored a BlackBerry Dev Alpha device, while the first 10 developers to submit more than 10 approved apps received a paid trip to BlackBerry Jam Europe to celebrate the launch of BlackBerry 10. RIM's latest OS is set to debut on Jan. 30. [via The Verge] You unlock a BlackBerry 10 device by swiping up from the bottom of the screen. When you swipe up, the lock screen dissolves into the home screen on the device. Swiping to the side brings up additional pages of apps. You can also navigate through pages of apps by tapping on the scroll bar on the bottom of the screen. Taking a page from Windows Phone, RIM is adding “Active Frames” to BB10. Much like the ""Live Tiles” found in Windows Phone, the frames update with information you can see at a glance. For instance, the weather app will show the current temperature as well as a 7-day forecast, the calendar app shows your next event for the day. BlackBerry Hub can be accessed by swiping across the screen. Contact cards include phone numbers, email addresses and social-networking details. RIM is taking the look and feel of its home screen and bringing it into groups. Active frames make an appearance in groups, allowing you to see chats pertaining to a particular group, people who are a part of the group, and photos that have been uploaded. Pictures change as they are uploaded to the group, so if someone uploads a new one then that image will change on the group's page. Tapping on a person in a group will bring up his or her contact card. Taking photos in BlackBerry 10 starts out much like taking photos with any other OS, with the ability to tap on any portion of the photo to focus on a specific portion of the frame. If a photo you take is blurry, or someone in the picture has his or her eyes closed, you can use the scroll bar on the bottom of the screen to move forward and backward in time to capture the perfect shot. Much like you can adjust a whole picture, you can also pic out individual faces in a photo to adjust. So, if one friend has her eyes closed in a picture, you can just adjust herface in the photo. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/robots-cook-in-restaurant/,Robots Cook and Serve Food in This Chinese Restaurant," Paging C-3PO: there's a job opening with your name on it. Robot Restaurant, in the Heilongjiang province of China, has a staff of 20 robots that cook, serve and entertain its guests. The restaurant opened in June 2012 and has since become a novelty spot in the province's capital.  The robot staff operates through tracks on the floor, which lead from the kitchen and down the aisles between tables. The menu includes dumplings and noodles and is prepared by the robots themselves. After a patron orders, a robot sings near the table while their food is being cooked.        The bots are between four and five feet tall and can display 10 different facial expressions.

 According to the Daily Mail, each machine can work for about five hours after a two-hour charge. But the staff doesn't come cheap: each one costs between $30,000 and $50,000, the Mail reported.  Other restaurants are experimenting with non-human staff as well. In San Francisco, a tech startup called Momentum Machines is hoping to launch a burger joint where all the cooking is done by robots. The company says the machines can crank out more than 360 hamburgers per hour.        Would you dine at a robot-run restaurant? Tell us what you think about it below.

Buzz about the Korean electronics giant was led by exciting product prototypes as well as announcements during the company's keynote at the show. The report, from social media marketing firm Salorix, looked at over 1 million tweets related to CES. While Samsung was the most-tweeted brand, Sony, Panasonic, Lenovo and LG all scored highly as well. Among products, 4K ""Ultra HD"" TVs, smartphones and tablets got the most attention on Twitter. Samsung was the most-talked-about brand for all four days of the show except Day 1, which was dominated by Sony. Although Samsung announced many new products at CES, what generated the most buzz were prototype devices such as its flexible cellphone and curved OLED TV. The company's Day 2 keynote address — whose highlights included an unprecedented 8-core mobile processor and former U.S. president Bill Clinton — fueled its Twitter dominance that day, accounting for about 30% of all CES-related tweets. SEE ALSO: Top 10 Tech This Week, CES 2013 Edition
 However, Samsung was only the third most popular branded hashtag during the show. The top company hashtag was #lookforlogitech, according to the report. Logitech didn't make any announcements at CES 2013, but it did run a product giveaway via Twitter. Per usual, CES played host to many celebrities, and the report cites many as the top CES influencers, including @snooki, @llcoolj, @funkmasterflex, @MCHammer and @Ludacris. Alicia Keys' appearance at Monster Cable's event also generated ""huge buzz."" Did you follow CES on Twitter? How do you think Salorix's findings stack up with what you saw?

The Newtown children got some celebrity help recording the benefit song. Singer-songwriter Ingrid Michaelson lent her voice, while Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club rockers Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth opened their studio to the project.  The song is available digitally on Amazon and iTunes. Proceeds will go to Newtown Youth Academy and United Way of Western Connecticut. Here are the kids recording the track:  ""Music has the power to heal both the listener and the performers,"" Tim Hayes, CBGB owner and executive producer of the song, said in a statement. ""The new arrangement of the song feels as if the young angelic adult voice, Ingrid's, is almost teaching the song to the children."" ""First she introduces it to them, then she is joined by an innocent, yet strong chorus of voices and by the end of the song it is only the children that we hear,"" he says. ""In fact, the children were asked to sing the song as if it was a prayer. That emotion really comes though when the children sing their 'oooos,' which transforms the recording into something truly spiritual.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/scientists-paranormal/,Do Scientists Fear the Paranormal?,"The question has been asked for decades: Why haven’t psychic powers been proven yet? Psychics have been studied for decades, both in and out of the laboratory, yet the scientific community (and the public at large) remains unconvinced. In a recent book, Science & Psychic Phenomena: The Fall of the House of Skeptics, author Chris Carter insists that the reason that psychic powers have not been proven is because scientists are unaware of the research or refuse to take it seriously because “Clearly many scientists find the claims of parapsychology disturbing.” This is a common charge leveled against skeptics and scientists: that they refuse to acknowledge the existence of paranormal phenomenon (psychic abilities, ghosts, etc.) because it would somehow challenge or “disturb” their worldview. Skeptics and scientists, they say, are deeply personally and professional invested in defending the scientific status quo and cannot psychologically tolerate the idea that they could be wrong. This results in a closed-minded refusal to accept, or even seriously examine, the evidence. But is this really true? Do scientists ignore and dismiss claims and evidence that challenge dominant scientific ideas? Let’s examine some recent examples. A study published in 2011 in a scientific journal claimed to have found strong evidence for the existence of psychic powers such as ESP. The paper, written by Cornell professor Daryl J. Bem, was published in The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology and quickly made headlines around the world for its implication: that psychic powers had been scientifically proven. Bem’s claim of evidence for ESP wasn’t ridiculed or ignored; instead it was taken seriously and tested by scientific researchers. Replication is of course the hallmark of valid scientific research — if the findings are true and accurate, they should be able to be replicated by others. Otherwise the results may simply be due to normal and expected statistical variations and errors. If other experimenters cannot get the same result using the same techniques, it’s usually a sign that the original study was flawed in one or more ways. A team of researchers collaborated to accurately replicate Bem’s final experiment, and found no evidence for any psychic powers. Their results were published in the journal PLoS ONE. Bem — explicitly contradicting Carter’s suggestion that skeptics set out to discredit his work or refused to look at it — acknowledged that the findings did not support his claims and wrote that the researchers had “made a competent, good-faith effort to replicate the results of one of my experiments on precognition.” SEE ALSO: Indonesian Crop Circle Prompts Rumors of Aliens
 The following year a second group of scientists also tried to replicate Bem’s ESP experiments, and once again found no evidence for psychic power. The article, “Correcting the Past: Failures to Replicate Psi,” was published in The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology and is available on the Social Science Research Network. In September 2011, news shot around the world that Italian physicists had measured particles traveling faster than light. The neutrino in the experiment only exceeded the speed of light by a little tiny bit — 60 nanoseconds — but if validated would violate the fundamental laws of physics. Questions swirled: Would the findings hold up under repeated experiments? Could this team have proven Einstein wrong about the speed of light? What was the reaction from the scientific community to the news of this fundamentals-of-physics-challenging finding? They didn’t ignore the results, hoping the inconvenient truth would go away. They didn’t brand the scientists liars or hoaxers; they didn’t shout, “Burn the witch, this is heresy and cannot be true!” Instead, they did what all scientists do when confronted with such anomalous evidence. They took a closer look at the experiment to make sure the results were valid and tried to replicate the research. It later turned out that the anomaly was caused by at least two measurement errors, possibly including a loose cable. The experiment was flawed. The scientists were not skeptical because accepting that Einstein was wrong about something would lead to a nervous breakdown, or that their whole worldview would crumble beneath them, or that they would have to accept that science doesn’t know everything. SEE ALSO: Real-life ‘Paranormal Activity’: Are Ghosts Real?
 The reason scientists were skeptical is because the new study contradicted all previous experiments. That’s what good science does: When you do a study or experiment — especially one whose results conflict with earlier conclusions, you study it closely and question it before accepting the results. In science, those who disprove dominant theories are rewarded, not punished. Disproving one of Einstein’s best-known predictions (or proving the existence of psychic powers) would earn the dissenting scientists a place in the history books, if not a Nobel Prize. The same pattern exists in other areas of the unexplained. For example many scientists have worked on analyzing alleged hair from mysterious animals such as Bigfoot and the Chupacabra. Researchers from Oxford University spent part of last year collecting samples of alleged Bigfoot hair for possible genetic identification. Geneticist Bryan Sykes conducted DNA analysis and plans to publish his results in a peer-reviewed scientific journal soon. The reason that the scientific community doesn't accept psychic powers, Bigfoot, ghosts and other phenomena is simply because there is little or no good evidence for them — not because scientists haven’t looked at the evidence. Better research follows better evidence, and as one prominent scientist and Bigfoot researcher, British primatologist John Napier noted, “There are no shortage of problems to tackle, and it is not surprising that scientists prefer to investigate the probable rather than beat their heads against the wall of the faintly possible.” The evidence for psychic powers, like the evidence for anything else, stands or falls on its own merits. There’s no reason in the world that scientists would fear the unknown, or be afraid to learn more about the world in which we live. Image courtesy of Flickr, AlicePopkorn

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/snoox/,Snoox Helps You Discover Shopping Recommendations From Your Friends,"The Launchpad is a series that introduces Mashable readers to compelling startups. If you would like to have your startup considered for inclusion, please see the details here. Name: Snoox One-Liner Pitch: Snoox makes it easy to find and share product recommendations with the people whose opinions you value most. Why It's Taking Off: It's one of the more promising companies unlocking the power of social recommendations for shopping. There's no shortage of online reviews for shopping products; the tough part is narrowing down those recommendations to just the friends and tastemakers whose opinions you value most. That's where Snoox comes in.  Snoox, a website that launched in public beta last November, tries to make it as easy as possible for you to recommend products, and find recommendations from the people you actually care about. When you register on Snoox, the website pulls information from your Facebook account for all the items you've Liked, and then lets you decide which items you want to recommend to others.  After completing that step, Snoox prompts you to make additional recommendations using a tab at the top of the page that says, ""I recommend..."" All you have to do is type in the name of a product, write a few words that explain why you're recommending it and Snoox takes care of the back-end. The site organizes all the recommendations from your Facebook friends into a dozen categories, including books, food, music and travel; it then presents them in a very visual Pinterest-style layout.  ""Snoox is governed by recommendations between friends,"" Guy Poreh, the company's founder, tells Mashable. ""Every day, you get recommendations from friends; we are just putting that behavior on the web."" Since the site launched two months ago, more than 10,000 people have registered, and shared nearly 30,000 recommendations. Now, Snoox is putting out its first big set of updates, including speeding up the recommendation process and redesigning the homepage with a real-time feed of recommendations.   Snoox isn't the first website to tap into the power of social recommendations. Others, such as The Find and Mouthee, have previously integrated with social networks to help determine what products users and their social connections like. This space may only get more competitive in the coming months. Facebook announced a new smarter search engine called Graph Search on Tuesday that lets users search through some of this same data to find recommendations for businesses and places they may be interested in. The search feature is not specifically product-oriented yet, but it's not hard to imagine Facebook taking it in that direction in the future.  For now, the greatest obstacle for Snoox is convincing users to continue sharing recommendations. In addition to streamlining the recommendation process, Snoox also plans to release apps for iPhone and Android in the near future, as well as get celebrities on board to share recommendations of their own — all of which should help boost engagement on the service.  Snoox raised a funding round of nearly $2 million from several angel investors last year, and generates revenue from affiliate links when users purchase products through the site.

The campaign asks you to upload a photo of your smile and watch as it's sent across the world. The campaign is built around an interactive film Change Forever featuring Hawk, which asks you to share your smile through a Facebook app to help children with cleft lip or cleft palate. You're then encouraged to share your smile and the film on Facebook, Twitter or Pinterest, and to take a pledge to spread awareness of facial deformities.  The pledge also states that every child has the right to smile, because humans smile to express happiness. According to Operation Smile, a child is born every three minutes with facial deformities preventing smiling. Of those born with facial deformity, 10% will not live until their first birthday.

Anyone 13 years of age or older can register to complete a weekly survey of symptoms in effort that the shared data can help multiple sectors with pandemic preparedness. Data is made available to public health officials, researchers, disaster planning organizations and anyone else who may find this information useful. Germ Tracker culls symptom data from social media platforms and tracks the virus, via a map, as it spreads. Upon publication of this post, the site was “experiencing heavy user traffic” and politely excused any potential delays. Help, I Have the Flu, developed by pharmaceutical startup Help Remedies, is an app that scans your friends’ Facebook statuses for references to “sneezes,” “coughs” or “flu.” If someone in your network is sick, you’ll receive an alert that lets you know you might want to avoid contact with them for a few days.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/twitter-photos-permission/,Judge: News Agencies Can't Use Twitter Photos Without Permission,"In a ruling that could have dramatic consequences for online news agencies and digital journalists, a judge ruled Tuesday that two news outlets should have asked permission before using a Twitter picture from a photojournalist. According to the court's ruling, Agence France-Press violated the copyright of photojournalist Daniel Morel by taking photos of a 2010 earthquake in Haiti that he tweeted and disseminating them without permission via Getty. The Washington Post, the court found, violated Morel's copyright by running four of the photos from Getty also without Morel's permission, according to Reuters.  Twitter's Terms of Service lay at the center of District Judge Alison Nathan's decision: While the AFP argued Morel's work was free to use once posted to Twitter, Nathan instead found that Twitter's Terms of Service required that news outlets first get permission before running tweeted photos.  Nathan, however, did rule that the retweeting of such photos is allowed. Twitter has long held that photographers own their tweeted content. The company's Terms of Service section on copyright maintains that ""Twitter respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects users of the Services to do the same.""  The section also contains detailed instructions on contacting Twitter if a user feels his or her content is ""copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement."" SEE ALSO: Redditors Accuse BuzzFeed of Photo Theft
 The trial began in early 2010 when the AFP sued in order to get a judge's ruling that it was legally allowed to distribute tweeted photos after Morel first accused it of copyright infringement. Morel then launched a countersuit against the AFP, the Washington Post and Getty.  Morel initially called for ""tens or hundreds of millions of dollars,"" but the judge on Tuesday limited the financial damages Morel might be entitled to receive to a single award per infringed image. The judge also refused to rule on whether the news outlets acted willingly in violating Morel's copyright or if they violated his rights under the Digital Millenium Copyright Act. The trial is still ongoing. Getty is a party to the trial but was not included in Tuesday's decision.  Full disclosure: Mashable is a Getty subscriber.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/we-the-people-petitions/,"When We the People Talk, It's Not Always Pretty","The flood of petitions advocating secession that flowed into the White House after President Obama’s November reelection were not the most constructive use of the administration’s public engagement website We the People.  Directly engaging the public, however, is a messy business that requires dealing with a lot of loud people so a few softer voices that might not otherwise be heard can break through, digital democracy advocate J.H. Snider said Monday.   Petitioners from all 50 states sought to secede from the union in the wake of President Obama’s reelection victory. The White House responded to nine of those petitions that crossed the 25,000 signature threshold for an official reply on Friday. Snider is president of the digital democracy project iSolon.org and a fellow at Harvard University’s Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. He compared the secession petitions to the often outlandish questions politicians take on TV and radio call-in programs or at town hall meetings. “Petitions are a type of democratic research and development,” Snider said. “Like R and D investments, few petitions will pan out, and it may take many years for the payoff.  Despite the short term cost and hassles, they are worth it. They strengthen democracy.” We the People’s principal value for Snider is less about how the administration responds to petitions but that the site becomes a tool for advocates of low-visibility issues to begin rallying public support. He described the site as having great promise soon after it launched in September 2011 but said he’s been less impressed by the way it’s developed since then. He criticized the site Monday for promoting “featured responses” about issues that are administration priorities such as reducing gun violence and reforming immigration rather than issues that might not otherwise garner public attention. He also argued the White House should give petition writers access to the email addresses of signatories to use as an organizing tool. The White House has declined to do that out of privacy concerns. Harvard Professor Archon Fung agrees with Snider that We the People’s best use is to unearth issues that wouldn’t normally get a hearing on Capitol Hill. He describes the site as just as much a barometer as an organizing tool, though. “For me, it’s most interesting as an early detection system for new issues that are out there or old issues that are being treated in new ways,” he said. “I guess secession is kind of like that. People talk about states’ rights but secession is a more radical version of that for sure.” Fung’s research focuses on democracy and citizenship. Rather than simply respond to the petitions, he suggested, the White House should have reached out to some of the organizers to learn more about their concerns. The secession petitions in aggregate received more than a million individual signatures, though many people signed numerous petitions. One petition from Texas received 125,000 signatures, making it one of the most popular petitions posted to We the People thus far.   “As a matter of political preference, I don’t think secession is a reasonable policy alternative,” Fung said, “but [the secession petitions] did get a lot of signatures. That’s not many people as a percentage of the American population, but a lot relative to the site. So I would have preferred there to be some next step in the conversation.” Administration officials responded to one We the People petition on improving oversight of commercial dog breeders with a new proposed regulation. Otherwise the site has produced few major policy changes. Official White House Photo by Pete Souza

 Interestingly, the iPad mini received a lukewarm reception when it first launched in China last month. Reports suggested that turnout for Apple's 7.9-inch tablet was minimal, and that lines were ""nearly nonexistent"" — even in high-traffic areas such as the company's Beijing-based flagship store.  Still, Apple products are wildly popular in China, with more than 2 million units of the iPhone 5 sold in the first weekend it launched there.  Company CEO Tim Cook has made it clear that Apple considers the Chinese market a priority.  ""China is a very important market for us and customers there cannot wait to get their hands on Apple products,"" he said last month. The Wi-Fi and cellular-capable iPad mini and fourth-generation iPad start at $459 and $629, respectively (for the 16GB models).

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/you-cant-cry-in-space/,Why You Can't Cry in Space,"Feustel and fellow astronaut Mike Fincke had just finished running power cables from the U.S. side of the International Space Station to the Russian, and — at the EVA's five-hour mark — some anti-fogging solution from the inside of Feustel's helmet had begun to flake. One of those flakes, swirling in the modified snow globe that is a spacesuit helmet, ended up in precisely the place you wouldn't want it to. ""Just as an FYI, my right eye is stinging like crazy right now,"" the astronaut announced to his team. ""It's watering a lot. Must have gotten something in it."" Fincke's reply? ""Sorry, buddy."" Which was an appropriately mellow response, because Feustel's liquid little plight wasn't an emergency: He managed to wiggle down far enough in his spacesuit to reach the spongy device typically used to block the nose in case of a pressure readjustment — and to use that to rub his eye. Which did the trick.  But the episode was a reminder that much of the science — much of the experimentation in general — being done on the orbiting lab of the space station is being conducted, by default, on the humans who call the vehicle home. Knowledge — about zero-gravity's effect on the body, about space as a human environment — reveals itself in fits and starts, through unexpected events like the flaking of anti-fogging solution in an astronaut's helmet. In this case, Feustel's tearjerker was a reminder of the fact that astronauts, technically, can't cry. Astronauts can, certainly, tear up — they're human, after all. But in zero gravity, the tears themselves can't flow downward in the way they do on Earth. The moisture generated has nowhere to go. Tears, Feustel put it, ""don't fall off of your eye ... they kind of stay there."" NASA spacewalk officer Allison Bollinger, who oversaw Feustel's EVA, confirmed this assessment. ""They actually kind of conglomerate around your eyeball,"" she said. In other words, yep: There's no crying in space. And now, courtesy of ISS Expedition 34, we know a little bit more about the brand-new phenomenon that is tears in heavens: Crying, without the crying part, actually kind of hurts. And that's so even when the tears in question aren't being formed by eye-stingingly errant chemical flakes. Chris Hadfield, current ISS denizen and prolific tweeter, replied to a student question on the subject with this description of space tears: @dkiazyk Can you cry in space? Your eyes make tears but they stick as a liquid ball. In fact, they sting a bit. So - space tears don't shed. — Chris Hadfield (@Cmdr_Hadfield) January 8, 2013 Which is ... weird. Tears, in theory, shouldn't hurt. We don't know why, exactly, we cry, but we're pretty sure that the action, evolutionarily, has a palliative effect. Tears should soothe, not sting. But we know as well that life in near-zero-gravity can have a deleterious effect on human vision — and one explanation for that could be fluids shifting toward the head during long-term stays in microgravity. It could be that space gives you a pretty wretched case of dry eye — and that sudden moisture to the cornea, particularly when it takes the form of (eeesh) ""a liquid ball,"" could sting rather than soothe. Then again — fortunately for any sob-happy space explorers currently above us — those eyeball-clinging orbs are easily dealt with. If you experience them in the space station itself, you can just wipe them away. Or, if you can put up with the stinging, you can wait for them to blow you away. According to shuttle astronaut Ron Parise, ""When the tears get big enough they simply break free of the eye and float around."" Meaning that, in space, you could ostensibly watch a show composed of your own weightless tears. Which sounds just beautiful and lyrical and haunting enough to make you want to ... well, you know.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/zamboni-google-doodle/,Latest Google Doodle Is an Interactive Zamboni Driving Game,"The NHL finally returns this weekend, and while you may not be able to skate with your favorite hockey stars, you can drive the Zamboni.  Well, let's qualify that: You can drive a digital Zamboni thanks to the latest Google Doodle, which recently went live in Australia.  When you hit play, skaters and hockey players mark up a patch of ice with their blades. Then you enter with your Zamboni and use your arrow keys to motor around and smooth out the surface while picking up fuel cans for extra range and ice cream cones for bonus points.  It's a pretty slick little game and calls to mind the interactive Doodles Google released during the 2012 Summer Olympics.  But why the Zamboni theme? It's not the salvaged NHL season we have to thank — Jan. 16 is the 112th birthday of Frank Zamboni, Jr., inventor of the much-loved ice resurfacer. Frank, who passed away in 1988, was an innovator and entrepreneur in his own right well before the days of digital. According to the Zamboni Company website, he and his brother left the refrigeration business to open an ice rink in Paramount, Calif., in 1940. When they found the process of manually resurfacing their rink to be arduous and inefficient, Frank began experimenting and the first Zamboni model was finalized in 1949.  The company is still based in Paramount and has produced more than 10,000 machines since. To have some fun with the new Zamboni Google Doodle, head over to Google.com.au, or simply wait a few hours for Jan. 16 to roll around where you are — then go to Google.com.

But the most head-turning feature may be the dashboard's retracting LCD screen. At the touch of a button, the screen in the middle of the dash lowers, revealing a ""secret"" alcove where the driver or passenger can stash a cellphone, camera or anything about the size of a baseball or smaller. There's even a USB port for charging and syncing your phone while it's safely ensconced in the cubby. Besides being übercool, the hidden space has a clandestine aspect — hard for anyone to steal objects within if they don't even know it's there. Not that we'd ever recommend hiding contraband inside it. SEE ALSO: Chevy Unveils 2014 Corvette at Detroit Auto Show

The new Corvette features a top-to-bottom redesign of the iconic sports car. Now built out of aluminum and carbon fiber instead of steel, it's lighter and has more horsepower -- 450 to the 2013 model's 430. No price yet, but Chevy says it'll be in the neighborhood of current Corvettes with start around $50,000. The 2014 Corvette has a new logo as well. One of the more controversial aspects of the redesign is the back end, which ditches the circular tail lights that have been around since the first Corvette in 1953 for something more modern. The Stingray logo, not used since the 1970s, also got a makeover. The 2014 Corvette dashboard includes two HD screens, one of which retracts at the touch of a buttton. The interior design got a makeover, too, with ""adrenaline red"" seat coloring as an option. The Corvette has been redesigned only six times, for a grand total of seven generations of the car, including the 2014 model. This is the one that started it all. Photos by Pete Pachal, Mashable "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/aaron-swartz-law-lofgren/,'Aaron's Law' Proposed on Reddit in Honor of Aaron Swartz,"The law that was used to prosecute Internet freedom activist and hacker Aaron Swartz could be amended in the near future —  at least that's what Democratic California Rep. Zoe Lofgren wants.  Lofgren posted on Reddit Tuesday evening a proposal to amend the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, under which Swartz was being charged.  ""We should prevent what happened to Aaron from happening to other Internet users,"" Lofgren wrote on her Reddit post.  Lofgren called her proposal ""Aaron's Law."" The core of Lofgren's proposal is to make the violation of an online service’s user agreement (commonly referred to as ""terms of service"") a non-criminal activity. She underscored the importance of reforming a law that dates back to 1986 and one that's being harshly critiqued. ""The government was able to bring such disproportionate charges against Aaron because of the broad scope of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and the wire fraud statute,"" wrote Lofgren. ""It looks like the government used the vague wording of those laws to claim that violating an online service’s user agreement or terms of service is a violation of the CFAA and the wire fraud statute."" After Swartz's death on Friday, his friends and supporters pointed fingers at what some consider his prosecutor's overzealous behavior. Lawyer and prominent Internet thinker Lawrence Lessig likened the prosecution to ""bullying."" Swartz was facing a maximum of 35 years in prison and up to $1 million in fines.  Marcia Hoffmann, a senior staff attorney for the digital rights advocacy group the Electronic Frontier Foundation, criticized the CFFA in a post published on Monday. The key to Swartz's case, according to Hoffmann, was that the prosecution was accusing him of gaining unauthorized access to MIT's network to download scholarly articles. The CFAA makes it a felony to access a computer network ""without authorization"" or in a manner that ""exceeds authorized access."" ""Unfortunately, the law doesn't clearly explain what a lack of 'authorization' actually means,"" Hoffmann wrote in the post. ""Creative prosecutors have taken advantage of this confusion to craft criminal charges that aren't really about hacking a computer but instead target other behavior the prosecutors don't like."" SEE ALSO: Is it Time to Reform the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act?
 But Lofgren's proposal might not be enough to solve this issue. ""It’s a great first step,” Hoffman told Forbes. ""But if it’s trying to make sure what happened to Aaron can’t happen to someone else, it needs to do more."" Tor Ekeland, a lawyer who has worked in the recent case of a hacker who published the email addresses of 114,000 iPad users, which AT&T left visible on a public website, agrees that an eventual reform to the CFAA needs to tackle this issue.  ""Unauthorized access is nowhere defined in the [CFAA] and the case law is hopelessly confused on this point,"" he wrote in Forbes. ""The [CFAA] is a prosecutor’s wet dream and a defendant’s nightmare. Amending the definition of unauthorized access to exclude [terms of service] violations is just putting a band aid on a gaping, gushing wound."" Lofgren's draft hasn't been introduced to the house yet — she posted it on Reddit to receive feedback and suggestions from the online community. So there's a possibility that her actual proposal will address these issues. ""Lofgren’s bill is a good start,"" Lessig told TIME.  Photo by Wendy Maeda/The Boston Globe via Getty Images "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/actuv-robot-submarine/,Futuristic Robot Ship Tracks Enemy Submarines,"







 A U.S. robot ship resembling a Star Wars spacecraft skimming the waves could hunt for enemy submarines within a few years. The unarmed robot ship, called Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV), aims to track submarines using laser detectors, radar and sonar. Such steady sea surveillance could protect the U.S. Navy's prize aircraft carriers and other large warships against underwater threats — one of many ways robots can watch the backs of humans on future battlefields. ACTUV's design has a ""trimaran"" shape with gull-like ""wings"" touching the water on either side of the ship's main body, so that it could appear to almost fly over the ocean surface at high speeds. A video released in December 2012 envisions how the robot ship could handle its future tracking missions. A human pilot could operate the ship remotely until it gets out of harbor, but ACTUV's own robotic brains would take over from there as it patrolled and tracked down submarines. SEE ALSO: Military's Future Robot Ship Hunts Submarines
 Sea deployments would ideally last from 60 to 90 days without any humans or maintenance. ACTUV could supposedly survive rough wind and waves approaching near-gale conditions of 32 to 38 mph. The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) awarded $58 million to the Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) in August 2012 — funding intended for building and testing the ACTUV robot ship. DARPA wants the robot ship to begin sea trials by mid-2015. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Carnegie Mellon University both have a hand in helping create the robot's software brains. SAIC has also enlisted the help of Oregon Iron Works and Christensen Shipyards to work on ship design, construction and propulsion. Such a robotic submarine hunter would represent one of many tireless robots working for the U.S. Navy in the near future. The Navy previously experimented with ways to launch drones from its own submarines and test-fired missiles from robot boats. U.S. Navy warships are also poised to deploy swarms of drone helicopters and warplanes from their decks. The Navy has tried out drone helicopters such as the MQ-8 Fire Scout during operations targeting smugglers and pirates from the air. More recently, the X-47 robot warplane the size of a fighter jet underwent its first sea trials aboard a U.S. aircraft carrier in late 2012. Defense experts have even envisioned the Navy deploying a huge submarine to act as an underwater mothership for swarms of swimming or flying robots. That scenario came up during war games held by the U.S. Department of Defense's NeXTech workshop series in August 2012.

A recent Pew research report found eight in 10 online health inquiries start at a search engine. But what if you need more info or want to have a medical consult?  GreatCall, makers of the Jitterbug phone, has introduced the Urgent Care  app.  It lets you search symptoms, peruse a medical dictionary and basically be your own doctor. Unless, of course, you feel you need one.  In that case you simply press a button and you'll be connected to a live registered nurse who, after asking a few questions, can help diagnose your issues. If more care is needed, the nurse can connect you to a  board-certified doctor in your area who will call you within 30 minutes.   This isn't for emergencies or for when you think you may need to go to the hospital. We don't recommend waiting 30 minutes to find out you should head to the emergency room. Instead Urgent Care is a useful resource in situations where you may have a question about medication or are unsure if something is serious and should be escalated. I can also see Urgent Care being particularly useful for seniors who live alone and want the reassurance of a registered nurse in the middle of the night. The staff is all US-based and available 24/7. Looking up information is free, but each call to a nurse costs $3.99.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/att-facetime-cellular/,AT&T Allows More FaceTime — Except for Unlimited Customers,"AT&T is allowing more iOS users to place FaceTime calls over its network for no additional charge. Previously only available for customers with Mobile Share plans and those using an LTE device on a tiered plan, now AT&T customers with non-LTE tiered plans can also make FaceTime calls over AT&T’s network for no additional charge. AT&T customers on unlimited data plans are still unable to make FaceTime calls over the network.  FaceTime over cellular originally launched on AT&T in September 2012.  AT&T’s Mark Collins says that the company wanted to roll the service out gradually, in order to have “minimal impact on the mobile experience for all of our customers.” Last September several public interest groups, including Free Press, Public Knowledge and New America Foundation’s Open Technology Institute, placed a formal complaint against the carrier with the FCC over its decision to block the service on all but its most expensive data plans. Wednesday, Matt Wood, policy director at Free Press, issued a statement on the issue in light of AT&T's support for additional data plans.  ""AT&T's announcement is another step in the right direction. It shows once again that the FCC's Open Internet rules can create more consumer certainty, as they work to give people more choices and freedom in use of their data. Yet as we've made clear all along, the company has no right to block the application in the first place. Until AT&T makes FaceTime available to all of its customers, it is still in violation of the law and the broader principles of Net Neutrality. We remain ready to bring our complaint unless AT&T finishes the job and stops blocking this application altogether."" The carrier has started updating its systems and processes, and expects to start rolling the update out to customers gradually over the next few weeks. The update will arrive automatically for affected AT&T customers. Thumbnail image courtesy of Apple "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/australian-open-social/,The Australian Open's Smashing Social Presence,"Tennis fans around the world are focused Down Under for the Australian Open Grand Slam tournament that started on Monday, and runs through Jan. 27.  But you don't have to be in Melbourne or glued to your TV to follow the action, thanks to the tournament's outstanding digital presence that builds on last year's social smash hit.  Like last year, a social leader board ranks the top male and female players at the tournament according to who is gaining the most social mentions and driving the most traffic on the Australian Open site. Also returning are the 24/7 live updates from the tournament through its official Facebook and Twitter pages.  But some new initiatives have beefed up the digital offerings as well.  A Twitter account called @AOSOS has been set up to act as a help hotline for out-of-towners visiting for the tournament — somewhat similar to the social-media command center for last year's Super Bowl.  ""Having this account allows us to carve out these questions from the main tournament account, and provide a customer service-based interaction with fans,"" says Daniel Lattimer, social-media coordinator for Tennis Australia, the sport's governing body Down Under. A free iPad app called Open Shutter, meanwhile, delivers a day-by-day photographic timeline of the tournament, while the the official Australian Open program will be available for iPad as well as in hard copy. There's an added emphasis placed on Pinterest, Instagram and Google+, as well. While last year's Open was a digital success, and this year features an even more robust social offering, you can expect next year's tournament to keep adding new angles.  ""We're constantly looking at ways to enhance the fan experience across a variety of social media and digital channels, and offer them unique experiences,"" Lattimer says.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/baxter-the-robot-factories/,Could Baxter the Robot Save Our Small Factories?,"Chris Budnick is head of Vanguard Plastics, a small injection-molding operation in Southington, Conn., that makes plastic fixtures, gaskets and other “stuff no one cares about unless it breaks.” On a computer screen, placed where all his workers can see it, Budnick displays what he considers the company’s key statistic: sales divided by man-hours. Budnick, a Yankees fan who never misses a game on the radio, calls it his company’s “batting average.” Wages are his second-biggest expense (after raw materials), and sales have been slow. Even so, the figure stands at $206.8 per man-hour, above the previous year’s mark of 201. For Vanguard to stay in business, says Budnick, the figure has to go up by 1% or more every year. There’s only one way get there: produce more while working less. That is why Budnick is now considering adding a new member to his team: a robot called Baxter. Baxter was conceived by Rodney Brooks, the Australian roboticist and artificial-intelligence expert who left MIT to build a $22,000 humanoid robot that can easily be programmed to do simple jobs that have never been automated before. Brooks’s company, Rethink Robotics, says the robot will spark a “renaissance” in American manufacturing by helping small companies compete against low-wage offshore labor. Baxter will do that by accelerating a trend of factory efficiency that’s eliminated more jobs in the U.S. than overseas competition has. Of the approximately 5.8 million manufacturing jobs the U.S. lost between 2000 and 2010, according to McKinsey Global Institute, two-thirds were lost because of higher productivity and only 20% moved to places like China, Mexico or Thailand. At Budnick’s shop, it’s easy to see how efficient things already are. Even though it’s a small company, with $6 million in revenue, Vanguard operates state-of-the-art automated electric presses, costing about $150,000 each, that crush plastic pellets into shapes under 1,000 atmospheres of pressure. Custom-built robots—running on tracks overhead—swing down to pluck out the finished parts and place them on a conveyor. The presses work nonstop from Monday to Saturday at noon. Sunday is for resting. One routine job that’s still done by hand at Vanguard is packing parts. Coming off one of the presses are small, textured, plastic cups, which Vanguard sells for $0.02 apiece to a medical company to package liquid medicines. A worker from a temporary agency, earning $9 an hour, stacks the cups, then flicks a plastic bag over the stacks. This is the job that Baxter will be trying out for when Rethink delivers a modified version of the robot, due at Vanguard for a field test this winter. Budnick says if he can eliminate one temporary worker—thus earning back his investment in a single year—he’ll buy Rethink’s robot. “This will be a big test for them,” says Budnick, pointing to the tattooed worker stacking the cups. “Because if they can’t do that, what can they do?”  Rethink, which unveiled Baxter to wide attention in the media last September, hasn’t sold any robots yet. But it has received inquiries from scores of manufacturers, including artisanal breweries that want to see if the robot can box bottles. “Most folks are treating it as a totally new category that they should roll out in small numbers,” says Mitch Rosenberg, vice president of marketing at Rethink, which has raised more than $62 million from investors. The ultimate goal is for robots like Baxter to take over more complex tasks, such as fitting together parts on an electronics assembly line. “A couple more ticks of Moore’s Law and you’ve got automation that works more cheaply than Chinese labor does,” Andrew McAfee, an MIT researcher, predicted last year at a conference in Tucson, Ariz., where Baxter was discussed. Rethink brags that its robot is made of 75% American parts and is built in Massachusetts. The flag-waving is intentional: its target market is people like Budnick, 48, a Little League coach and former Army lieutenant who has resisted overtures to move his factory to Mexico and refuses to buy machine molds from mainland China because “they are not free people. They don’t vote.” But Budnick won’t buy Baxter out of patriotism. When Rethink executives first brought the robot to Vanguard for a demonstration early in 2012, he and his father thought Baxter looked like a relative weakling compared with their imported Austrian presses, some of which have been operating for 100,000 hours. “They came in and said, ‘Well Mr. B, what do you think of that?’ And my dad said, ‘Well, you know, you guys have to improve it 100%,’ ” says Budnick. “And all the engineers’ jaws dropped.”  Baxter comes with two arms, a vision system, and 360-degree sonar (which it uses to detect people nearby), but for the cup-stacking job it will also need a specially designed gripper, which Rethink is now developing. Rethink is also developing software so that the robot can communicate with other machines, such as a conveyor belt, telling it to move forward or stop. So how important will Baxter really be to Vanguard? Budnick couches his answer in baseball terminology. “Baxter is a potential double,” he says. “Maybe a home run if it can use both its arms.”  Photo courtesy of Flickr, jurvetson

http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/beijing-pollution-pittsburgh/,Aghast Over Beijing's Pollution? Look at Pittsburgh 60 Years Ago,"The photographs and measurements coming out of Beijing these days are horrifying. You can see the brown clouds from space, and Chinese media have even been talking up the problem. I've heard from some Americans saying, ""Why don't they do something about this? How can they live like this?"" Etcetera. To an early 21st century American, particularly one living in northern California or a relatively pollution-free Washington, DC, it seems crazy to live with such bad air. But it was not always so. As America became an industrial power during the 19th century, Pittsburgh emerged as the seat of metalworking, iron and then steel. This was a city powered by coal. Soot and smoke covered the city. There was no blue sky. Travelers from around the world visited Pittsburgh to see the wonder of American capitalism. The stories they tell are like — exactly, like — the ones you hear today about China. (This is a story that I covered in some detail in my book.) A wry southerner observed, ""If a sheet of white paper lie upon your desk for half an hour you may write on it with your finger's end through the thin stratum of coal dust that has settled upon it during that interval.""  Another traveler recounted, ""Every body who has heard of Pittsburgh knows that it is the city of perpetual smoke, and looks as if it were built above the descent to 'the bottomless pit,'"" that is to say, hell. And yet, this dirty power also happened to make a lot of people a lot of money. It was said, ""He whose hands are the most sooty handles the most money, and it is reasonable to infer is the richer man."" Everyone knew that the smoke covering their homes and clothes and trees was bad. But it made a certain group of people a lot of money. And so they fought pollution controls. And those people had friends. So, while the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (granted, a less august institution back then) declared the health hazards of smoke and wondered aloud whether corporations should be allowed to produce what it called such ""evil,"" a Pittsburgh doctor maintained that soot and smoke ""only go throat-deep"" and said that fire and smoke ""correct atmospheric impurities."" The politics of how this works are pretty simple. The smoke and the soot are something we recognize now as an externality. A cost of doing business that the business doesn't have to pay because they can dump it on society. Chinese citizens and activists and assorted air-breathers will have to get the polluting companies to internalize these costs. The polluting companies don't want to internalize that cost. Here's Chicago's smoke inspector (yes htere was such a title and in this case, he was named F.U. Adams) in 1896 laying out the rhetorical positions of the two camps: Viewed from the standpoint of the Smoke Inspector, the 1,600,000 people of Chicago are divided into two classes—First, those who create a smoke nuisance; Second, those who are compelled to tolerate a smoke nuisance. One class has radical champions who maintain that smoke is an irrepressible necessity; a concomitant of the commercial and manufacturing supremacy of Chicago; that smoke not only is not unhealthy, but that it is an actual disinfectant, and that the low death rate of the city can be largely attributed to the prevalence of smoke; that the smoke ordinance and its enforcement are aimed at the interests of the Illinois coal operators; that the advocates of smoke abatement are visionary sentimentalists, and in a general way they are emphatically opposed to any agitation on the subject. The other side has partisans no less radical, and equally emphatic in voicing the story of their wrongs. They declare that the enforcement of the smoke ordinance is a farce; they demand that soft coal be excluded from the city; they insist that its consumption entails an annual damage greater than the difference in cost between soft and hard coal; they declare that the smoke nuisance is a positive menace to the health of citizens, that it has resulted in an alarming increase in throat, lung and eye diseases; they point to ruined carpets, paintings, fabrics, the soot-besmeared facades of buildings and to a smoke-beclouded sky, and demand that the Smoke Inspector do his plain duty under the law. It is impossible to reconcile the radical partisans of these two classes. It is fortunate that not many of our citizens are so radical on either side of this most important question. There exists a growing contingent, around which is crystallizing a sentiment that it is practical and possible to abate the smoke nuisance without endangering the stupendous interests involved. The most intelligent and active members of this contingent are drawn from the ranks of those formerly largely responsible for the smoke nuisance. They now oppose smoke for the same reason that they once defended it. They have made the discovery that it is cheaper to abate a smoke nuisance than to maintain one. And by reason of this discovery the smoke nuisance in Chicago will be a relic of the past before the close of the present century.
 Ah, you beautiful visionary sentimentalists! My asthma thanks you. But man, F.U. Adams was optimistic. Change takes a long time. Pittsburgh, for its part, did not enact smoke controls until 1946! Yes, 1946! And they didn't really get a handle on the smoke problem until well into the 1950s. That's, oh, 120 years after all those travelers decried the place as hell with the lid off. I mean, this is what Pittsburgh looked like at noon, the lights all on because so little sunlight could penetrate the pollution:  This is what passed for fresh air.  Until finally, one day, after a century of agitation, activists got smoke control measures passed. The sky started to clear.  The fundamental struggle of any kind of pollution control is trying to get the polluters to internalize the costs of their pollution. Because if they don't, the rest of us have to pay more. We — i.e. all of society — subsidize their businesses through increased health care costs, declining values of certain kinds of housing, toxic land or water or air. And the only reason they get away with it is that tracing the line of causality back to them — even when the air looks as disgusting as it does in these photographs — is just that difficult. They hide their roles in the complexity of the system. So, next time you see one of the photos of Beijing's pollution and say, ""Geez! The Chinese should do something about this!"" Just know that it took American activists over a century to win the precise same battle, and that they're losing a similar one over climate change right this minute. Image courtesy of NASA

http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/bizarre-white-house-petitions/,The 10 Most Bizarre White House Petitions,"In 1791, the United States of America, in the text of the First Amendment, promised its citizens that Congress shall never have the authority to prohibit or abridge their right ""to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."" In 2012, one concerned citizen exercised that right by requesting the U.S. government build a Death Star, the Empire's focal point in the original Star Wars trilogy. The petition gained the 25,000 signatures necessary to force a response from the White House, an act that fully lived up to its comedic potential. (""The Administration does not support blowing up planets,"" reads one part of the response.)  But that's just one of countless documents making a public mockery of We the People, the White House's official petition site, started in 2011 to use the Internet to foster participation and transparency in the Obama administration. Hundreds of petitions have been submitted to the site, with more than 250 currently remaining open. Most of them are serious in nature, demanding that the government take constitutional stances on issues such as gun control, Internet rights, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, the latter created by hacktivist collective Anonymous. But regrettably, it's the more absurd protests that have garnered the public's attention and support. Here are a few of the most bizarre requests made thus far. And appreciate them while you can, because the White House is no longer amused. Signatures: 37,167 As the White House's project grew in popularity, many petitioners felt that their voices were simply not being heard — whether the threshold of 25,000 signatures was met or not. In what could be possibly be the site's most meta moment so far, there was a petition for petitions to be taken more seriously. ""You are not above us. You ARE us. Govern accordingly,"" the petition concluded. Response: In an essay titled ""We're Listening. Seriously,"" the White House explored the process behind the site's operation, making sure to clarify any gray areas. ""We may not agree with the policy views expressed in every petition (for example, we believe we do take these petitions seriously!), and gathering enough signatures to meet the signature threshold does not guarantee that the Administration will change our policy on a specific topic,"" read a part of the response. Signatures: 109,334 In response to Morgan's ""hostile attack against the U.S. Constitution by targeting the Second Amendment,"" angry citizens called for the deportation of the British journalist. A counter petition was created in response to this petition by users of social news site Reddit, entitled ""Keep Piers Morgan in the USA.,"" which stated that the UK didn't want him back. Response: The White House refused to send Morgan packing, citing the protection of free speech, which is also guaranteed in the First Amendment. Signatures: 6,292 Not long after 4chan's Death Star petition was released, the website BuildTheEnterprise.org petitioned to  make part of Star Trek a reality. The creator explained the various benefits that construction of the first USS Enterprise would provide, such as serving as ""a spaceship, space station and space port all in one."" How economical! Signatures: 12,240 When major media outlets reported Obama's enjoyment of a home-brewed beer named ""Honey Ale,"" it piqued the curiosity of Americans, resulting in Freedom of Information Act requests for the recipe for the beer. Despite not reaching the critical mass necessary to force a response, the Obama administration released the recipe in September 2012 to appease the all-important homebrewer voting bloc in an election year. Signatures: N/A  The 50 United States have state flags, birds and flowers. Why not official State Pokemon? The document that could have paved the way to see Pikachu represent the State of New York reached close to 1,000 signatures in one day. Unfortunately, site moderators removed it, citing an undisclosed terms-of-service violation. Signatures: 10,188 The petition that could have solved the United States' money troubles ""in two quick and simple steps"" came just days after the country avoided plunging off the so-called fiscal cliff at the end of 2012. The petition acknowledges its absurdity, but backs it up with the fact that a platinum trillion-dollar coin is ""no more absurd than playing political football with the U.S. — and global — economy at stake."" Signatures: 2,913 This single-word petition was also created just after the country's near drop off of the fiscal cliff. The petition claims that the administration has failed to understand the real causes of the country's major problems, such as gun control and global warming. ""By any reasonable definition of the American people, this administration is a failure,"" it concludes. Signatures: 1,171 An example of protest by parody, this mock petition was drafted as a response to a proposed ban on assault weapons by Senators Dianne Feinstein and Joe Lieberman. It aimed to highlight the dangers of baseball bats and hammers, stating that the two items caused more deaths in the U.S. than guns. Signatures: 2,191 Vice President Joe Biden's series of poorly worded quips and accidental utterances would make for quality reality TV. This petition wants to see a ""recurring C-SPAN television program featuring the daily activities and interactions of the Vice President with elected officials, foreign dignitaries and everyday American families."" It claims that not only will viewers see ""a glimpse of the lighthearted side of politics even in the midst of contentious and divisive national debates,"" but it will also be educated on the duties and responsibilities of the vice president. Signatures: 486 Why should being named to the position of Treasury Secretary come at the cost of one's unique signature? This petition shows that a loop-filled John Hancock and high-ranking government positions can indeed go hand-in-hand. It demands to see newly appointed Treasury Secretary Jack Lew's ""doodle on every dollar in circulation."" Photo courtesy the White House, by Pete Souza

http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/blockbuster-uk-bankruptcy/,Blockbuster UK Declares Bankruptcy,"In the latest casualty of consumers' move towards online streaming video, Blockbuster UK has entered administration, the British equivalent of bankruptcy. The chain, which employs 4,350 people in 239 stores, has called in accounting firm Deloitte, which will handle the bankruptcy proceedings. Deloitte is also handling the administration proceedings for HMV, another entertainment retailer.  Lee Manning, a partner at Deloitte, told SkyNews that, ""In recent years Blockbuster has faced increased competition from internet-based providers along with the shift to digital streaming of movies and games. We are working closely with suppliers and employees to ensure the business has the best possible platform to secure a sale, preserve jobs and generate as much value as possible for all creditors.""   The move follows Blockbuster U.S.'s bankruptcy filing in 2010. Dish Network bought Blockbuster in 2011. Blockbuster UK launched in 1989 and is independent of the U.S. operation. Though the impetus for Blockbuster's downfall was competition from Netflix, Blockbuster proved itself too slow to effectively respond. The company launched its DVD-by-mail service in 2004, seven years after Netflix's launch. Blockbuster's Dish-based streaming video service, which was hyped to be a response to Netflix's streaming video service, was actually just a $10 a month add-on for existing Dish subscribers.  Because of the streaming revolution, DVD sales in the U.S. fell 120% in units in 2012, according to Digital Entertainment Group. Blu-ray sales, however, propped up revenues, which only fell 2%.

In fact, according to a study, one in four teens respond to texts at their wheels, and 30 percent read messages while on the road. A new app hopes to change that by giving parents a tool to track their children while they are in their cars. The app is called Canary and allows parents to track a teenager's phone, letting them see when they make calls, text or even leave a certain area in real time. It also notifies when the app is disabled.  ""Parents get immediate alerts via the app installed on their own phones and by email, with complete details of their teens’ activities,"" states the app description. Basically, the app will let you track your kids and instantly notify you whenever they use their phone while driving. SEE ALSO: 5 Apps To Prevent Your Teen From Texting While Driving

http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/e-books-vs-print/,Why Printed Books Will Never Die,"Measured en masse, the stack of ""books I want to read"" that sits precariously on the edge of a built-in bookshelf in my dining room just about eclipses 5,000 pages. The shelf is full to bursting with titles I hope to consume at some indeterminate point in the future.  It would be a lot easier to manage if I just downloaded all those books to an iPad or Kindle. None are hard to find editions that would be unavailable in a digital format, and a few are recent hardcover releases, heavy and unwieldy.  But there's something about print that I can't give up. There's something about holding a book in your hand and the visceral act of physically turning a page that, for me at least, can't be matched with pixels on a screen. Yet the writing appears to be on the wall: E-books are slowly subsuming the printed format as the preferred vehicle on which people read books. E-books topped print sales for the first time in 2011, a trend that continued into 2012. Just this month, Bexar County, Texas announced plans for the nation's first electronic-only library.  A recent study from Scholastic found that the percentage of children who have read an e-book has nearly doubled since 2010 to almost half of all kids aged 9 to 17, while the number who say they'll continue to read books in print instead of electronically declined from 66% to 58%.   The hits keep coming. For those who prefer their books printed in ink on paper, that sounds depressing. But perhaps there is reason to hope that e-books and print books could have a bright future together, because for all the great things e-books accomplish — convenience, selection, portability, multimedia — there are still some fundamental qualities they will simply never possess.  That's not to say that electronic books can't be beautiful — as a medium, e-books are still new and designers have yet to fully realize their potential.  But for paper books, we're already there.  As Craig Mod points out in his essay ""Hacking the Cover,"" the book cover evolved as a marketing tool.  It had to grab your attention from its place on the shelf.  For that reason, the best designed covers were often beautiful art pieces.  Not so in the digital world. ""The cover image may help quickly ground us, but our eyes are drawn by habit to number and quality of reviews. We’re looking for metrics other than images — real metrics — not artificial marketing signifiers,"" he wrote. And though that might eventually free book designers to get more creative with their designs, you can't display a digital book, even if you wanted to.  Any electronic book that boasts beautiful design, does so only ethereally. Author Joe Queenan, in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, argued that e-books are great for people who care only about the contents, have vision problems or other physical limitations or who are ashamed of what they're reading.   But for people who truly love books, print is the only medium that will satisfy.   ""People who need to possess the physical copy of a book, not merely an electronic version, believe that the objects themselves are sacred,"" he wrote.  ""Some people may find this attitude baffling, arguing that books are merely objects that take up space. This is true, but so are Prague and your kids and the Sistine Chapel."" Web entrepreneur, designer and novelist Jack Cheng, who recently funded the printing of his book through Kickstarter, told me that printed books just offer a more robust experience to the reader.  ""I feel like with e-books, you often just get a meal on the same white plate as all the other meals,"" he mused. ""But a nice hardcover is like having a place setting, having dinnerware selected to suit the food. The story is still the main thing you're there for, but the choices around it — the paper stock, the way the book is typeset, the selection of fonts — they add their own subtle flavors to the experience of that story.""  Your favorite books define you, and digital versions don't seem to impart connections that are quite as deep.   Queenan again:  Books as physical objects matter to me, because they evoke the past. A Métro ticket falls out of a book I bought 40 years ago, and I am transported back to the Rue Saint-Jacques on Sept. 12, 1972, where I am waiting for someone named Annie LeCombe. A telephone message from a friend who died too young falls out of a book, and I find myself back in the Chateau Marmont on a balmy September day in 1995. A note I scribbled to myself in ""Homage to Catalonia"" in 1973 when I was in Granada reminds me to learn Spanish, which I have not yet done, and to go back to Granada. This piece of the experience doesn't translate to the electronic format.  Someday in the distant future, maybe David Eggers' Kindle will be sold by Bauman Rare Books on Madison Avenue, but it's unlikely that digital books will ever be personal artifacts the way that their physical counterparts can be.   ""I think print and paper has a lasting value that people appreciate. Pixels are too temporary,"" said Praveen Madan, an entrepreneur on the Kepler's 2020 team, via email. Madan and his cohorts are attempting to reinvent the business model for independent bookstores, including ways to sell and offer services around e-books. ""Books have been around for a very long time and people have a deeper relationship with some books than most digital content,"" he said.  They possess the quality of scarcity, which means that your copy is unique on some level. For readers who truly love a particular book, an electronic facsimile is not an adequate replacement for owning a physical copy.   ""There are books that I need bound and sitting on my shelf. I need a copy of Fahrenheit 451. That book is important to me,"" author Rob Hart, the website administrator for digital imprint Mysterious Press and class director at LitReactor, told me. ""Digital technology is funny — you own an e-book, but you don't ... You're paying for the right to access data."" Cheng has also felt the draw of books as collectible objects. ""Personally I've gone out and purchased hardcovers of books I first read on my Kindle because I wanted them in a more tangible form,"" he explained. ""Having a hardcover on my shelf is like having a print by one of my favorite artists on the wall."" He predicts that print might have a future similar to vinyl. ""The physical artifacts are beginning to feel more precious, more like gifts. And I can see publishing going the same way,"" he said. ""Maybe what we'll lose to digital publishing are the cheaply produced mass market printings on poor quality paper. And what we'll gain is a new appreciation for well-designed, higher-quality hardbacks, like the ones folks at The Folio Society are putting out."" In a surprising flip of the traditional publishing cycle, Random House's Doubleday recently announced plans to print hardcover versions of E.L. James' bestselling 50 Shades of Grey trilogy, even though electronic and mass market paperback editions have already sold 65 million copies. Why? Reader demand. You just can't collect an e-book.
 
  The PBS website MediaShift recently asked a group of book lovers in Chapel Hill and Durham, N.C. which they preferred: printed or electronic books?  Those who preferred printed books cited things like the smell, the feel and the weight as reasons.   ""Paper books don't get replaced by e-books, because there's just part of the experience you can't reproduce,"" said one man. (Of course, nostalgia is generational.) But if e-books just replace mass market paperbacks, as Cheng predicts, will books become merely art pieces? Some pundits think so.  Writing last year in Slate, Michael Agresta argued that printed books will only survive as art.  Books are no longer a good ""vessel for text,"" he wrote. ""Bookshelves will survive in the homes of serious digital-age readers, but their contents will be much more judiciously curated. The next generation of paper books will likely rival the art hanging beside them on the walls for beauty, expense, and 'aura' — for better or for worse."" In some ways, Agresta is correct. It would be smart to bet that print sales will continue to decline, while e-book sales will continue to rise. Most people will own fewer printed books, and those they do own may very well be beautiful collector's editions, like the 50 Shades hardcovers, meant for display.   But it's a mistake to assume that this is a case of the MP3 replacing the CD, or the CD replacing the cassette.  E-books are not simply a better format replacing an inferior one; they offer a wholly different experience. Brian Haberlin is one of the co-authors of Anomaly, an ambitious printed graphic novel, augmented by a smartphone app that makes animations leap off the page while you read. I asked why he chose to print the heavy, unwieldy and expensive hardcover edition. His answer was simple: ""Because books are cool!  I love print, always will. I love digital, always will. But they will continue to be different experiences. It’s a different texture, a different experience and that alone warrants their existence."" Yes, Anomaly is one of those beautiful, collectible art pieces. But it also highlights why print is here to stay. The experience of reading Anomaly on your iPad is vastly different than the experience of reading the printed version. The story is the same, but the medium affects the way you read it.  It's not totally unlike the difference between watching the movie version of Les Miserables and watching it performed live on stage.  There may come a time when we look at electronic books and printed books as similarly divergent mediums. In a recent Fast Company column titled ""The Future of Reading,"" author and comedian Baratunde Thurston made a compelling case for why books might just be better in electronic form.  Superior annotation tools, easier discovery, interactive content and shared reading experiences are just some of the things made possible because digital publishing has allowed us to, as Thurston put it, network our words ""and the ideas they represent.""  For Thurston, this is an either-or scenario.  Digital books or printed books.  And while he lamented our diminished attention spans — the result of distractions embedded in the digital format — he concluded that it's all worth it because of the great things e-books can do. But the choice between e-books and printed books is not a zero sum game.  Print books do not have to disappear for e-books to flourish, and e-books don't have to be the only choice.  ""Printed books are for people who love printed books.  Digital books are for those who love digital books,"" Haberlin told me.  Maybe it's just that simple.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/facebook-affects-memory/,How Facebook Affects Your Memory,"You may want to think twice before posting that update to Facebook. New research has found that Facebook status updates are more memorable than lines from a book or the faces of strangers. Overall, the researchers found that Facebook status updates were one-and-a-half times more memorable than sentences from books and two-and-a-half times more memorable than faces. Those numbers represent remarkable differences in memory performance, researchers say. ""We were really surprised,"" said Laura Mickes, visiting scholar at UC San Diego and a senior research fellow at the University of Warwick. ""These kinds of gaps in [memory] performance are on a scale similar to the differences between amnesiacs and people with healthy memory."" The findings undercut popular assumptions about social media posts, she said. ""Facebook is updated roughly 30 million times an hour, so it’s easy to dismiss it as full of mundane, trivial bits of information that we will instantly forget as soon as we read them,"" Mickes said. ""But our study turns that view on its head, and by doing so gives us a really useful glimpse into the kinds of information we’re hardwired to remember."" In the research, which was published in the journal Memory and Cognition, participants studied more than 200 anonymous Facebook posts. Researchers picked posts that were close in length to sentences from books, and made sure to take out any irregularities in those postings that may have made them more memorable. ""Not only is the 'Facebook effect' on memory strong, but we replicated the effect each time we examined it,"" said Christine Harris, a psychology professor at UC San Diego. Researchers say that a number of factors make these posts more memorable; however, the top reason is that digital communications very closely resemble the way people talk. That is, researchers believe the similarity of online communication to everyday speech makes it more memorable than lines from books, which are more carefully composed.  ""One could view the past 5,000 years of painstaking, careful writing as the anomaly,"" said Nicholas Christenfeld, a psychology professor at UC San Diego. ""Modern technologies allow written language to return more closely to the casual, personal style of pre-literate communication. This is the style that resonates, and is remembered."" The research was co-authored by Daniel Bajic, Ryan Darby and Vivian Hwe of UC San Diego, and Jill Warker of the University of Scranton. Photo courtesy of Flickr, Mrs Logic

http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/facebook-graph-search-analysts/,Analysts Are Unimpressed With Facebook Graph Search,"Investors and consumers are still in the process of figuring out exactly what Facebook Graph Search means for the future of the social network, but right now, the first reaction from many analysts seems to be ""meh."" Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research Group, said in an investor note Tuesday that Facebook's new smarter search engine is a ""favorable"" development in that it shows the company is continuing to innovate, but he doubts about how much potential it has for monetization going forward. ""We are not assuming that the initiative will lead to meaningful revenue growth in the near future as several issues will limit Facebook's potential,"" Wieser wrote in the note. ""Our initial view is that the quantity of Facebook search volumes will be relatively low, as consumers are likely to continue prioritizing other sources (i.e. Google). Advertisers would consequently only use search if they can - or are perceived to - satisfy their goals efficiently with Facebook."" Likewise, Gartner analyst Ray Valdez suggested that the data shared between friends could be a powerful tool for search, but noted that the average user probably doesn't have that much data to share. ""Very well-connected individuals have a rich treasure trove of data that they can mine, but the average person's storehouse of data is much sparser and has less relevance to these queries,"" he told Reuters. Nate Elliott, a principal analyst at Forrester, went a step further by downplaying the feature as something Facebook should have released years ago. His verdict: ""not really a big deal."" ""I've no doubt that parsing a trillion connections between a billion users is an immense challenge,"" Elliott wrote in a blog post. ""But it's still just site search. The big news isn't that Facebook has fixed its search tool; the big news is that they didn't do this long ago."" Facebook's stock closed down by nearly 3% on Tuesday and quickly dropped below $30 a share in early trading Wednesday. The stock had been on a nice run this month in part due to the anticipation for the company's big press announcement yesterday.  Image courtesy of Facebook "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/facebook-graph-search-name/,"Hey Facebook, Rename Graph Search With One of These Suggestions","Facebook launched on Wednesday a smarter way to search on the site, allowing you to make complex queries to filter through friend networks and public profiles on the site. Although it's a huge leap forward for the company, we aren't feeling the name of the internal search system: Facebook Graph Search. Snooze. It's also clunky and definitely not user friendly.  SEE ALSO: Hands On With Facebook's Graph Search
 The name refers to the commonly-used tech term ""social graph,"" which includes each Facebook user's friends and followers network. But Facebook members are consumers more than they are tech experts, developers and marketers, so the name is way too technical for the typical user. It's been reported that the Facebook team has referred to it as ""Browse"" instead of Graph Search, but went with the latter in the days leading up to the launch. So we're asking you, dear readers: If you could rename Facebook Graph Search, which would you pick? Vote below or add your own suggestion in the comments.   Image via iStockphoto, LeicaFoto "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/facebook-online-dating/,How Facebook Graph Search Could Disrupt Online Dating,"When Mark Zuckerberg set out to build Facebook in the fall of 2003, he was still trying to figure out exactly what the website should be. One conclusion he arrived at pretty early on was that it shouldn't be branded as a dating site. ""I don't think people would sign up for the facebook thing if they knew it was for dating,"" Zuckerberg wrote at the time in an IM chat with his close high school friend Adam D'Angelo, who became Facebook's CTO and eventually went on to co-found Quora. ""I think people are skeptical about joining dating things too."" Though the look and feel of Facebook has changed in the years since, Zuckerberg and employees at the company have generally refrained from referring to the social network as a dating site, and from going after the online dating industry. That's why it was so striking to see Facebook tease a feature clearly intended for dating during the company's big press event on Tuesday for Graph Search, a new search engine that lets members use natural language to pull up recommendations for people, places and businesses from their social graph. Facebook reps demonstrated several uses for the product, ranging from recruiting to searching for restaurant recommendations. Then, at one point, a Facebook employee stood on stage and searched for ""friends of my friends who are single and living in San Francisco."" With that simple line, Facebook asserted itself as a potentially big player in the future of online dating.  ""Facebook just announced that they are moving in on the essence of online dating,"" said Dan Slater, author of Love in the Time of Algorithms, a history of online dating and its impact on our culture, which comes out next Thursday. The bedrock of most dating sites, according to Slater, has been the ability to discover people you don't know who share similar interests, whereas Facebook's focus was on helping you find the people you do know. Graph Search changes that by making it much easier to search for people outside your immediate social circle. ""That is a radical change for a community as big as Facebook."" With Graph Search, Facebook members can search for other single users and filter the results based on their interests, education, age, hometown, current city and more — all while using natural language. If you want to find single women under the age of 35 who are from your hometown and now live in New York, you can type exactly that into the search engine and see what pops up.  Image courtesy of Emily Price/Mashable At first blush, it might seem obvious that Facebook could be used for dating purposes. The social network has long served as a place to flirt by letting users advertise their relationship statuses, stalk one another's updates and Poke people they might be interested in. Indeed, one study last year from Stanford found that about 10% of couples who met online knew each other first in some other context and re-connected through a social network like Facebook. That said, several startups have tried in recent years to leverage Facebook's social graph for dating, but with only mixed success. Kingfish Labs raised $500,000 in early 2012 to use Facebook for dating, but its first Facebook application, Yoke, struggled to take off and the company itself was later acquired by BuzzFeed.  Yoke was able to rely on Facebook data to help its users find people who shared connections and interests with them, but the problem the dating app faced was providing a way for users to get in touch with those people. ""Cold friending or cold messaging someone on Facebook is uncomfortable because you don't know if the other person wants to be approached. On OkCupid it's not uncomfortable, it's standard,"" Rob Fishman,co-founder of Kingfish Labs, told Mashable. The assumption is that everyone on OkCupid is interested in dating, but on Facebook, even those who label themselves as ""single"" may not be in the market for a new relationship. ""There is no way for the third party to signal that 'yes, I want a date to approach me.'"" More fundamentally, Fishman says that his company found Facebook's Like data was often not fresh or comprehensive enough to serve as a match-making tool. ""Facebook Like data is actually pretty sparse and stale,"" Fishman says. ""If I asked you what your favorite movies are and went to your movies section on Facebook, I don't think they would match up. On OkCupid, people curate their profiles with a scalpel."" These two problems will likely limit the potential of Graph Search as a dating tool for now, but Fishman suggests this could change in the future if Facebook adds additional relationship status options like ""Looking for a date,"" and if the social network can accrue enough real-time interest data for users from its partnerships with other websites.  ""Someone is going to crack the nut of Facebook dating,"" Fishman says. ""It might well be Facebook."" The larger question then is whether Facebook can or will ever take on the big players in the online dating space. Investors appear to be concerned about this possibility, as the stock for IAC/InterActiveCorp — the parent company of Match and OkCupid — dropped by more than 2% after Facebook announced Graph Search on Tuesday.  ""I think the online dating business has to be looking at this announcement and saying this could either be the best thing ever for us, or it could be the beginning of the end,"" Slater says. If members of existing dating sites are successful in finding matches through Facebook, it could cut into their business. On the other hand, Slater says, Facebook could potentially help the industry by removing whatever ""cultural barrier"" remains for online dating.  About a third of the single population in the U.S. currently uses online dating sites — a number that has been relatively flat in recent years. Both Slater and Fishman suggest that Facebook has the potential to make it more common for people to use the Internet to find dates, without necessarily stealing away many customers from other online dating sites.  Even before Facebook made its big announcement, Slater says he noticed that a growing number of non-dating platforms are being used for dating purposes, from match-making apps on Spotify to social discovery tools like Highlight. Meanwhile, he says some dating websites are starting to re-brand a bit by taking the ""pink hearts"" off their homepage with the goal of being a little more welcoming to those who might previously have been put off by the idea of online dating.  Facebook could fit nicely in this trend by serving as a more general social venue where casual users occasionally browse for dates without necessarily branding themselves as online daters. ""It's very similar to going to a club or a poetry reading or whatever your thing is [to meet people],"" Slater says, whereas ""online dating is more like going to a speed-dating event."" At least in this sense, Facebook could help online dating function a little more like offline dating.  Image courtesy of iStockPhoto, jgroup "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/facebook-twitter-flu/,"250,000 Social Media Users in U.S. Said They Got the Flu","If you came down with the flu in the last six weeks — and mentioned the fact on Twitter or Facebook — you're not alone.  Since the beginning of December, there have been 626,379 mentions of flu on those two services, according to sentiment analysis firm Crimson Hexagon. That's a 2,336% increase on the previous month, with flu mentions spiking in early January. Of those, fully 40% of the posts included the phrase ""I have the flu."" That represents more than 250,000 Twitter or Facebook users with the dreaded winter bug.   Another 10% of users reported their friends or family had the flu. That kind of post peaked more recently, on Jan. 13.  The good news: Overall mentions of flu appear to be dropping precipitously. Either we're all getting better, or we've stopped posting about our condition.  According to these figures, Twitter is the service we're more likely to turn to when sick. It was the source for 90% of Crimson Hexagon's mentions. This has been an unusually rough flu season, especially on the East Coast — and technology has been in the forefront of determining just how bad it is. Google.org, in partnership with the CDC, has noted a spike in searches for flu-related topics that far outpaces the last seven years. The problem appears just as great on the other side of the Atlantic. In the UK, 47% of tweets and Facebook posts about the flu were from someone who had it. (Those figures also include cases of norovirus, which is particularly virulent in Europe this winter.) Social media has been used to predict the opening weekend box office takings for movies; it has been less successful when it comes to predicting elections.  But is it reliable when it comes to the spread of disease? Give us your take in the comments.

The company has rolled out a new feature in the U.S. that allows Facebook Messenger app users to place voice calls with friends over the social network using their data connection or Wi-Fi. The feature started rolling out in the United States Wednesday, and comes as a simple “free calling” button in the existing app. Users don’t have to update the existing Messenger app in order to take advantage of the feature.  Free calls are placed by tapping the ""i"" icon on the top right side of chat, and then selecting ""Free Call"" from your friend's contact card. Your friends will need to have Facebook's stand-alone Messenger app installed on their phone in order for the feature to work (otherwise the ""Free Call"" icon will appear grey and marked out). Calls have a similar look and feel as traditional voice calls you might make on your iPhone.  Facebook started testing the feature in Canada earlier this month. The functionality was announced alongside an update to the company’s iOS and Android apps that allows Facebook users to send short voice messages to each other. Vonage launched an app in 2010 that allowed Facebook users to call friends for free, however, the app required that both parties have the Vonage for Facebook app installed on their devices in order to do so. Messenger is one of several stand-alone apps developed by Facebook. The company often uses the apps to test new features with power users before deciding which features to include in the traditional Facebook app for the social network's general audience.

The larger of the two grants, a $2.1 million gift, was given to the Sunlight Foundation. The Foundation will use the money to grow its local programming, particularly to create consistant standards for open data in all U.S. cities. Another $1.6 million was given to mySociety, a UK charity that builds open source codes for local authorities, governments and corporations.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/google-says-it-didnt-kill-that-donkey/,Google Says it Didn't Kill That Donkey,"Google on Wednesday answered a query that had been consuming the blogosphere for 24 hours: Why did the donkey lie down on the road? The speculation began when an image of a donkey lying on its side in the middle of a dirt road in the Kweneng region of Botswana emerged on Street View. Then @TheRealSheldonCooper tweeted his suspicions about the photo to his 149,000 followers.  I think google street view ran over a donkey in Botswana;maps.gstatic.com/m/streetview/?… — Dr. Sheldon Cooper(@TheRealSheldonC) January 14, 2013 After a social media uproar, Google addressed the controversy on its Google Maps blog on Wednesday. In a post entitled ""Never ass-ume,"" Kei Kawai, group product manager for Google Maps provided photographic evidence that the donkey got up and walked away after the above image was taken.  So what was the donkey doing? Kawai speculated that the donkey was taking a dust bath. This isn't the first time Google has posted a provocative image on Street View. Past sightings include an apparently headless man, a guy getting arrested and what looks like a beam from outer space. Steve Jobs was also apparently spotted in a Street View image as well.  Take a minute and think about the gargantuan task of photographing every inch of road in the world. Is your mind blown? Now you may understand why Google needs so many cars. Sometimes Google has to employ a tricycle for those hard-to-reach streets. Using a trike also decreases the carbon footprint created by sending a bunch of cars to just drive around.  There has been much controversy swirling around how the tech behemoth handles the data it collects on the public, but this is proof that Google wants to keep everyone's most personal information anonymous -- even if they're not really people at all. Some people see the Google cars right away and make an effort to be noticed. This guy is certainly a strong contender to be the leader of the group. Check out the next few pics to see his comrades. Some websites feature the legacy version of this photo of two gentlemen in hot pursuit of the Google car. For a reason that defies logic, the two have been blurred almost completely. But look closely at their shadows and you can still see their intentions. Maybe Google disapproves of using accessories intended for exclusive use in the sea on land? This looks like a shot right out of an '80s movie where the lovable main character is getting chased home from school by three bullies on much more powerful, motorized scooters. If anyone ever has doubt about this kid's ability to pop a sick wheelie, he need only refer to them to Google Maps, the ultimate proof. Let's be honest. If you saw the Google car going through your block, you'd be curious what it is, too. You might even bust out your camcorder and film the event if you had one in your backseat. Looks like these guys did just that. Maybe next time, this guy will be a little more subtle about checking out the next woman that walks by him. Or at least he'll be more aware of the car with the giant orb on the roof? Let's hope so. Guys in Italy apparently have much in common with guys in Florida. This man is a little bolder though. We wonder how he chose what to look at - the strange Google camera car or the attractive girl on the sidewalk? We just hope this wasn't a fateful glance like the driver in the next photo. You: Officer, I was distracted by the car with Google graphics all over it and a six-foot beam with a giant camera orb attached to the top! Officer: Sorry, you're still at fault. Here's your ticket. A slew of new mobile apps allow you to open and close your garage door when you're miles away from home. Maybe this is evidence that it's better to press the button while you're there. Either this guy isn't too hip on the idea of the Google Street View camera or he really has to go to the bathroom. Sure, that fence would easily keep out the prying eyes of the few people walking by, but will it keep out the curious eyes of everyone else using the Internet? Start investing in fence companies - they're probably going to start seeing an uptick in materials needs. We're not sure, but we don't think there are any bikes down there. But maybe... A camera on top of a long pole on top of a car is bound to run into some low-hanging objects every now and again. Of course, you knew these kinds of photos were coming. People do weird things and the omni-present street cam will catch you doing the weird things that you do. Like this guy, pulling his penguin friend around while riding his giant bicycle. Sometimes the Google Street Cam melds two images together to form entirely new things! Like this photo of Alex from Madagascar turned into a strange lion cyclops. Apparently avian species are also curious about the globe-like camera device attached to roofs of Google cars. If you look closely, you can see Google is smiling ear to ear.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/hubble-telescope-deep-field-views/,Hubble Telescope to Snap 6 New Views of Universe,"The Hubble Space Telescope's iconic ""Deep Field"" photo wowed the world in 1996 by revealing a huge collection of galaxies hiding inside a patch of the sky that looked like nothing more than blank space. Now NASA plans to image six more ""empty"" bits of sky for a whole new set of deep fields that could revolutionize astronomy once again. Hubble captured the Deep Field by staring at the same point over many hours, letting particles of light from extremely distant objects slowly pile up to reveal celestial bodies that would otherwise be too faint to see. Since the original photo's release, Hubble looked even longer at the same spot to create the ""Ultra Deep Field"" in 2004 and then the ""eXtreme Deep Field"" in 2012. But the new effort, called Hubble Frontier Fields, will be the first to try a similar technique on some new areas of the heavens. These photos won't go quite as deep as the Ultra Deep Field, but will represent some of the deepest images of the universe ever taken. ""As iconic as the Ultra Deep Field is, now we'll have six that are almost as nice,"" said Hubble scientist Dan Coe of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md., which manages the telescope.  SEE ALSO: Hubble's Ultra Deep Field Revealed (Video)
 The Hubble Frontier Fields will collect light for about 45 hours each, spread over a period of three years, imaging objects that existed in the first 500 million years after the Big Bang. Plus, in a new twist, astronomers will image each of the six blank patches of sky in combination with nearby galaxy clusters, whose gravity can act as a cosmic magnifying lens to zoom in on small, distant objects behind them.  Researchers will ""observe six galaxy clusters and blank fields in parallel,"" Coe told SPACE.com. ""While they're observing a cluster, the other camera is just far enough away where it's not really looking at the cluster anymore. It'll be essentially blank. To really go deep in both of these at the same time, that's never been done before."" The added magnification boost of the clusters' gravity should make these pictures the deepest glimpses of the universe yet. The shots could capture galaxies that are older and farther away than anything ever seen before. ""Some of them will be among the most distant galaxies yet found,"" said Coe, who led the study of one of the current contenders for farthest galaxy ever seen, MACS0647-JD, which lies about 13.3 billion light-years away. The original Deep Field photo revealed about 3,000 previously unknown galaxies in a patch of sky only 2.5 arc-minutes across, or about one 24-millionth of the whole sky. The new fields will determine whether that huge haul was a fluke, or if almost any patch of blank sky contains a similar wealth of treasures.""You don't know, it might be a special part of the sky you're looking at,"" Coe said. Hubble will begin observing the first of the new fields later this year. The nearly23-year-old telescope is still going strong after five upgrades from visiting space shuttle crews. NASA hopes to keep the observatory running until at least 2018, when its successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, is due to launch. Image courtesy of NASA

Yaroslav Trofimov discovered a street named ""Bad Monkey"" and another named ""MoJo Way."" After discovering these unlikely streets on Apple Maps, he shared his findings to Twitter, UN Dispatch reports.  So is one of #Kabul 's main streets really called Bad Monkey, as the new Apple Maps on my iPad claim?#TooGoodToBeTrue twitter.com/yarotrof/statu…  The street behind the #Kabul Serena, meanwhile, has been appropriately renamed MoJo Way by #Apple #Maps... #fail twitter.com/yarotrof/statu… But how did these streets achieve these misnomers? Apple copied old maps from crowdsourced and edited mapping platform OpenStreetMap without fully fact checking street names.  The maps copied by Apple are some of the earliest created by a group of Afghan university students. The students assigned spoof names to nameless or disputed streets. Though corrections have since been made to OpenStreetMaps, the Apple maps inherited the initial errors. ""The issue is that Apple took an old snapshot of the OpenStreetMap data and hasn’t updated it since, so things like 'personal' street names are in there, even if they have been fixed since,"" Kate Chapman, Indonesia-based director of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, told UN Dispatch. ""The fact that they don’t update the data shows that the incentive for people to improve the map just isn’t going to be there."" At press time, you could still find Bad Monkey, MoJo Way, and even ""Hillbilly Hameed"" in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. Seems like Apple isn't making any quick effort to correct Maps' faux pas in areas with low iPhone and iPad penetration.  Image courtesy of Flickr, Doctor Yuri "

If you're using a tablet, you know the difficulties of maneuvering and angling to squeeze everyone in on the conference call or show off your new pup to Mom.  Revolve Robotics, a San Francisco-based start-up company, created a robot to take away all that awkwardness. KUBI is a motorized tablet stand designed to pivot and rotate for added hands-free convenience.  KUBI, which means ""neck"" in Japanese, has a 300 degree pan and 90 degree tilt to allow users to look around the room. Creators Marcus Rosenthal and Ilya Polyakov wanted to create a ""natural experience that actually gets the KUBI out of the way and lets your loved ones enjoy the experience without knowing it's there,"" they say on their Indiegogo page. The remote user can change point of view with a secondary device. For example, if you were using your iPad to FaceTime, you could login to the KUBI Kontroller website on your smartphone and use a grid interface to control motion. Check out the video above for more information.  No cables are necessary, since it connects via Bluetooth. The KUBI fits tablets 7.9"" to 10.6"" screen size and works in both portrait and landscape mode. Though it doesn't have motion tracking on its own just yet, a ""following"" feature may be included if Revolve Robotics doubles its $100,000 fundraising goal.  The stand is available for pre-order on Indiegogo for $199.  Would you use a KUBI? Are there any devices you use to make video calling easier? Let us what you think in the comments.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/largest-quasar/,'Largest Structure in Universe' Discovered by Scientists," The largest thing ever? That's quite the claim. Astronomers from the University of Central Lancashire, in England, have discovered a collection of luminous and highly radiant quasars that they're saying is the largest known structure in the universe. The large quasar group (LQG) spans almost four billion light-years across at its widest point, Science Daily reports.  Quasars are the brightest known objects in the universe. They tend to assemble in large groups, Space.com says, with the previous record measuring 600 million light-years across. This new discovery, however, is on an entirely different scale.   SEE ALSO: The 10 Biggest Space Moments of 2012
 The LQG is so large, in fact, that it's challenging the cosmological principle. The principle states that when ""viewed on a sufficiently large scale, the properties of the universe are the same for all observers"" — basically, the universe looks homogenous if you zoom out far enough. But the size of the newly discovered LQG make it a landmark regardless of where you're viewing it from, the report says.  The researchers from the project will publish the remainder of their findings in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. In the meantime, watch the video above to learn more.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/london-helicopter-crash/,Footage of London Helicopter Crash Aftermath Uploaded to YouTube," Two people were killed and 12 more injured after a helicopter struck a construction crane and crashed into a busy street in London Wednesday morning. Almost immediately after the incident, video of the aftermath was posted to YouTube.  The footage here, which Mashable verified by cross-referencing local media reports and Google Street View data, shows flaming wreckage on Wandsworth Road in central London. It was uploaded by YouTube user ""niczerogoeshome"" and, speaking to the power of citizen journalism, has since been picked up by major media outlets including Reuters. Note: It's not graphic. The helicopter, according to the BBC, struck a crane atop The Tower, a residential skyscraper currently under construction on the bank of the Thames. It then crashed to the ground, killing the pilot and one bystander while wounding several others and igniting nearby cars and buildings. Bad weather is possibly among the factors to blame for the deadly crash: London was blanketed in a heavy fog Wednesday morning, prompting the helicopter's pilot to request a diversion to a close-by heliport in order to land safely before the accident occurred. The scene of the crash can be found on Google Street View: View Larger Map Photo/video courtesy of niczerogoeshome "

After a lengthy and unusual series of events, McAfee was eventually found in Guatemala where he faked a heart attack and was later deported to the United States. McAfee is best known for his computer anti-virus software. While Warner Brothers has bought the rights to the story, that doesn’t necessarily mean that it will make a film.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/mcommerce-31-billion-2017-forrester/,Forrester: Mobile Commerce to Quadruple to $31 Billion in Next 5 Years,"Mobile commerce, or ""mcommerce,"" has had a transformative (and highly publicized) impact on some businesses, including Amazon, eBay and flash sales sites like Gilt. But for the vast majority of retail companies, mobile represents only a neglible fraction of total sales, and it's likely to stay that way for the next half-decade, according to data from Forrester provided exclusively to Mashable. Sales of physical retail goods and services made on smartphones were $8 billion in the U.S. last year, accounting for 3% of online sales and less than 1% of total retail sales. (Those numbers have been driven up by some outliers, like the aforementioned Amazon and eBay, which have mobile sales in the billions, per Forrester's estimates.) For most U.S. retailers, mobile represents only 1.5% of online sales. Over the next five years, total mobile sales are expected to grow 33% annually to $31 billion, making up 9% of online sales in 2017.  As someone who makes a purchase via a smartphone at least once per week, I wonder what's holding the rest of smartphone owners back. According to Forrester, of the 132 million Americans with an Internet-connected smartphone, only a quarter made a purchase on their devices last year. The research outfit blames the low transaction rates on retailers, who have made it difficult for customers to check out and pay on smartphones, or are otherwise investing in apps that consumers aren't aware of. Although Forrester didn't mention it, we wonder if the smartphones themselves aren't partly to blame: Even with image-zooming capabilities, smartphones' screen sizes make it difficult to examine products closely, particularly in the apparel category. With mobile retail sales still so small, is it worth investing in? Forrester says yes. Ensure that your mobile commerce site has a fast checkout solution, like PayPal Express or Checkout by Amazon. Make sure your mobile websites are responsively design so that it is optimized for the wide variety of device screen sizes on the market. And above all, invest in creating a great tablet experience — Although there are less of them out there, they're generating significant traffic and sales. Image courtesy of Flickr, Ed Yourdon "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/mobile-app-revenue/,7 Ways Mobile Apps Are Driving Revenue for Businesses,"From leveraging specific features like GPS all the way down to the mere fact that people are walking around with Internet-connected computers in their pockets, smartphones open a whole new world of opportunities for marketers at businesses from large and small. The following are some key ways businesses are getting an extra boost via mobile apps. Back in 2010, then-Google CEO Eric Schmidt talked about how the future of mobile would be autonomous and serendipitous. That is, mobile devices would present users with information about the world around them in an automatic way. In Schmidt’s example, as he walked around a particularly storied neighborhood of San Francisco, an app would passively display information about the history of places he passed. But the technology has become a reality, and a boon to business. Here are some ways businesses could use geo-targeted push notifications.
 A band on tour could notify fans in a particular city that tickets there are nearly sold out or remind concert-goers to show up early so they don’t miss the opening act A national chain could easily send city- or region-specific notifications about special offers based on what users in that area are interested in A restaurant could boost loyalty by sending a special offer to customers who had been in the past year but not in the last two months A store could announce a sale on umbrellas coupled with a weather alert to nearby users when it’s predicted to rain soon One of the single biggest opportunities for businesses to leverage mobile apps is that smartphones have opened a whole new world of shopping and engagement opportunities. Interactions between customers and businesses have grown to become geo-agnostic. The morning commute, waiting in line for movie tickets and sitting in a doctor's office are all places people could be using their smartphones to shop your store or engage with your brand. These pockets of free time that were previously biased toward reading, can now be used by consumers for so much more. A mobile app maximizes opportunities for reaching users in these new pockets of time. A push notification might remind users of a nearly abandoned shopping cart, bringing them back into the shopping experience. A more seamless experience of stored login and billing information means an easier path to transact. The classic targeted ad story goes something like this: A potential homeowner is stuck in traffic on his daily commute home and looks out his window to read a sign on a new housing development that says, “If you lived here, you’d be home by now.” Now multiply that times a billion and you’ve got the power of modern, smartphone-powered targeted advertising. These smart ads can target users by their specific location, displaying ads that are geographic and contextually optimized. Businesses can make on-the-fly tweaks to campaigns based on what works in a particular geographic location. They can also display coupons to potential users nearby or help users find the business by advertising directly on a map. When you tie in technologies like push notifications and geotargeting, magical things start to happen. Businesses can use data collected through geotracking and ad campaigns to deliver just-in-time offers. Groupon Now is just the tip of the iceberg. The power of mobile apps allows businesses to do all sorts of cool things to boost revenue. For example, movie theaters and very time-sensitive inventory that goes to waste at a particular time and can’t be recovered. The theater could track and send a coupon to users who are nearby and looked up information about showtimes but didn’t make a purchase. A bar with a slow night could offer an impromptu extended happy hour to past patrons who are nearby. Ever walked into a store, shopped around a bit, and then walked out without making a purchase? That’s called a ""bounce."" Online, users bounce for a variety of reasons and on mobile the reasons are even greater. Users might not have a credit card handy, typing in account information is considered too tedious or they simply get distracted and put their phone back in their pocket. Fortunately, one way to combat transaction abandonment is through automatic address fill-in. Using a phone’s GPS, transactional apps can detect a user’s location and automatically fill in address data. Seamless, the leading online food delivery service, has been aggressively marketing its mobile apps that automatically detects a user’s location to fill in a delivery address and display restaurants able to deliver there. One of the really powerful tools available to online businesses is that they can easily track every move customers make from the moment a user lands on the site. What engaged users and what turned them off? Where, exactly, in the online store did a user go and what did they do when they got there? These are really easy questions for webmasters to answer, but good luck figuring that out in brick-and-mortar store. That is, unless you’re using the Wi-Fi signals emitted from smartphones in your customers pockets and purses. Tracking signals from mobile devices is opening a whole new world of analytics and data-gathering opportunities for retailers stuck in the physical world. Many brick-and-mortar retailers complain about showrooming, the practice whereby shoppers visit a physical store to inspect the goods in person all the while intending to ultimately make their purchase online, where prices are usually cheaper. While the traditional retailer might be on the losing end of that transaction, the customer and online retailer are winning. Price comparison tools are helping etailers drive additional traffic and sales. Amazon, for example, even went so far as to offer a $5 discount to shoppers who scanned items using their price comparison tool. Mobile apps are helping businesses increase revenue largely by increasing efficiency. Instead of advertising to broad spectrum, users can be narrowly targeted. Businesses can lure back customers who haven’t been in a while but are nearby. Customers can shop during small pockets of time that would have have previously gone to waste. Businesses can precision-discount inventory in the last moments before it would have gone to waste. And all these little efficiencies are resulting in more revenue for businesses while, by and large, enhancing the overall experience for users. Image courtesy of Flickr, yourdon "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/nasa-inflatable-space-station/,Inside NASA's Deal for Inflatable Space Station Room,"A new deal between NASA and a commercial spaceflight company to add a privately built module to the International Space Station could lead to future uses of the novel space technology beyond low-Earth orbit, space agency and company officials say. NASA will pay $17.8 million to Bigelow Aerospace of North Las Vegas to build an inflatable module, test it and prep it for flight. The Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM) is to be launched around the summer of 2015. The space agency and Bigelow officials provided details of the contract in a Las Vegas briefing today (Jan. 16). The new inflatable BEAM will be launched to the International Space Station by a Falcon 9 rocket built by another private spaceflight company, California-based SpaceX. The module will be cocooned inside the unpressurized cargo hold of SpaceX's Dragon capsule atop the Falcon 9. NASA has already purchased the launch of the SpaceX Falcon under a separate Commercial Resupply Services contract. The module will be installed on an open berth of the station's Node 3 connecting module using a robotic arm. Once it is attached, the inflatable room will be activated by station astronauts, adding to the volume of orbiting laboratory.  SEE ALSO: Photos: Bigelow's Inflatable Space Station Idea
 The module is cylindrical, weighs roughly 3,000 pounds (1,360 kilograms) and is about 13 feet (4 meters) long and 10.5 feet (3.2 m) wide. Bigelow Aerospace's founder and president is Robert Bigelow, a Las Vegas-based general contractor, real estate tycoon, hotel businessman and developer. Since 1999, his company has been focused on creating affordable inflatable space habitats for national space agencies and corporate clients. In 2006 and 2007 the firm launched orbiting prototypes of its expandable habitat technology, Genesis 1 and Genesis 2. Work is ongoing within Bigelow Aerospace on BA 330 modules, structures that offer 12,000 cubic feet (330 cubic meters) of internal space.  SEE ALSO: Private Space Stations: A Gallery
 Michael Gold, director of Washington, D.C., operations and business growth for Bigelow Aerospace LLC, based in Chevy Chase, Md., said: ""With Genesis 1 and 2, Bigelow Aerospace showed the world that it can achieve escape velocity from high costs. We're going to do this again with the BEAM, bringing both innovation and a vital demonstration of affordability to the crown jewel of NASA's human spaceflight program, the International Space Station."" At this time, NASA's planned use of the BEAM is for technology demonstration, to validate experimental expandable habitat technology and let the space agency become more familiar with it, Gold told SPACE.com in an exclusive interview. ""I'm told the BEAM will be acoustically the quietest location aboard the station, due to the non-metallic nature of the structure,"" he said. NASA's interest in the module for the International Space Station was first reported on SPACE.com by this reporter in January 2011 — so why the long glide path, some two years, for the project to become a reality? In actuality, the program ""moved forward with relative alacrity,"" Gold responded. ""The ISS is the pinnacle of the human spaceflight program. NASA went through a thorough amount of analysis prior to agreeing about BEAM … Analysis and study does take time,"" Gold said. ""It demonstrates the attention and commitment to safety and quality that both NASA and Bigelow Aerospace have."" For Bigelow, there is another bonus from having BEAM  attached to the space station: the chance to generate more business. ""Many in the foreign community perceive NASA as the gold star. I can think of no stronger statement relative to NASA's confidence both in Bigelow Aerospace and expandable habitat technology than their desire to place BEAM aboard the ISS,"" Gold said. ""That speaks volumes not just domestically, but possibly more importantly, overseas as well. I think that any sovereign client or potential clientele should be paying attention to this."" Gold said the private entrepreneurial firm is pleased to be working with NASA to further validate the promise and benefits of expandable habitat technology – and not only in low-Earth orbit, but beyond. Beyond BEAM, Bigelow Aerospace is ""moving aggressively"" on the larger BA 330 module, ""dedicating a great deal of resources"" to expeditiously push forward an expandable habitat of that size. According to the Bigelow Aerospace website, the BA 330 can function as an independent space station, and several BA 330 habitats can be connected together in a modular fashion to create an even larger and more capable orbital space complex. Robert Bigelow and his team have extensively blueprinted concepts for their expandable habitats to be used at other destinations. ""Expandable habitats are an enabling technology that will make the dream of robust beyond-LEO human space exploration a reality,"" Gold said. ""Regardless of the ultimate destination, be it L2 [Lagrange Point 2], the surface of the moon or even a historic mission to Mars, the large volumes provided by Bigelow Aerospace systems, combined with enhanced protection from radiation and physical debris, make habitats such as the BA 330 an essential part of any realistic beyond-LEO architecture."" Gold said he knows Capitol Hill wants to see a robust beyond-LEO human space exploration strategy, but that new funding will be hard to come by. ""The BA 330 and expandable habitats will not just offer enhanced protection from radiation and micrometeorites, but protect future astronauts from a much more dangerous threat …lack of funding,"" Gold concluded.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/notre-dame-teo-hoax/,Notre Dame Star Te'o's Dead Girlfriend Was Social Media Hoax,"A touching story that captivated the sports world last fall was an elaborate social media-fueled hoax involving the fictitious illness and death of a beautiful young woman, who was allegedly the girlfriend of one of college football's biggest stars.  The only remaining question: Was Notre Dame Heisman Trophy candidate Manti Te'o the victim or the perpetrator of the deeply sophisticated case of stolen identify and fake death?  A Facebook post by the Notre Dame football program and statement released by Te'o both say he was unaware of the scam until late December.   The lies were exposed on Wednesday by the sports blog Deadspin, which reported the girlfriend never existed. She never died and she never lived. The photos associated with her social media activity were reportedly, in fact, stolen from an account of a 22-year-old California woman who was oblivious to the whole thing.  Here's the backstory: Te'o said he began dating a young woman named Lennay Kekua in early 2012. in September, he learned of her death following a car accident and subsequent leukemia diagnosis, nearly at the same time he was told his grandmother had died as well.  Burdened by grief, Te'o still played spectacularly this season and led Notre Dame back to glory and a spot in this year's BCS national title game. Along the way, fans were touched by many tweets he sent to the supposedly deceased Kekua's Twitter account:  @lennaykay I miss you! — Manti Te'o (@MTeo_5) November 7, 2012 Tales of Te'o's heroism in the face of tragedy were published by multiple national news outlets including Sports Illustrated, ESPN and CBS.   Deadspin's long report hit the sports web like a bombshell on Wednesday, immediately sparking multiple worldwide Twitter trends as stunned fans reacted to the news. Dennis Brown, Notre Dame's assistant vice president, soon posted a message to the Notre Dame Football Facebook Page — which has more than 350,000 online fans — saying that Te'o had not perpetrated any hoax. He was, in fact, the victim of an evil and cold-hearted deception by other people, Brown wrote:  On Dec. 26, Notre Dame coaches were informed by Manti Te’o and his parents that Manti had been the victim of what appears to be a hoax in which someone using the fictitious name Lennay Kekua apparently ingratiated herself with Manti and then conspired with others to lead him to believe she had tragically died of leukemia. The University immediately initiated an investigation to assist Manti and his family in discovering the motive for and nature of this hoax. While the proper authorities will continue to investigate this troubling matter, this appears to be, at a minimum, a sad and very cruel deception to entertain its perpetrators.
 That post quest was shared more than 850 times in just over half an hour, with many commenters expressing skepticism about its veracity and calling it little more than cynical spin. Te'o soon released a statement of his own, professing his innocence and calling the entire episode ""painful and humiliating.""  At a minimum, the twisted and bizarre tale raises a bevy of followup questions: Was Te'o in on the scam? Why? How did he think it was possible to not get discovered? If he was in fact the victim here, how did the people targeting him not expect to eventually get caught? And how could someone who never existed fool a real-live person when the two had supposedly met in person?  Give us your take in the comments.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/nra-ad-goes-after-obamas-kids/,NRA Ad Goes After Obama's Kids," After an initial period of reticence following the Newtown shootings, the National Rifle Association has come out with an acerbic web-only ad calling President Obama an ""elitist hypocrite"" because his kids attend a school with armed guards. ""Are the President's kids more important than yours?"" the ad asks. ""Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools when his kids are protected by armed guards at their schools?"" The NRA posited the idea of armed guards in schools on Dec. 21, a week after the tragic Newtown massacre. The ad comes as Obama plans to unveil a ""package of concrete proposals"" relating to gun violence on Wednesday.  What do you think? Is this an effective argument? Let us know in the comments.

Anyone who's tried to park in Manhattan can attest to the impossibly narrow lanes and no-nonsense pedestrians.  Design firm Pentagram is trying to make the ordeal a little less stressful by creating clearer parking signs. Taking a cue from Twitter, the 6,300 new signs give drivers information in no more than 140 characters.

  President Barack Obama and Vice President Joseph Biden are set to unveil their proposals to reform gun control laws at the White House on Wednesday at 11:55 a.m. ET. You can watch live here. The proposals are expected to include universal background checks, a renewed assault weapons ban and a prohibition on high-capacity magazines, according to CNN and others. Obama put Biden in charge of a task force on gun control following last month's shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Over the past several weeks, Biden has met with several key stakeholders including victims' groups, pro-gun groups such as the National Rifle Association, the entertainment and video games industries, and law enforcement officials. SEE ALSO: Conn. Shooting Instantly Ignites Gun Control Debate
 New York this week became the first state to pass stricter gun control laws in the aftermath of Sandy Hook, strengthening the state's assault weapons ban, reducing the number of bullets allowed in a single magazine and requiring mental health professionals to report persons they believe are a danger to themselves or others. The laws fortify New York's existing assault weapons ban, limit the number of bullets allowed in magazines and strengthen rules that govern the mentally ill, which includes a requirement to report potentially harmful behavior. New York also authorized the creation of a statewide firearms database. Photo courtesy of Flickr, Pete Souza/The White House "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/obama-game-violence/,Obama Calls Out Video Games in Gun Violence Address,"President Barack Obama suggested more research needed to be done on the affect of video games and other ""violent media"" on children during his Wednesday morning address detailing his plan for lowering gun violence in the United States. ""Congress will fund research into the effects that violent video games have on young minds,"" he said. ""We don’t benefit from ignorance. We don’t benefit from not knowing the science of this epidemic of violence."" Obama's 23-part plan gave more details on how this research might be conducted: The Centers of Disease Control and other scientific organizations would receive funding to conduct investigations into ""the causes of gun violence."" Funding for these programs need to be approved by Congress, and Obama is asking for at least $10 million for that cause. The CDC has conducted research on gun ownership and gun violence in the past, but according to NBC News, a 1996 appropriations bill cut the organization's funding and prevented it from conducting any research that would ""advocate or promote"" gun control. The Entertainment Software Association, which represents America's video game makers, released a statement supporting further research. The ESA, along with several large game publishers, participated in a meeting last Friday with Vice President Joe Biden on the topic of violence in video games. ""We concur with President Obama‟s call today for all Americans to do their part, and agree with the report's conclusion that the entertainment and video game industries have a responsibility to give parents tools and choices about the movies and programs their children watch and the games their children play,"" the statement said. ""The same entertainment is enjoyed across all cultures and nations, but tragic levels of gun violence remain unique to our country. Scientific research and international and domestic crime data all point toward the same conclusion: entertainment does not cause violent behavior in the real world. “We will embrace a constructive role in the important national dialogue around gun violence in the United States, and continue to collaborate with the Administration and Congress as they examine the facts that inform meaningful solutions,"" the statement continued. The International Game Developer Association also weighed in with comments that echoed the open letter they had sent to Vice President Joe Biden last week. The organization's executive director Kate Edwards said she hopes the CDC confirms there is not a connection between games and violent actions:
 ""In response to the President's executive order, the IGDA welcomes more evidence-based research into the effects of our work to add to the large body of existing scientific literature that clearly shows no causal link between video game violence and real violence. We support the President's call for new government research, with an emphasis on examining the totality of imaginary violence and not focused only on video games. We especially encourage the new research to explore all aspects of violence in media, including their potential benefits. For example, recent research shows a steam valve effect in which violent video gameplay helps release stress and aggression before it can lead to violence. Others studies have indicated that recent declines in real world violence can be attributed in part to potentially violent people spending more time looking for thrills in video games instead of on the streets.""
 Consumer advocacy group Common Sense Media, which helps parents become more savvy consumers of media for their children, supported the president's plan for action. ""Parents across this country have expressed their strong concern about the possible influence of media violence on their children, and about how hard it is to shield their kids from such gratuitous violence that is marketed to them from a very young age,"" said CSM CEO James Steyer. ""By calling on Congress to direct $10 million to the Center for Disease Control for research on the possible linkage between violent video games and other media images and acts of violence, our country is taking an important first step towards protecting the most vulnerable among us."" Do you support Obama's call for more research into video games' affect on children? Let us know your thoughts in the comments. Image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images News. "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/online-courses-end-college-experience/,Could Online Education Be the End of the Typical College Experience?,"No one ever recalls their online education experience with as much fondness as those remembering their college dorm years.  San Jose State University in San Jose, Calif., is piloting a new program to offer remedial classes online. The university is partnering with Silicon Valley start-up Udacity, an online education platform. At first, the program will let in around 300 students and offer only three courses, but there's a possibility this online education for first-year classes could expand to all California state schools if it's a success. The California State University system is the largest university system in the U.S., so the college experience for future students could potentially be drastically different.  As the New York Times noted, California Governor Jerry Brown has been pushing schools to adopt online classes as a way to make education more affordable for students.  CSU Chancellor Timothy White tells the Sacramento Bee that these online courses can expand access to popular ""bottleneck"" courses, entry-level courses that are required for students to move on to classes for majors.  Dr. Katherine Cohen, CEO and founder of IvyWise, a company that offers education counseling and tutoring for students, tells Mashable this may be the California State University school system's first major foray into online education, but other universities and organizations instituted online courses some time ago.  ""Distance learning has been taken to a whole new level in recent years with the introduction of MOOCs (massive open online courses) taught by well-respected professors from revered universities, including Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, aimed at large-scale participation and open access via the web,"" she says.  These online education companies give people unprecedented access to higher learning, she continues. Students from anywhere in the world can get access to classes at Ivy League universities at a much more affordable rate.  But what's missing is the typical college experience, in which students, now legal adults, get to have more independence outside their parents' homes and move into dorms or campus housing. With online classes, students could continue to live at home with their parents in order to save money on living expenses.  ""Now, there's certainly something to be said for the college experience,"" Cohen said. ""College is where students build their social and professional networks, ones they will rely upon throughout the rest of their lives. Students living on campus also tend to mature much more quickly, as they take on new responsibilities and maintain a new level of independence. These are aspects of the college experience that can get lost in a large, virtual college classroom."" TechCrunch predicts that, if successful, this pilot program will spell an end for community colleges, part-time teaching faculty and, eventually, graduate programs, since teaching jobs could dry up. It ends with a small number of students actually receiving face-time with professors.  As more universities add online courses, do you think the typical college experience will change for the better or worse? Tell us in the comments.  Photo courtesy Flickr, Horia Varlan. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/penny-arcade-web-series/,Penny Arcade Gets Real With Competitive Web Series,"If you're not a n00b, then you read Penny Arcade, the long-running video game-themed webcomic by Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik.  In the 15 years since its debut, Penny Arcade has grown far beyond the confines of its panels. Holkins and Krahulik (a.k.a. Tycho and Gabe in the comic) host Penny Arcade Expo (PAX), a series of hugely popular annual gaming festivals. They also star as themselves on their web show, Penny Arcade: The Series. Only this season, they're switching up the programming a bit.  After a successful 2012 crowdfunding drive, a surplus of funds allowed the guys to revisit an idea from the past: a competitive reality show about webcomics. Why couldn't this dream of yesteryear take the place of their web show's third season?  Strip Search, coming soon to the PATV video channel, is that dream. The show pits 12 webcomic creators (six guys and six gals) against each other for a $15,000 cash prize and the opportunity to work out of the Penny Arcade offices for a whole year.  We talked with Holkins, Krahulik and Robert Khoo, Penny Arcade's head of business operations, about the experience of making Strip Search, drama on the set and their own favorite reality shows.  How did the concept for a webcomic reality show originate, and what made it possible? Mike: I think the original idea for Strip Search popped up on a very old podcast ... at least five years ago. We came up with the idea for a reality show for webcomics and it just sort of went by the wayside. It wasn't until recently that Robert came back to us and said, ""Hey, were you serious about that? Because we can try it now."" Robert: We were in the middle of planning our Kickstarter campaign from 2012, in which we were looking to remove ads off of Penny Arcade, and then we thought a cool ""stretch goal"" would be actually to do this idea of a reality show based around a webcomic. That, plus us wanting to switch up the format of our own normal reality show.  Were you guys fans of reality TV beforehand? What are your favorite shows? Jerry: I think all people are fans of reality shows. There is a reality show that every person enjoys. You can't really get away from it. This is the kind of television that's being made now.  Mike: I am a huge fan of Kitchen Nightmares. I also enjoy Inkmaster, and I really like Hotel Hell. Really anything with Chef Ramsay I would rate up towards the top. Jerry: I like Master Chef a lot; I like Project Runway, I think that's really great. And have you ever watched RuPaul's Drag Race? It's fucking fascinating!   Robert: My favorite is, without a doubt, Amazing Race. It's interesting, because Amazing Race is what I look for when I'm planning out the Omegathon at PAX ... We've done 12 or 13 of them. What is the format of Strip Search? Robert: It is very traditional in the sense of reality shows. You have 12 artists, the contestants, living in a giant house, and they are, through a structured process, eliminated one by one. That's all we can say. Jerry: It's like Agatha Christie, except everyone is still alive at the end. But there are parallels.  It's not anything that you don't expect as an enthusiast of the genre, I would say. What makes it different is the exact nature of the competition and the fact that we had a real crop of really, really interesting people and we hope to give them plenty of time.  How did you choose contestants? Mike: We did open call on the website. I think we got something like a thousand entries and just whittled down from there until we were left with 12 super talented artists that we were excited to see compete against each other.  Robert: Our hiring process is pretty unique and it's pretty rigorous as far as what we make people go through to work at Penny Arcade. Since one of the prizes for Strip Search was, in fact, to be integrated into the Penny Arcade machine for a full year, all of the contestants essentially went through that same due diligence process that a normal employee would.  Jerry: Writ large. Robert: We had nearly a thousand applicants. We whittled that down round after round, down to like 500, down to 200, down to 50, down to 20, down to 12. Eventually we came up with a group of incredibly talented and, quite frankly, very charismatic people.  Charisma is important if you want them to get along on camera, right? Mike: Well, we didn't necessarily want them to get along in the house. They did. But that was not our intention.  Did you want drama on the show? Mike: It would be fun, yeah. I mean, I wouldn't have minded if somebody had gotten into a fistfight or there had been some sort of rumble in a hot tub. I don't know. None of that actually happened, but it wasn't for lack of trying. Were you surprised that 12 artists could get along in one house? Mike: I was, absolutely. I mean, being an artist myself, I assumed that if you put 12 artists together in a closed space like that, you were sure to get some arguments and some fighting. I certainly would have fought with them. But they all got along really well. And they were friends, which, you know, that was a little disappointing. Robert: To be fair, that's not really true. There is conflict. Don't forget, we have all the interviews, all the one-on-one interviews with everyone, where they actually say their real feelings. It's not all roses. There's definitely conflict. Mike: We never had to call an ambulance to the house. And to me, that's something we need to work on for season two. Jerry: One of the strange things about the process and the house, and the process of making cartoons, or making anything, is that generally speaking, a creative endeavor is very solitary. And other people really don't understand what that's like. Unless you have done it yourself, unless you have committed to turning a blank sheet of paper into something more interesting, there are things about that that you don't understand. And I think that they were all really excited to be in a place where this is actually something that they all understood very well. You're not given many opportunities outside of, you know, Twitter or something like that, but to actually be in a house with other people who understand such a specific personal problem was actually really great, I think, for most of them.  What was your interaction with the housemates like? Mike: Well, Jerry and I had different interaction than Robert did, so I can only say what our part was. We only saw the contestants when it was time to eliminate someone. So after the contest and everything, after all the day's activities were done, they would show up in front of us and we would decide who would go home. Robert: But you would be getting clips and notes throughout the day. Mike: Oh yeah, we had spies everywhere, much like Sauron. We were well-informed of the day's activities. Robert: My interaction with the house was, essentially I was one of the on-site producers. But my actual interaction was to have no interaction with them. Like, I did not speak to them throughout the entire day unless it was especially appropriate for the show, so I was very much part of the crew.  Was it tough not to interact with them? Robert: Yes. I would say that both parties actually really want to interact with one another. Like, I really want to talk to them, because keep in mind: As far as the selection process, 95% of that was me, and so I knew everything about everyone. I knew all their personalities, I knew their Internet history, I knew all the work that they had done and I really wanted to get to know these people, but I could not. And I know that a lot of them wanted to talk to me about Penny Arcade, or about the business side of things, but they could not. So that was challenging, for sure.  Mike and Jerry, what was challenging about judging the contestants? Jerry: I think that judging people is harder than it seems. At least, to their face. It's very easy to watch American Idol or any of these other reality shows and be on your couch judging ... But when the people are in front of you and you can see their lips quivering and their eyes moistening with the prospect of leaving, it makes it tougher. But also sort of more delicious. More savory. Mike: We only got to interact with these people during the most dramatic part of their lives. You had to fuck up in order to get in front of us. They were essentially on our altar, and we had to choose which one to skewer. That was our real job. And that was our only job, every day. Jerry: I learned that I have a taste for blood. But I had to develop it. And it turns out that dashing people's hopes is actually a very tough business if you are the sort of person that has hopes yourself. Like, I know exactly how they feel and what they're up against, trying to lead a creative life. In one hand, I have the life that they want. In the other hand, I have a black sword. And it's hard to have those two things.  Also, right above the space that we did the eliminations was a medical marijuana collective and I don't have a card, so I can't go up there and get any, but a lot of times when we were waiting for the contestants to come, we would have to sit outside in a car for an hour or two, and just seeing people coming in an out of there, with an ounce, two ounces at a time, was hard. That was hard. So would you want to do another season of Strip Search? Mike: I think so. Robert: Our experience was very positive, but what it comes down to is whether or not people want to watch it. I don't want to sound over-dramatic, but I think it was life-changing for everyone involved. Jerry: Yeah, in front of and behind the camera. You know, the reality is — and in this case I'm referring to reality television — the truth of it is that everyone knows about these types of shows. Everyone has seen this type of television program. So everyone understands the sort of tropes that are going on in that kind of entertainment. What was weird was, when you're actually here, being a part of it, you actually can't escape it. It turns out that those tropes have a weird sort of gravity. And things just are occurring to create the maximum drama, without you having to do anything.  That was the weirdest part of the experience for us: actually watching human drama unfold in front of you. We're so geared to look for it by the genre, and we actually had a chance to see it in front of us. It was almost spooky.  Image courtesy of Flickr, Brendan Adkins "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/public-speaking-tips-entrepreneurs/,5 Public Speaking Tips for Entrepreneurs,"For most of us, public speaking can be incredibly nerve-wracking. What if you mess up? What if no one claps? What if someone asks you a question to which you don’t know the answer? What if you throw up on stage? (Seriously, you should at least stop worrying about that one.) But with the right preparation, public speaking doesn’t have to be such a daunting, fretful experience. The chance to strut your stuff and raise awareness for your brand is actually really exciting, especially if you’re a young company looking to introduce your expertise—and offering—to the world. Here are five steps to take before you get up on that stage to make sure you most genuinely connect with your audience, get your point across in the time allotted, and (most importantly) don’t pass out.
 The benefits of this old adage are twofold. First, becoming comfortable with the material you’ll be delivering will ease your nerves—after reading your speech to your mom, grandma and six closest friends, the experience will feel much less intimidating. Second, you’ll significantly improve your delivery. Audiences want to connect with the people they’re watching speak or present, and if you’re reading from a piece of paper for 20 minutes, they’re not going to have the opportunity to do so. The more you know your stuff, the more you’ll be able to make eye contact, throw in a joke and ensure you pack in all of your crucial points before the buzzer.
 If you have the opportunity to do so—like at a conference or cocktail party—check out where you’re going to be speaking. Are you using a microphone? Do you have any AV requirements? The better you understand your surroundings, the more you can concentrate on the public speaking itself. And if you’re incorporating AV aspects into your presentation, back to #1 you go.
 It's important to know your audience across all of the various ways you communicate. But this sentiment is arguably most important when it comes to communicating in person. Your No. 1 goal for any public speaking opportunity is to really connect with your audience. Regardless of how well you address the topic at hand, if people don’t get it, it won’t resonate. And if you’re not getting your message across, what’s the point? Research the event and check in with the coordinators beforehand so you know who to expect, and then tailor your comments accordingly. For example, think about explaining the current social media landscape to a room full of senior citizens versus a room full college students. Different speech, right? (Answer: Yes.) Another aspect to consider, thanks to our ever-evolving digital world, is any virtual audience that might be participating in the event. Is your presentation being live streamed? Live tweeted? It’s just as important to understand this community. Ask what platforms will be pushing out the content—like the event’s Facebook page—so you can further amend your speech to address this audience. And, as the technology behind this can get complicated (especially if you’re planning to engage with your digital audience in real-time!), apply the first two tips solely to this aspect prior to getting on that stage.
 If you’ve founded a content production business, and you’re speaking at a Content Production 101 workshop, it makes a lot of sense for you to talk about your company and your experience in the industry. But many times, the connection between what you do and what you’re speaking about isn’t so straightforward. And in these cases, remember that while you want to use the speaking opportunity to draw attention to your business. You also don’t want to come across as too salesy. So how do you find the balance? Remember that you represent your brand, so if you give a kick-ass speech, people are going to want to know more about you. As long as there’s an easy place for them to find you and to learn about what you do (a.k.a., make sure your company’s name, website and Twitter handle is in your slides or the event’s program), the connection will be made naturally—no awkward, forced interjections of your brand into your speech required. That said, it’s also OK to find one or two places to seamlessly (and genuinely) tie together what you do and the topic you’re discussing as you’re crafting your remarks. Finally, make sure to network at the event. One of the biggest benefits of public speaking is the opportunity to position yourself as an expert, so make yourself available for questions and meet-and-greets both before and after your speech so you can strut your stuff.
 Really, don’t forget to breathe. You’ll be great! Photo courtesy of Flickr, Adam Tinworth

http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/samsung-beefs-up-chromebox-with-a-core-i5-processor/,Samsung Beefs Up Chromebox With a Core i5 Processor,"Chromebox, Samsung's Chrome OS-based mini PC, has been criticized for not packing enough power for its price. Now, it looks like Samsung is responding with a new version of Chromebox that has a much faster processor.  Instead of the lowly Celeron processor, the new Chromebox has a 2.5GHz dual-core Intel i5 processor. Its other specifications are identical to the old model: 4GB of memory and a 16GB SSD. The device, named XE300M22-A01US, is available through multiple retailers.  Price-wise, the Chromebox has gone up a little. The latest version costs upwards of $405, depending on the retailer, whereas its predecessor retails for $329.  While we welcome this increase in processing power, the fact that it comes with a significantly higher price tag makes us wonder whether the new Chromebox is worth purchasing.  Would you buy it?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/sisters-viral-facebook-puppy/,Sisters' Viral Facebook Campaign Gains a Million Likes — and a Puppy,"Score another victory for social media.  Spurred on by a skeptical father, a pair of sisters posted the image, above, to Facebook on Tuesday. They asked other users to like the photo, and make their dad follow through on his promise of a new puppy if the shot received a million digital thumbs-up.  Less than seven hours later, the girls had their wish.  ""Hi World,"" reads the message written in marker on a piece of butcher paper. ""We want a puppy! Our dad said we could get one if we get 1 million likes! He doesn't think we can do it! So 'LIKE' this!"" On the Facebook page, entitled Twogirlsandapuppy, the girls write that their previous dog died of cancer last year. Inspired by another pair of siblings who had tried a similar stunt, they asked their dad to agree to a bet of sorts.  Posts by different family members over the course of the day tell the story of a simple bet gone viral. In one, a family member says ""the girls were giddy"" as they watched the likes pile up, but didn't hint that the goal was within immediate reach. In another, the father promises that he'll be true to his word should the photo indeed reach 1 million likes.  Finally, the milestone was achieved in a post about six hours after the page was first set up: Everyone pointing out that the profile pic has 700,000+ likes and that that other pic has 300,000+, we've just realized that. So wow—they will wake up to find they've already reached their goal! Amazing. Dad has a long day of work tomorrow but it seems we'll be looking before the week's out. We will post a picture here in thanks!
 An hour later, the profile picture had 1.2 million likes, so it's likely that the family will soon be visiting shelters to look for a new addition. The sisters will gain a puppy, and parents everywhere will learn an important lesson: Never doubt the power of social media, a couple of adorable sisters and, of course, puppies.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/taylor-penning-star-wars-book/,Mashable Editor Penning Star Wars Book,"Mashable Deputy Editor Chris Taylor is about to use his considerable writing talents — and maybe a wee bit of The Force — to write the book the Star Wars oeuvre has been missing: How Star Wars Conquered the Universe. A look at the business and culture of this iconic film series, the book will boldly go where no Star Wars tome has gone before (oops, wrong sci-fi reference). Chris’ book (his first) will offer a fresh perspective on how Star Wars became one of the most talked about franchises and brands in history. Chris has already written extensively about Star Wars on Mashable, most recently covering the Obama Administration's response to a petition requesting the U.S. Government build a real Death Star. Here’s how Chris describes his new project: I'm thrilled to be writing How Star Wars Conquered the Universe, the first book to examine the entire Star Wars brand from a business/culture perspective. As Disney takes control of the franchise and prepares to release Episode VII in 2015, there's never been a more important time to consider exactly what made this epic great in the first place. Its past offers a lot of clues to why it has a robust future in the post-Lucas era, given how much of it was a team effort from the very beginning. I want to give proper credit to all the other talented writers, technicians, artists and game-makers who built the Expanded Universe and helped it thrive. It's a daunting prospect, trying to do justice to a modern legend that has mesmerized every generation since 1977, but I can't imagine a more engrossing research project. This book will be more fun than a barrel full of Banthas. Keep watching Mashable for book updates, exclusive excerpts and more as Chris races to finish the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs. How Star Wars Conquered the Universe will be released by Basic Books in early 2014. Mashable composite. Photo via NASA and Flickr, avdesign. "

Imangi Studios had been completely silent on Temple Run 2, but Touch Arcade downloaded a copy as soon as it went live there. According to game screenshots, the endless runner builds on the same formula that brought success to Temple Run, setting players to flee from a giant monkey in an ancient temple. Temple Run was released in 2011 first for iOS, then ported to Google Play and Amazon's App Store in 2012. It has been downloaded more than 170 million times by players around the world. In summer of 2012, Imangi Studios partnered with Disney to release Temple Run: Brave as a tie-in for the Disney-Pixar release.  Temple Run will be available in the U.S. App Store at midnight on Thursday. There's no word on a version for Android. Come back tomorrow to read an interview with Temple Run developer Keith Shepherd of Imangi Studios, as well as additional information about the game. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/16/the-death-star-strikes-back/,The Death Star Strikes Back After White House Snub,"Having refused to build a moon-sized battle station in space — and worse, invoking the power of the Force without so much as a nod to the Dark Side — the Obama administration should have expected some mockery at the hands of the Galactic Empire. It got that Tuesday, in the form of an unusual press release on the official Star Wars website. Datelined ""Imperial City, Couruscant,"" the post crows about the ""overwhelming superiority"" of Imperial forces over the United States.  The post quotes one Governor Wilhuff Tarkin (not yet promoted to Grand Moff): ""Such destructive power can only be wielded to protect and defend by so enlightened a leader as Emperor Palpatine.” Tarkin wouldn't confirm rumors that the Imperials themselves are constructing a Death Star of their own, though Admiral Conan Motti (not yet the guy who was force-choked by Darth Vader) warned the Senate not to believe the petition response's ""exaggerated claims"" of a weakness in the Death Star design, ""should one ever be built."" Motti also took issue with a claim in the White House petition, based on calculations by economics students at LeHigh University, that the Death Star would cost $852 quadrillion (or 13,000 times global GDP). The estimate was based on the market price of steel. “The costs of construction they cited were ridiculously overestimated, though I suppose we must keep in mind that this miniscule planet does not have our massive means of production,"" wrote Motti. The White House could not be reached for comment. But there were one or two fans in the comments section of the blog eager to point out that since the movie took place ""a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,"" Tarkin and Obama are not actually contemporaries. Thanks for the fact check, guys. Image credit: Mashable composite. Photos courtesy NASA and Flickr, mentalnoise "

The Creators Project is launching a series of three new apps that transform your Facebook persona into 3D printable art. By looking at your Facebook interests, Likes, relationships and status updates, the apps — called Monster Me, Crystallized and Astroverb — create an abstract sculpture that embodies your online presence. The project, which is done in collaboration with VICE and Intel, features an app which takes your profile page and morphs it into a real-life mini monster, while another crystalizes your friends network and the other cranks out a personalized zodiac sign based on your online personality. Although the apps are free, the cost of printing a figurine is about $15. ""We wanted to play with the idea of taking your virtual self and bringing it back into the physical,"" Julia Kaganskiy of The Creators Project told Mashable. ""We wanted it to be playful, fun and creative and brought on a varied group of our creators to develop unique artistic experiences using the data Facebook makes available."" Each app creates a 3D sculpture, which is printed by Shapeways, through layers of materials such as sandstone and stainless steel. It takes about five minutes to go through the creation and profile analysis process via the apps. SEE ALSO: 5 Sites to Score 3D-Printed Gifts
 The Monster Me app by design studio Sticky Monster Lab uses your birthday to determine the monster's shape, geographic location to determine the environment and the number of friends in your network to decide how many mini friends your monster has within the app. It also looks at interests and Likes to determine the buildings in your personal ""cityscape.""  Meanwhile, the Crystallized app — developed by SOFTlab — visualizes social relationships and designs a crystal 3D structure to reflect that network. Each point on the geode represents a friend and its distance from the center is determined by the strength of your relationship, ranging from mutual friends to interactions on Facebook. ""The interior represents your friend's interests and Likes as crystal clusters,"" the company said.  In addition, the Astroverb app by Sosolimited looks at status updates and searches for keywords that fall into one of its six ""personality dimensions."" It ranks your profile based on how you score for each dimension and uses that information to construct a personalized horoscope and zodiac symbol. ""We're really excited about 3D printing right now and wanted to create a really easy way for people to try it for themselves,"" Kaganskiy said.

For that matter, turn off the tablet and the laptop too. Researchers in New Zealand found kids who had difficulty falling asleep at night were exposed to more screen time within 90 minutes of bed than those with earlier sleep onset.  The study, published in the Journal Pediatrics, called ""Presleep Activities and Time of Sleep Onset in Children"" looked at the behavior of over 2,000 children. It examined the association between how much TV the kids watched and how long it took them to fall asleep.  Researchers concluded those ""participants with a later sleep onset had significantly greater engagement in screen time than those with an earlier sleep onset."" SEE ALSO: Screen Time Before Bed May Be Keeping You Awake This isn't the first time we've heard how screen time can keep you awake at night. A few months ago we reported on a study out of the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute which found two or more hours of exposure to backlit devices suppresses melatonin by as much as 22%. That suppression, especially in teenagers, can lead to problems getting to sleep at night. While the New Zealand study looked at younger children and adolescents, you can see the pattern here. Screen time of any kind, whether TV, smartphone or tablet can disrupt your ability to sleep, no matter your age.  So what can you do to settle your kids before bed?

Facebook and Google have already planted their flag by setting up offices in the country — and now Twitter is joining the fray by opening an office in Sao Paulo, the country's largest city, according to Reuters. ""We believe our new office in Brazil will allow us to get closer to the users and show the value of our platform,"" Twitter's country manager for Brazil, Guilherme Ribenboim, told Reuters. ""Brazil has rather mature Internet and advertisement markets. Our audience is very big and active. We are going to try to monetize it."" The move is highly tactical: many Brazilians have been switching from Orkut, which was hugely popular, to more modern social networks popular elsewhere in the world. However, Facebook has been taking a larger slice of the social pie than competitor Twitter. By putting an office in the heart of Brazil, Twitter is likely hoping to convince those abandoning Orkut to focus their social energy on Twitter over Facebook.

 Twitter is also aiming to bolster the network's popularity before two major events sure to be watched and tweeted about by millions the world over: the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games. Last year's Olympic Games in London generated 150 million tweets. ""The World Cup and the Olympic Games offer huge opportunities to leverage and show the potential of Twitter,"" Ribenboim told Reuters. 89 million — slightly less than half — of Brazilians are online, giving the country a ranking of fifth overall in terms of web access.

The threshold was previously set at 25,000 signatures, and prior to that, the minimum number was 5,000, according to the post. ""We're making another adjustment to ensure we're able to continue to give the most popular ideas the time they deserve,"" said Macon Phillips, the White House's director of digital strategy. The new limit only applies to petitions created after the announcement, and won't be retroactively applied to those that already exist, Phillips added.

'Workaholics' Before They Were Stars,"Season four of the Comedy Central hit Workaholics premieres Wednesday night, marking the return of ne'er-do-wells Adam, Blake and Ders to college living rooms across the country.  The sitcom follows the three twenty-somethings as they party, get into mischief and generally screw off at their lame telemarketing job in Southern California. Its offbeat humor, clever dialogue and irreverent take on post-grad life have made Workaholics a cult favorite beyond just the college set, and an AMA the co-stars did on Tuesday was up-voted to Reddit's top spot.  Comedy Central has posted more than 50 Workaholics clips to YouTube, but the trio likely would have never made it to TV in the first place if not for the video sharing network.  Comedy Central picked up the show in 2010 based on the humor and popularity of Adam DeVine, Blake Anderson and Anders Holm's YouTube channel Mail Order Comedy and their online series 5th Year. The rest, as they say, is history — but their path from web to broadcast reflects an increasingly common method of making it big and the wider range of possibilities facilitated by the social web.  ""The way this show evolved from a 5th Year and Mail Order Comedy webisode concept into a Comedy Central series is an example of how creative talent can use these two complimentary media platforms,” David Pritchard, head of the production company Gigapix Studios, said in a press release when Workaholics was picked up.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/aaron-swartz-prosecutor-ortiz/,Aaron Swartz's Prosecutor: I Wasn't Seeking Maximum Sentence,"U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, the leading prosecutor in the case against the late hacker and activist Aaron Swartz, said in a statement released late Wednesday that she would have recommended to the judge a prison sentence of six months, not the maximum sentence of 35 years Swartz potentially faced under charges of computer fraud and other crimes. Ortiz has been heavily criticized since Swartz took his own life on January 11th. Some commentators and Swartz's family believe the threat of jail time and what they consider Ortiz's prosecutorial overreach were contributing factors in Swartz's decision.  Ortiz, however, insists her office's conduct in the case was ""appropriate"" given the crime. ""The prosecutors recognized that there was no evidence against Mr. Swartz indicating that he committed his acts for personal financial gain, and they recognized that his conduct — while a violation of the law — did not warrant the severe punishments authorized by Congress and called for by the Sentencing Guidelines in appropriate cases,"" said Ortiz in her statement. ""That is why in the discussions with his counsel about a resolution of the case this office sought an appropriate sentence that matched the alleged conduct — a sentence that we would recommend to the judge of six months in a low security setting."" ""At no time did this office ever seek — or ever tell Mr. Swartz's attorneys that it intended to seek — maximum penalties under the law,"" she added.  A reports this week from the Wall Street Journal suggested that Ortiz's office offered Swartz' lawyers a plea deal which was rejected because the government was insisting on some amount of jail time, reportedly six to eight months. Ortiz, in her statement, acknowledged that Swartz's defense ""would have been free to recommend a sentence of probation,"" which, if approved by a judge, may have kept Swartz out of jail with the understanding that a repeat incident would likely put him behind bars. ""Ultimately, any sentence imposed would have been up to the judge,"" wrote Ortiz. SEE ALSO: After Aaron Swartz: The Tech World Must Talk About Depression
 A White House petition to remove Ortiz for her approach to Swartz' case has more than 40,000 signatures, enough to prompt an official response. Darrell Issa, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, is investigating Ortiz and the Department of Justice's handling of the case. Swartz was arrested in 2011 after sneaking into a Massachusetts Institute of Technology network closet, connecting a laptop and using a program to rapidly download a large amount of academic research. His trial was expected to begin in the spring, but the charges against him have since been dropped — standard procedure when a defendant dies. Ortiz's full statement:
 January 16, 2013 STATEMENT OF UNITED STATES ATTORNEY CARMEN M. ORTIZ REGARDING THE DEATH OF AARON SWARTZ As a parent and a sister, I can only imagine the pain felt by the family and friends of Aaron Swartz, and I want to extend my heartfelt sympathy to everyone who knew and loved this young man. I know that there is little I can say to abate the anger felt by those who believe that this officeâ€™s prosecution of Mr. Swartz was unwarranted and somehow led to the tragic result of him taking his own life. I must, however, make clear that this officeâ€™s conduct was appropriate in bringing and handling this case. The career prosecutors handling this matter took on the difficult task of enforcing a law they had taken an oath to uphold, and did so reasonably. The prosecutors recognized that there was no evidence against Mr. Swartz indicating that he committed his acts for personal financial gain, and they recognized that his conduct - while a violation of the law - did not warrant the severe punishments authorized by Congress and called for by the Sentencing Guidelines in appropriate cases. That is why in the discussions with his counsel about a resolution of the case this office sought an appropriate sentence that matched the alleged conduct - a sentence that we would recommend to the judge of six months in a low security setting. While at the same time, his defense counsel would have been free to recommend a sentence of probation. Ultimately, any sentence imposed would have been up to the judge. At no time did this office ever seek - or ever tell Mr. Swartzâ€™s attorneys that it intended to seek - maximum penalties under the law. As federal prosecutors, our mission includes protecting the use of computers and the Internet by enforcing the law as fairly and responsibly as possible. We strive to do our best to fulfill this mission every day. Photo courtesy of Flickr, joi "

Triple that dread if you're a child-turned-banshee once a needle comes into the picture.  There's an app for that, and just in time for flu season. Healthline Networks launched a ""Big Shots Get Shots"" campaign to help children overcome their needle fear, or trypanophobia.  Along with a free iPhone app to distract little ones on the examining table, the campaign encourages parents to take an online pledge to end needle phobia. The pledge is designed to be shared on social networks to spread awareness on what doctors say is a life-threatening aversion.  ""Big Shots Get Shots"" takes users on a journey with Pablo the Pufferfish, who's afraid of his own needles. Serving as an interactive storybook, the app distracts children with cute sea creatures,  Jigsaw puzzles and drag and drop games.  SEE ALSO: App Game for Kids Encourages Healthy Eating
 So while your eyes may widen at that syringe (an estimated 50 million Americans are afraid of shots), your child will be too busy watching Pablo learn how needles protect. Watch the app demo here.  Kids today get more shots than previous generations, needle phobia expert Dr. Amy Baxter says in a Healthline press release. Early fear of needles leads to people not completing their immunizations, and carries on to adulthood. That's where technology comes in handy.  ""Another approach is to let the child choose a distraction, like seek and find games or a favorite iPad app,"" Baxter says on the site. ""The more sensations you can involve, the better.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/apple-china-2-year-plan/,Apple Lets Online Buyers in China Pay in Two-Year Installments,"Apple started offering installment payment plans in its China web shop, letting buyers pay for iPhones, iPads and Macbooks over the course of 2 years, Bloomberg reported.  The deal is valid for owners of China Merchants Bank credit cards and for purchases ranging from 300 yuan ($48) to 30,000 yuan ($4,800). Buyers can split payments into three, six, 12, 18 or 24 installments, with additional fees being applied for the last two options.  With this move, Apple hopes to tap into the mid-range consumer market in China, where an iPhone — which costs 5,288 yuan ($850) — is still out of the price range of the average customer. An urban worker in China has an average monthly pay of about 3,585 yuan ($577), according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics.  IDC now places Apple sixth in China's smartphone market (down from fourth place in the quarter before that), behind Samsung, Coolpad, Lenovo, ZTE and Huawei.  Image courtesy of Flickr, yum9me "

Today, we're looking at three particularly interesting stories. AT&T Reportedly Looking to Expand to Europe AT&T is considering expansion to Europe, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing ""people familiar with the carrier's thinking."" The company is looking into potential acquisitions on the old continent. If such a deal comes through, it could happen before the end of 2013, the WSJ claimed. Targets include Dutch company Royal KPN NV and the UK's Everything Everywhere, but AT&T also wouldn't mind settling in Germany, the report added.  Dutch Court Rules Samsung's Tablets Do Not Infringe on Apple's Design A Dutch court has ruled that Samsung's tablets do not infringe on Apple's design, Reuters reported. It's another victory for the Korean electronic giant in a seemingly never-ending patent dispute. Last July, a UK court ruled that Samsung didn't copy the iPad, but in the following month, a U.S. court awarded Apple $1 billion in damages after a similar trial.  ""We continue to believe that Apple was not the first to design a tablet with a rectangular shape and rounded corners and that the origins of Apple's registered design features can be found in numerous examples,"" Samsung said in a statement. Asus Wants to Make a Windows Phone 8 Smartphone or Padfone Asus has expressed interest in making a Windows Phone 8-based smartphone or Padfone, the company's trademarked combination of a smartphone and a tablet, the Wall Street Journal reported.  ""With our Padfone concept, the phone plus tablet, I think it makes sense for Windows 8,"" said Benson Lin, the company's vice-president. We're not sure how a WP8-based Padfone would work, since the operating system is a bit restrictive when it comes to screen size, but Microsoft certainly wouldn't mind seeing one, especially after HTC reportedly gave up on plans to make a large-screen WP device.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/asius-inflatable-earbuds/,Inflatable Earbuds Aim for Apple Debut,"An earpiece that inflates like a tiny airbag inside human ears can create the perfect fit for any music-listening experience or hearing aid. The futuristic twist on earbuds could even arrive in Apple stores sometime in the near future. The inflatable earpieces represent the newest invention of Stephen Ambrose, a pioneer in audio technology and founder of Asius Technologies. His technology aims to deliver better sound for consumer earbuds, hearing aids and the in-ear monitors used by performing artists, but without the collateral hearing damage caused by cranking up the volume to compensate for imperfect listening devices. ""We went to Apple, and they said we have the holy grail of in-ear devices and they just can't wait for us to be in their store,"" Ambrose said. Asius earned early rave reviews from people with hearing loss during a study funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. Electronics industry representatives and journalists also had a chance to try out the earpieces during the International CES in Las Vegas last week. The inflated earpieces create an oddly comfortable feeling inside the ear that resembles the slight change in air pressure when riding an elevator, according to one CES attendee. In a clever twist, the earpieces can harness the sound pressure from the headphone or hearing aid speakers to inflate themselves. ""You don't have to slide it into the ear because it actually crawls into the ear canal and unfurls,"" Ambrose told TechNewsDaily. Such inflatable earpieces can create an ""isolation"" seal in the ear that blocks outside noise, but remain flexible enough to absorb some of the excess sound pressure pumped into the ear by headphone or hearing aid speakers. Excess sound pressure can ""beat up"" the eardrum and trigger an acoustic reflex that defensively dampens loud sounds — often leading headphone users to crank up the volume even more in a vicious cycle. The Asius technology can also reduce the ""occlusion effect"" that creates the booming, resonant sound of having your ears plugged. But the earpieces required flexible, yet strong, material that could withstand being inflated and deflated countless times. Asius looked around at several custom and commercial materials before settling upon medical-grade ePTFE material (Gore-Tex), said Samuel Gido, vice president for materials technology at Asius Technologies and a polymer engineer at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. The Asius earpieces could eliminate the need for custom-fit earpieces used by professional hearing aids and expensive custom headphones, Gido said. Custom-fit molding currently relies upon an uncomfortable and imperfect ""ear impression"" process of pouring silicone ""goop"" into a person's ears to create a mold of their ear canals.  SEE ALSO: 3D Ear Scanning Enables Custom-Fit Headphones
 Inflatable earpieces could also prove more flexible in adjusting to the changing shape of human ear canals as people yawn, chew and talk. Human ear canals even change their shape as people get older. ""This device gives you an excellent seal as good as a custom mold, but you don't need the custom molding,"" Gido explained. Audio device manufacturers such as Apple, Sony and Sennheiser have already begun discussing how to use the Asius earpiece technology. Ambrose has even successfully retrofitted existing commercial earpieces, such as an $800 pair of in-ear headphones owned by his wife, Garnet Ambrose. (They originally didn't sound much better than a cheaper pair of headphones.) Garnet Ambrose has spent hours peering into microscopes to work on the Asius earpiece prototypes and retrofits by hand. She recalled her earlier days working with musicians such as Nick Mason, the drummer of Pink Floyd, as she demonstrated the inflatable earpieces to CES attendees crowding around the booth. ""I wore this all day while I was cooking, cleaning, and doing all my normal things,"" Garnet Ambrose said. ""The only thing I was disappointed in was that I ran out of music and had to download more."" The early prototype earpiece she held in her hands looked like two inflatable bags dangling from the ends of headphone cords — a cruder version of the final product consumers can expect. Yet the prototype had survived constant inflation and deflation during demonstrations over the past two years. Maybe durability from a soft, flexible material should not come as a surprise. After all, Gore-Tex has become a material of choice for surgeons repairing hernias and heart defects. The stuff is made for heavy lifting, right? ""You got it,"" Garnet Ambrose said. In the background, her husband echoed the same words in a completely different conversation. ""You got it!"" Photo courtesy of Jeremy Hsu | TechMediaNetwork

""It's made cooking a lot more accessible to everyone, and it's made everyone a lot more creative at home,"" celebrity chef Bobby Flay tells Mashable. ""When you click on Instagram people are posting what they're cooking, eating, ingredients in markets and complaints."" Flay is among the famous faces of the cooking world who are taking the healthy-living mantras they popularized on TV and transforming them in digestible — and sharable — nuggets online. This week, for example, Flay launched Bobby Flay Fit. It's a seven-episode series in which he serves up recipes, workouts, tips and guests to help you nix unhealthy behaviors.  Each short episode has a theme: Moderation, Motivation, Mix-It-Up, Expect More, Discipline, Support and Wrap-Up.  ""You can watch the whole series in 21 minutes, and it's entertaining at the same time."" ""The subject matter is hard to talk about for a long period of time,"" Flay admits.  The series' website, housed on Food Network's online hub, also features small portions of non-video content that all follow Flay's philosophy that it only takes one week to create healthier habits with moderation and exercise. Flay, whose two TV shows (Brunch @ Bobby's on the Cooking Channel and Bobby's Dinner Battle) premiered this month, lives by the advice he offers in the Fit series.  ""When I go to a restaurant, I used to clean my plate, but now I eat only three-fourths of my plate if I'm full,"" Flay says. ""If I don't like it, I don't eat it. Sometimes people just eat to eat.""  Episode one, for example, highlights his moderation tips — the ones he follows daily. Food Network describes each themed episode as such:  Moderation: ""Learn the secrets to staying fit and healthy every day with chef and restaurateur Bobby Flay. Bobby talks simple tips to keeping active within a busy work day as he walks to work in New York, and explains his key to being able to enjoy all his favorite foods.  He and his assistant chef treat his staff to a healthful lunch of chickpea salad and crab pasta with parsley, mint and dill at the Bobby Flay offices."" Motivation: ""Get inspired to keep up that workout routine and stay energized throughout the day.  Join Bobby on his morning workout routine as he shares what inspired him to lose weight and keep it off. He divulges his secret ingredient to fitness and leading a healthy lifestyle all year long.  Bobby gets a little extra motivation from his trainer who reveals his own secret to fitness success — stretching. Bobby creates a recipe for a tasty and filling tea smoothie with Greek yogurt and berries to keep energy levels high after a great workout."" Mix-It-Up: ""Get more out of your workouts. Bobby ditches his old routine and joins his good friend and avid weight-lifter, Iron Chef Michael Symon for a new, challenging workout. Bobby shows how to keep energy up and hunger away with a yummy nutritious snack of coconut chocolate granola.  Bobby shares his tips to keeping energy and motivation up both during and after a workout."" Expect More: ""Variety is the spice of life when it comes to workout routines.  Bobby tries a brand new way to stay fit: spinning. Bobby's wife Stephanie March introduces him to SoulCycle and they push each other to the limit at this challenging full-body low-impact workout. Bobby and his friends share how they stay motivated to keep fit year round.  Bobby and his friend Katie Lee reward themselves by cooking a delicious brunch after class of oatmeal pancakes and open-faced eggs Florentine sandwiches, including a well-deserved sangria with Pisco and hibiscus tea."" Discipline: ""Bobby talks all about discipline and how he makes time to eat right and exercise, even with his hectic schedule. He visits one of his restaurants, Bar Americain, and discusses the challenges of staying focused on making healthy choices when there are temptations all around. Bobby reveals his tips on keeping meals healthy and delicious every day at home and in his restaurants while still being conscious of how tasting food in all of his restaurants can add up for him. He shares his secrets on how to make food vibrantly flavorful without adding calories by whipping up a light fish dish with a citrus relish packed with flavor, but not fat."" Support: ""Bobby emphasizes the importance of having a workout buddy and keeping fitness fun. One of Bobby's good friends, Michael Symon, joins him in the gym for a kettle bell workout and some friendly racing competition. Not only do they get the work done in the gym, but they do it with a smile. After their workout, the two chefs refuel with a protein-packed, Greek-inspired meal including lamb and quinoa."" Wrap-Up: ""Bobby recaps all of the great tips he has learned to staying fit including how to get motivated, eat healthy, make conscious choices while still having fun and mixing it up. Emphasizing the importance of balance and dedication, Bobby shares his tricks and techniques to leading a healthy lifestyle and hopes he can use his experiences to inspire others to have success in eating right and exercising year-round.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/breastfeeding-app-moms-track-feedings/,SmallNest App Helps Parents Keep Track of Breastfeeding,"Being a new parent is challenging enough with the lack of sleep and caring for a little one around the clock. And for many mothers, breastfeeding doesn't always come easily. A new app aims to make that a bit easier by helping tired new moms track and record when they've breastfeed their baby.  SmallNest is an iOS app that lets moms record how long their babies nurse and how often. This is important because for a baby to get enough calories and for a mom to establish her milk supply, it's typically recommended that she breastfeed at least eight to 12 times in a 24-hour period. With the app, moms can track this information — convenient when days and nights blur together for new parents. And for non-breastfeeding parents, they see when mom last breastfed, get to know the baby's pattern, know when it's time for another feeding.   With SmallNest parents can also track diaper changes and baby's sleep patterns.  The app requires to you login through Facebook but says it won't post to Facebook on your behalf. The company however did send Mashable stats on how many mothers breastfeed and how often, according to information gleaned from the app.  SmallNest says the app has tracked 2,000 babies, primarily in the U.S. and Canada, to gather data about feedings. The average number of feedings for a newborn is 16-18 times per day. However, some moms are breastfeeding 30 or 40 times each day — for up to a year and in some cases beyond. From data from 180,000 feedings entered into the app, SmallNest was able to see moms use the right breast most often.  Alex Shartsis, founder of SmallNest, tells Mashable ""Like most apps and websites, moms using SmallNest agree to our privacy policy, which allows use of anonymous aggregated data. As the volume of data grows, SmallNest's aim is to give insights back to the community so moms can learn and achieve better breastfeeding outcomes: even just knowing you're within a normal range can be really helpful in relieving anxiety and worry,"" he says. ""Of course, knowing things aren't normal is even more useful, as you can seek professional help. America has a long way to go before it's back to a healthy level of breastfeeding. Hopefully information like this can help get us there."" Shartsis says with regard to the right breast/left breast data they only looked at ""feeding occurrences across the entire population as a giant sum and average, so there wasn't even really anything to anonymize.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/company-reviews-factual/,Should You Believe Company Reviews?,"When you need help picking out a new book, gadget, hairstylist or even doctor, what do you do?  Turn to online reviews, of course. Almost all online retailers, from Amazon to individual retail e-boutiques, provide a way for customers to review their products and services. And we, as consumers, scour these reviews to guarantee we're making the perfect choice. So it should be no surprise that there are company review sites, like Glassdoor.com and Jobitorial.com, that provide a window-shopping experience for the modern jobseeker. You can see reviews and information (like average salaries) from current and former employees — all designed to help you gauge the overall company experience. But how do these sites fit in to your job hunt? Should you take them as absolute truth, or with a grain of salt? Before you go down the rabbit hole of online reviews, here are some guidelines for effectively incorporating them into your job search — and your ultimate employment decisions. When you're searching for a job, it's tempting to look at online reviews right away — or even use them as a way to find the best places to work. And yeah, while glowing reviews may encourage you to look closer at a company, bad ones can seriously hinder your motivation to submit an application — even if you would otherwise be very interested in the job (and even if said reviews turn out to be off the mark). To avoid that bias, hold off on reading reviews until you snag an interview. Check out companies' websites, job descriptions, social media platforms and current news-based research. (Did they just release a new app? Make an appearance on the Today Show?) You should be excited about what the company does at its core — not just how cool its office is or how much (or little) its employees get paid. Then, once your resume and cover letter are sent, and you've (hopefully) booked an interview, browse away. On average, a happy customer will tell three people about her great experience, while an unhappy one will tell more than three times that. OK, so you're not looking up product reviews or restaurant recommendations, but the same logic can be applied here. Keep in mind that an unsatisfied employee (or ex-employee), is more likely to actively look for a place to vent his frustrations about his company than a happy employee looking to sing its praises, and for that reason, many online review sites skew negatively. This doesn't mean you should discredit all the reviews; in fact, a series of bad reviews that bring up the same general themes can certainly be a reflection of an undesirable company. But realize that every company has a few dissatisfied employees — even consistently top-rated places to work, like Google — so consider everything you're reading with a critical eye. Also, put yourself in the company's position. Do the reviews complain about layoffs, cuts in PTO or recent changes in management?  On one hand, that could be a red flag to indicate a company's downward spiral. But if you investigate further, you may find out that the business is restructuring or has been recently acquired, and these changes may be a normal and healthy part of revitalizing a once-struggling company or resetting its course. Or, as you dig deeper, you might learn that employees' grumbling about ""cuts to vacation"" are due to the former ""unlimited vacation"" policy being switched to three weeks, which is hardly the same as the company scrimping on vacation days. Don't just take what you read at face value. If you're concerned about something, do additional research to get the facts. OK, so you've combed through all 74 reviews about your company of choice, and you've noticed a few key issues that come up again and again. Now what? The best thing to do with this information is to pinpoint things you want to address during the interview process, whether by observing whatâ€™s going on around you or by directly asking your interviewer. First, determine the things that you might be able to get a straightforward, factual answer to. For example, if a review stated, ""Everyone here is worked to the bone,"" you could easily ask a question about the length of a typical workday.  On the other hand, if a review that insisted, ""All of my managers have terrible leadership skills,"" that's admittedly a bit trickier. Unfortunately, there's no truly objective way to verify this information, and you'll have to keep an eye out for other signs that will help you discern whether or not you should be concerned. Now, when you do ask for information, make sure your tone is purely inquisitive and never accusatory. Even if you read about a company's flat management structure and infrequent promotions, it won't translate well if you hit your interviewer with, ""So, would I really be in the same position for at least five years?""  Instead, stick with a simple, ""Can you tell me about the path to move up to a management position, and the typical time frame for that?"" The hiring manager can easily provide a factual answer to this, without feeling attacked. All is said and done, and your interviewer verified what all the reviews mentioned: long hours and no overtime. But, after a few short years, you'll be in a great position to land your dream job. Could the long hours be worth it? Or, maybe you're in the opposite scenario — while all the reviews say that the company culture makes up for the lack of promotions, you've been dead set on climbing the ladder quickly, and the situation you've uncovered has given you pause. Remember that the issues that are complaint-worthy (or praise-worthy) to one employee may not affect you in the same way. Instead of grouping the reviews you read into ""good"" versus ""bad,"" evaluate the issues individually and decide what they mean to you. Also, while it's easy to get caught up in online reviews, your overall opinion of the company should come from a much wider array of sources. For one, go offline, and see if you can get more personal information from a current or former employee.  Beyond research, the things you observe within the company (are employees smiling? Is everyone hiding in their cubicle?), your interaction with the hiring manager and your enthusiasm for the company's core purpose should all influence your ultimate decision. Don't be afraid to trust your (well-informed) gut. It's usually right. Image courtesy of Flickr, Mike Licht, NotionsCapital.com

The creators behind the popular webcomic announced that they walked away from a potential deal with a cable network to turn their webcomic into a television show, MediaBistro reports. Kris Wilson told readers that he and the other Cyanide & Happiness creators had been approached about a TV show twice before, but walked away ""due to rights and creative control issues."" ""We're starting to realize that TV as an industry just isn't compatible with what we want to do with our animation: deliver it conveniently to a global audience, something we've been doing all along with our comics these past years,"" Wilson wrote. ""That's just the nature of television versus the Internet, I suppose."" The third and latest deal fell through for similar reasons. Other YouTube channels have made the leap from the Internet to the small screen. Pop culture commentator KalebNation got his own deal for a show in October 2011, and Nickelodeon gave Fred Figglehorn his own show, and he starred in two made-for-TV-movies for the network.  Epic Meal Time shot a TV pilot for G4 earlier last year, and a TV version of the Annoying Orange now airs on Cartoon Network. The sisters who commentated on Ray J's junk in the Kim Kardashian sex tape also got a one-hour special from OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network. However, Wilson and company still want to bring a Cyanide & Happiness Show to the web. The creators plan to launch a Kickstarter campaign to raise money for production. Wilson feels that the entertainment industry is changing and soon the Internet will be the main way people watch programming, and C&H fans are likely already on the cutting edge. ""The Internet is already the largest network, available when you think about it,"" Wilson wrote. ""Why go anywhere else?"" Fellow web content creator and Vlogbrother John Green showed his support for the creators and revealed that he and his brother Hank have run into similar problems when approached about bringing their YouTube channel to television. Every time we've ever talked to a cable TV network, we ask, ""So who will own this thing?"" And they say, ""Us."" And we're like, ""Yeah.

DeleteMeMobile [iTunes link] — which launched for iOS devices in the Apple App Store on Monday and already has several thousand users — aims to strip your personal data from many of the largest websites that collect and sell it, including Spokeo and Intelius.  These sites collect a huge amount of information about you, from estimated net worth, religious and political affiliations, children's names, websites visited and articles read (yikes). ""Hundreds of data brokers you've probably never heard of track everything people do, online and off,"" Sarah Downey, Abine privacy analyst, told Mashable. ""This collection of digital data is leading to the creation of a 'digital you,' and increasingly, decisions are being made based on this version of you, such as your credit scores, ability to get loans, insurance premiums, online shopping prices and whether you're hired."" The DeleteMe app is free to search what kind of information is out there about you and it comes with one removal from any data broker site. After that, there is a $24.99 subscription for three months with unlimited deletions. The app is similar to the company's web-based DeleteMe service. Here's how the app works: After downloading it and providing some basic information to sign up, the app searches data-broker sites looking for information about you. About eight results listings will pop up for the typical user. A user can click the results by saying ""This isn't me"" if it's not a proper match or hitting ""DeleteMe"" to remove the data. SEE ALSO: What Facebook's New Graph Search Means for Your Privacy
 ""That listing will be added to a list of requested removals, and it's updated whenever the listing comes down,"" Downey said.  Powering the app behind the scenes is a mix of automated technology and human-powered effort.  ""We built search technology to comb major data brokers for results, and when users request removal, we've automated some of those processes,"" she added. ""In many cases, though, it comes down to our team of DeleteMe Advisors — all of whom are Boston locals and a lot of whom are law students — to do the hard work of writing emails, sending letters and more."" Although I had initial trouble finding matches, due to using my current city location instead of my hometown, three of the five results were accurately linked to my identity. In two cases, the results creepily revealed the full names of my parents, including my mother's maiden name and my father's middle initial. The company told me that the revealing of my parents' names ""could just be the tip of the iceberg"" as to what these data brokers have saved. What's also interesting is that I've used data-swiping services before, but Abine said it's not rare for that information to come back again over time.  After hitting ""DeleteMe"" on one listing, I received a message that it could take up to a few weeks for the company to comply with my removal request. However, it was a little buggy after the removal process, as it didn't log it under its pending section. (Abine said it is looking into the issue). Although the app has received mixed reviews in the Apple App Store so far, Downey said — despite one review claim — information entered within the app is kept confidential. ""Abine does not share your personal information and states this in the app's privacy policy,"" Downey said. ""We wouldn't be able to exist as a company if users couldn't trust us."" UPDATE: This story has been updated from its original version with a quote from the company about privacy, as well as more details about our personal experience with the app.  Photo courtesy of iStockphoto, Goldmund "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/disney-infinity-in-depth/,'Disney Infinity' Wants to Make Playtime Digital: Will it Succeed?,"Disney Infinity is more than just a new game, it's a new business and merchandising model from Disney Interactive. One part Minecraft, two parts Skylanders, with dashes of Club Penguin and Mario Paint, it's Disney's most ambitious interactive investment yet. The new project — which Disney describes not as a game but as a ""universe"" — is Disney's attempt to fuse physical toys with a digital world. Borrowing heavily from Activision's blockbuster Skylanders, Disney Infinity works by attaching real world, physical figurines to the game. The experience of the game changes depending on what figurine is present on a connecting hub — a device Disney calls the ""Disney Infinity Base."" The game world will mimic the figurines, special powers and other objects placed on the Infinity Base. SEE ALSO: 'Disney Infinity' Is Epic Toy and Video Gaming Mashup Like Skylanders, Disney will make multiple sets of figurines, power discs (which sit below a character on the Infinity Base and offer extra powers or special features) and Play Sets (worlds within which a player can play) available for purchase.  Of course, what makes Disney Infinity unique is that its characters and Play Sets are from across the Disney and Pixar universe. Moreover, players can combine figurines from different franchises within the same game universe. John Lasseter, the chief creative officer at both Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios, told us that the idea behind allowing the separate worlds to merge was based on the way that kids actually play with toys. ""Look at how [Toy Story toy owner] Andy played with his toys,"" Lasseter said. ""He had a Buzz Lightyear, a Cowboy Woody and Mr. Potato Head and played with them all alongside one another."" Moreover, Lasseter says that the way Disney looks at the experience of Disney Infinity isn't as changing or expanding the storyline of the renowned franchises, it's about letting kids play with different characters within one universe. Disney only announced three franchises that will have initial support — Monster's University, Pirates of the Caribbean and The Incredibles, but executives promised multiple additional worlds and characters when Disney Infinity launches in June.  I asked John Blackburn, the leader of Avalanche Software (the Disney-owned game studio that built Infinity), about the possibility of having characters from Star Wars inside Infinity — after all, they are now part of the parent company. Blackburn said that, ""from a creative standpoint, I would love that — but it's too early to say anything definitive."" The decision, he said with a smile, is also ""above my pay grade."" Assuming Disney is as serious about its investment in Infinity as it says it is, I absolutely expect all of Disney's biggest characters and properties to make their way into the game. Disney's unique asset with Infinity is the characters. The more characters available, the better the experience. Infinity isn't really a game — it is, as the executives said, an experience and a new universe. Each Play Set will have mission-focused aspects — like a traditional game — but the element that had me believing this will be a winner was the open-ended play mode called ""Toy Box."" ""Toy Box"" is basically Minecraft with Disney characters. Users can create their own worlds and drop in objects, characters and power-ups to create their own adventures. One of the demos Disney showed us at their press event was the recreation of Bowser's Castle from Mario Kart, complete with a racer in a kart — in this case, Cinderella's magic buggy.   Disney said that it plans to let users upload their worlds and experiences to share with others. Once Disney vets the experiences and makes sure they are appropriate, other users can download and play or add on to the worlds and adventures created by others. In the hands-on demos, the focus was on the ""Toy Box"" more than the guided gameplay. Perhaps that functionality is further along in development, but I got the sense that this open-ended play is what Disney is really wanting to create. As a child, I would spend hours building elaborate Lego destinations that my other toys could visit and exist within. ""Toy Box"" just might be the digital equivalent. One of the more unique aspects of Infinity is that it isn't just being developed for game consoles. Disney is also targeting computers and mobile devices.  On the console front, the Wii, Wii U, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 will all support Infinity. For mobile, Blackburn would only confirm iOS support for now, but said the company is actively invested in supporting other mobile platforms — including Android. What is less clear is how seamless the experience will be for users who engage in the experience on a phone or tablet — versus with a game controller and TV. Blackburn told me that the team is looking at optimizing the experience for mobile play. When I asked why the focus on mobile, Blackburn said that its an increasingly important — or even primary — gaming device for its audience. Disney Interactive needs a hit. The division has been losing money for Disney over the last few years, and it's under pressure to become profitable this year. It's not a surprise to see a more concentrated effort on projects, such as Infinity, that include the addition of toy tie-ins alongside games. The big question will be: Is Infinity an experience kids will want to be part of? From my time with the demo, I think it is. I also think the quality of the figurines and the openness of ""Toy Box"" mode will make this a success. Disney Infinity will make its debut this June. ""Toy Box"" is the open-ended mode within Disney Infinity. Here, players can create their own free-form adventures. In this mode, characters from various franchises can all interact with one another. Sully and Mr. Incredible teaming up with Jack Sparrow? Awesome. Want to ride Woody's horse? Throw the famous Pixar ball? You can in ""Toy Box."" One of the announced play sets features the family and characters from ""The Incredibles."" Mr. Incredible is ready for action Mr. Incredible is fighting justice! Another play set is Monster's University -- including favorites such as Sully and Mike! I want to ride Sully's bike! The structured activities in this play set include playing college pranks on campus. Jack Sparrow and clan are the stars of another Infinity play set. The universe exists within the first three films. Jack Sparrow is ready for action. The famous ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" ride is one of the missions in this play set.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/dreamliners-grounded/,FAA Grounds All Boeing 787 Dreamliners," The Federal Aviation Administration grounded on Wednesday all Boeing 787 Dreamliners operating in the United States following a string of malfunctions that have plagued the new model aircraft. 787s are prohibited from operating in U.S. airspace until the FAA completes a safety inspection. The FAA's decision came after three separate problems involving the revolutionary composite-built 787. Earlier this month, an electrical fire struck a 787 parked at Boston's Logan International Airport and owned by Japan Airlines. Several days later, a separate Japan Airlines 787 had to cancel takeoff from Boston due to a fuel leak. On Wednesday, an overheating battery forced an All Nippon Airways 787 to make an emergency landing in Western Japan. Electrical problems, not the fuel leak, are at the core of the FAA's decision to ground the Dreamliner and launch a safety investigation of the aircraft. ""The battery failures resulted in release of flammable electrolytes, heat damage, and smoke on two Model 787 airplanes,"" the FAA said in a statement. ""The root cause of these failures is currently under investigation. These conditions, if not corrected, could result in damage to critical systems and structures, and the potential for fire in the electrical compartment."" United Airways, which operates six 787s, is the only American company with Dreamliners in its fleet. Since the FAA's decision, the European Aviation Safety Agency has also grounded all 787s in Europe. Qatar Airlines, LAN Airlines, Air India and Ethiopian Airlines have separately decided to ground their 787s, according to the Huffington Post. Boeing has promised to work with investigators to resolve any issues and get the 787s flying once again. ""We are confident the 787 is safe, and we stand behind its overall integrity,"" said Jim McNerney, Boeing chairman, president and CEO Wednesday in a statement. Do you want the 787s flying again?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/employee-outsourced-china/,"U.S. Employee Outsourced His Job to China, Watched Cat Videos Instead","Nowadays, sneaking in a personal call or quick browse through Facebook during work is typical on-the-job behavior. But what if you abandoned work completely and outsourced your job to, say, China? That's precisely what one U.S. developer got away with last year, paying a Chinese consulting firm 20% of his six-figure salary to do his job. Referred to as ""Bob"" in a case study outlined by Verizon's security team, the employee worked for a U.S.-based critical-infrastructure company, and was versed in C++, Java, Python, Ruby, as well as other programming languages. Despite his skills, however, Bob didn't do any work. Here's how a typical day went for him: 9:00 a.m. - Arrive and surf Reddit for a couple of hours. Watch cat videos.
11:30 a.m. - Take lunch
1:00 p.m. - Ebay time 
2:00 p.m. - Facebook updates, LinkedIn
4:30 p.m. - End-of-day update email to management
5:00 p.m. - Go home
 This particular company wasn't Bob's only victim; the Verizon report said he similarly scammed ""multiple companies in the area,"" earning several hundred thousand dollars a year, while the outsourced Chinese firm earned around $50,000 annually.  What's more, as Bob's performance reviews reveal, it was a business model that worked. For the past few years, he had been receiving ""excellent remarks,"" according to the report. ""His code was clean, well-written and submitted in a timely fashion. Quarter after quarter, his performance review noted him as the best developer in the building.""

Wise takes photos across New Zealand. If The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit didn't make you want to move down under, her Instagram account should do the trick. Mahoney is an aid worker for the United Nations at the Yida refugee camp in South Sudan, one of the most remote places in the country. For her 100th photo, she wrote: ""The Nuban people say that there are 99 peaks, 99 tribes and 99 dialects in their mountains. 99 is a very symbolic number for them. I dedicate the 99 previous pictures I have shared to them, to their resilience, to their strength, and to their humor, to their candor, to their frustration with war and to their anger that they can’t go home — the only thing they want for themselves and for their children."" A lifelong explorer of the polar regions, Instagrammer Degerman posts pictures of surfing with seals and bathing in waterfalls. You can also see his website here.  A teacher living in Pyongyang, North Korea, Kelly captures images of sights that most of us are unlikely to see in our lifetimes. He often captions his photos with notable quotes.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/facebook-graph-search-gallery/,10 Things We Learned From Facebook's Graph Search,"According to Facebook, the majority of people who like Star Wars on the site also like KFC. Star wars lovers are also fans of Dairy Queen and the Facebook Culinary Team. Dragon City ranked top amongst games played by people who like the TLC show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. Coming in second was Diamond Dash, followed by King.com's Pet Rescue Saga. This search for photos taken in pizza restaurants in Chicago brought up pictures of some pretty delicious looking pie. Facebook's internal culinary team ranked tops amongst Mashable readers. Coming in second were patrons of Ike's Sandwich shop in San Francisco. The Big Bang Theory ranked tops amongst engineers on Facebook. Coming in second place was Friends, followed by Game of Thrones. Topping the list of musicians' favorite games is Tetris Battle. Musicians are also apparently fans of Angry Birds Friends and Zynga's Texas HoldEm Poker. David Guetta ranks tops amongst Apple employees. Coming in second is the Black Eyed Peas, followed by LMFAO.  Pink Floyd, A.R. Rahman, and Lady GaGa ranked tops for Google employees. There are thousands of photos that have been uploaded to Facebook, and tagged with times long before founder Mark Zuckerberg was even born. There photos, for instance, were taken in France before 1970. Inception was a popular movie amongst people who like Mashable. Other top flicks include Fight Club and Star Wars. On Tuesday Facebook unveiled Graph Search, a new way to search for information on the social network. Currently in a limited beta, the feature allows you to search Facebook for things centered around four focus areas: People, Places, Photos and Interests. Searches unearth information shared by your friends, as well as public information on Facebook as a whole.
 
For instance, while traveling you can use the tool to find out what friends or friends of friends you might have in the area. If you're looking for a new job, you might use Graph Search to see if you or any of your friends happen to know anyone who works at your dream company. It could even be used for online dating. Curious what we could discover, we did a few off-the-wall searches using Graph Search to see what general, and interesting, information might be easily accessible now. Check out the gallery above for some of the unique searches we did, and what we found out. What will you use Graph Search for? Let us know your thoughts in the comments. Image credit, Mashable "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/facebook-loses-active-users/,Facebook Lost 1.4 Million Users. Does That Matter?," You've probably heard that ""a little knowledge is a dangerous thing."" It's fair to say the English poet who first wrote that wasn't thinking about social network usage data.  Still, in an age when we're bombarded with statistics, the phrase has become more appropriate than ever. And it's why you should take recent reports that Facebook lost more than a million active users with a pinch of salt.  Case in point: when Instagram's Daily Active Users seemed to drop by a quarter at the end of December, according to AppData, some commentators took it as a sign that the Terms of Service kerfuffle had driven 25% of the photo app's users away. But as Instagram announced Thursday, its Monthly Active User count has actually grown 10% since December, to 90 million users. Monthly active user numbers are more reliable, and less prone to day-to-day fluctuations. (AppData had also shown a rise in monthly users before Instagram stopped reporting its information to the service.) Now comes news that Facebook lost 1.4 million monthly active users in the U.S. in early December, as reported by the analytics firm SocialBakers. That's a more reliable indication that the service is slipping, right?  Wrong. First of all, SocialBakers is tapping into information Facebook gives its advertisers to test the reach of their ads; it isn't intended for precision user metrics. But even assuming the number is right on the money, consider that 1.4 million users is less than 1% of Facebook's U.S. total active user base — which is 167 million.  Consider this, too: Facebook's growth has never gone in a straight line. No growth ever does. As you can see in the video above, it has slipped back several times in the past — and always bounced back. Then again, Facebook is certainly approaching the definition of a mature market in the U.S., with more than half of everyone in the country using the service. Considering those under 13 can't join it, and many of those over 65 don't care to, it doesn't have that much room left to grow at home (though it is still growing like a weed internationally.) What do you think? Will Facebook user numbers continue to rise in the U.S., or is this the beginning of a stagnation period? Let us know in the comments.  Image courtesy of aflutter. "

""Well folkes im about to get shot. Peace,"" read the message from Eric Lee Ramsey, 30, of Mt. Pleasant, Mich. He posted the still-public message via a mobile device:  Ramsey's Facebook friends initially thought his post was a joke, only to realize the truth later. Their messages have not been published here in order to protect their privacy. Mashable verified the authenticity of the suspect's Facebook page by comparing his profile picture and other personal data with a police mug shot and information from local media. Ramsey's public photographs included an image, apparently posted as a joke, of three children and a dog seemingly locked in a dog cage with the caption ""needs a home, dog is optional."" Other images are more typical pictures of family and friends. SEE ALSO: Here's How Police Get a Suspect's Facebook Information
 Ramsey, who had previous convictions for assault and destruction of police property, was being pursued by police for kidnapping and then raping a Central Michigan University student, according to the Morning Sun. Ramsey approached the woman around 9:30 p.m. Wednesday on CMU's campus and forced her at gunpoint to drive his Ford Escape from campus, police say. The woman lept from the vehicle after Ramsey threatened to kill her. She was able to call police at approximately 10:05 p.m., telling a dispatcher that she had been kidnapped and sexually abused.  Ramsey was shot while being pursued by a Crawford County Sheriff's deputy at approximately 4 a.m. local time.  As of press time, there was no official word on how the suspect managed to post the prescient message to Facebook in the midst of the police pursuit, during which he ""rammed a sheriff's deputy's car head-on.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/fake-internet-girlfriend-manti-teo/,5 Ways to Fake an Internet Girlfriend Better Than Manti Te'o,"When Deadspin broke the news Wednesday that one of the nation's top NFL prospects, Manti Te'o, had a made-up dead girlfriend — a story the linebacker presumably gamed to land magazine covers and spots on ESPN sports shows — the Internet went ballistic. Twitter had a field day: ""Manti Te'o,"" ""So Te'o,"" and other related terms peaked at more than 3,000 tweets a minute. Many were incredulous — and for good reason: It's not 1993. You can't tell your friends you have a girlfriend you met at camp and only see once a year. Everyone and everything has an online footprint. You can't just get away with this. Or can you? If there's one thing to take away from this fiasco, it's that there's hope for Forever Alones who want to trick the world into thinking they're worthy of love. On the Internet, even in 2013, there are myriad ways to conjure a seemingly real lover from zeroes and ones. Chase Hoffberger's new girlfriend seemed perfect. Allison had a sly smile and brown eyes and texted him constantly — nice things like ""You are my only man. I'm gonna be be thinking about you!"" She was into roleplaying; she could ""act as anything you need me to, whether it be hispanic, asian, black, white, mixed, etc."" She was also 17. Oh yeah, and Chase bought her companionship for $5. He was testing the site GirlfriendHire.com, a virtual marketplace for ""flings"": For a given price, young women offer to perform nonsexual or sexual services (online) for a week. Flirt over text, critique your music taste, offer fashion advice, you name it. Chase, of course, just wanted an interview.  This Brazilian site is the whole package: You pay for different levels of fake-girlfriend completion. For 30 days at a time, the site will create a fake Facebook profile and update it with authentic-sounding statuses and comments. The Te'o package will set you back a cool $99.  College might prepare kids for a job interview, but it leaves them crippled with debt and unable to stop mooching off their parents until their 30s. Traveling is an amazingly valuable experience that no one can have anymore because it costs thousands of dollars. Fortunately, if you are rich and go on fun trips, you can convince broke college kids to be your fake girlfriends (or boyfriends) and even let you wiggle your genitals around their genitals. It's a win-win and not exploitative at all. How do you meet them? Easy! Sites like Sugar Daddie, SeekingArrangement.com, or Miss Travel make it happen.   Miss Travel - How It Works from Miss Travel on Vimeo. ""Discretion is guaranteed,"" the site claims. It damn well better be. Why else would you pay a monthly fee for top-tier girlfriending? The Fake Internet Girlfriend experience specializes in revenge and family cover-ups:
 Sometimes people hire a fake internet girlfriend to make an ex-girlfriend jealous. In fact, we get a lot of clients for this reason.  Sometimes people don't want to hear it from their family, they want to avoid the drama all together of the never ending questions about dating so they simply employ a fake internet girlfriend so their family will stop hounding them about finding the right girl.
  If the fake-girlfriend experts can't invent a dead girl who will win you media adoration, whom can you trust? Well, there's one last option. Here's an overlooked fake-girlfriend method that's foolproof until you ruin everything by telling the cops about it. You can pay Nigerian spammers a lot of money to be your Internet girlfriend. It works so well, you won't even realize they're spammers. 
Image courtesy of Flickr, Trixieroxxx Just make sure to overlook the fact that your love has bank accounts in three different continents. This poor schmuck in Illinois found out about it the hard way. Turns out he wasn't looking for a fake girlfriend at all. He was looking for a real one. And he sent ""her"" hundreds of thousands of dollars because he thought she was missing. That's really sad, actually. Don't do that. Photos courtesy of Flickr, zebrafacee; GirlfriendHire/Daily Dot

Instagram Dog Makes it All About Finding Momo,"Instagram users have their noses pressed up to their smartphone screens trying to spot the app's most elusive dog. Momo the border collie and his talent for blending in to scenery has made #FindMomo the real-life version of Where's Waldo?  Ontario-based graphic designer and Momo's best human friend, Andrew Knapp, discovered the dog's knack for hiding in plain sight while playing fetch. ""Momo does it himself,"" Knapp told Mashable. ""He runs off when I'm about to throw a stick, and waits until I throw it, usually camouflaged in the forest.""  Knapp's keen eye for landscapes also helped him create photographs people actually want to look at — with Momo or without. Still, the dog proves to be an eye-catching addition to his images. ""I love taking photos of these landscape and streetscapes, but without a subject or a sort of quirk, there was just nothing really interesting about them,"" Knapp said. ""With Momo in them, you're forced to look at the photo for at least a second or two.""  While Knapp said the game isn't ""that challenging,"" it has certainly engaged thousands of Instagrammers that play along in their feed. But fear not — Momo's Internet fame hasn't turned this Canadian pooch into a hotdog. ""He's never bragged once about being a good hider,"" Knapp said. ""He'll [still] be scared of you if you're wearing a big hat.""  Good to know Momo still has his paws firmly planted in the dirt — unless of course you're wearing a sombrero, in which case he'll be a foot off the ground while running away.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/how-to-watch-oprahs-lance-armstrong-interview-online/,How to Watch Oprah's Lance Armstrong Interview Online,"UPDATE: The first screening of the interview has now aired on the east coast and online. See reactions here. Before Manti Te'o girlfriend-gate came along, sports fans were captivated this week by the build-up to cyclist Lance Armstrong's interview with Oprah Winfrey, expected to be a watershed moment in the extended saga surrounding his alleged use of performance enhancing drugs.  It was leaked earlier this week that Armstrong would confess to doping to win his record seven Tour de France titles — a revelation many took as obvious given the mounting evidence against him in recent months. But, ever the brilliant entrepreneur, Oprah kept the anticipation going by saying, ""He did not come clean in the manner that I expected."" So how can you watch? The two-part interview — scheduled to air at 9 p.m. Eastern and Pacific times on Thursday and Friday — will be broadcast on the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN) as well as streamed online.  If you want to watch online, the interview will stream during each broadcast time on Oprah.com as well as OWN's Facebook page.  If you'd rather watch the old-fashioned way, this handy tool tells you how to find OWN in your area.  The Oprah interview will mark the culmination of a years-long did-he-or-didn't-he drama surrounding how Armstrong managed to dominate cycling so completely in the early 2000s. Over the past few months, much of that drama played out online. Here's a quick recap: In August, Internet users reacted in shock after Armstrong used a statement posted to his website to announce that he would finally end his long contention of doping charges by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). He admitted no wrongdoing, however, defiantly writing that ""I am finished with this nonsense."" The following day, he tweeted that donations to his Livestrong Foundation increased 25-fold since he released the statement. Armstrong founded Livestrong in 1997 after a bout with testicular cancer. The foundation aims to help others with cancer, and its positive reflection on Armstrong lent the debate over his steroid use a complicating twist. In October, Armstrong's former Tour de France teammate George Hincapie used a tweet and post to his official website to share a damning revelation. He admitted for the first time that he had taken performance enhancing drugs, and also said he'd named other users for investigators. Shortly after, the USADA released hundreds of pages of testimony from 11 of Armstrong's former riding mates. Later the same month, Armstrong made what many interpreted as a decidedly digital and indirect admission of guilt by removing his claim to seven Tour de France titles from his Twitter bio. In November, however, he posted a passive-aggressive photo of himself reclining while surrounded by the yellow jerseys he wore to win his seven Tours with the caption, ""Back in Austin and just layin' around..."" The image went viral with sports fans, quickly picking up more than 300,000 views on the social network Mobli — which Armstrong is an investor in.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/hubble-to-look-deeper-into-cosmos/,Hubble to Look Deeper into the Cosmos,"The Hubble Space Telescope's iconic ""Deep Field"" photo wowed the world in 1996 by revealing a huge collection of galaxies hiding inside a patch of the sky that looked like nothing more than blank space. Now NASA plans to image six more ""empty"" bits of sky for a whole new set of deep fields that could revolutionize astronomy once again. Hubble captured the Deep Field by staring at the same point over many hours, letting photons of light from extremely distant objects slowly pile up to reveal celestial bodies that would otherwise be too faint to see. SEE ALSO: Hubble's Dwarf Galaxy Stellar Treasure Trove
 Since the original photo's release, Hubble looked even longer at the same spot to create the ""Ultra Deep Field"" in 2004 and then the ""eXtreme Deep Field"" in 2012. But the new effort, called Hubble Frontier Fields, will be the first to try a similar technique on some new areas of the heavens. These photos won't go quite as deep as the Ultra Deep Field, but will represent some of the deepest images of the universe ever taken. ""As iconic as the Ultra Deep Field is, now we'll have six that are almost as nice,"" said Hubble scientist Dan Coe of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md., which manages the telescope. The Hubble Frontier Fields will collect light for about 45 hours each, spread over a period of three years, imaging objects that existed in the first 500 million years after the Big Bang. Plus, in a new twist, astronomers will image each of the six blank patches of sky in combination with nearby galaxy clusters, whose gravity can act as a cosmic magnifying lens to zoom in on small, distant objects behind them. SEE ALSO: Hubble Mosaic Pays Tribute to Van Gogh
 Researchers will ""observe six galaxy clusters and blank fields in parallel,"" Coe told SPACE.com. ""While they're observing a cluster, the other camera is just far enough away where it's not really looking at the cluster anymore. It'll be essentially blank. To really go deep in both of these at the same time, that's never been done before."" The added magnification boost of the clusters' gravity should make these pictures the deepest glimpses of the universe yet. The shots could capture galaxies that are older and farther away than anything ever seen before. ""Some of them will be among the most distant galaxies yet found,"" said Coe, who led the study of one of the current contenders for farthest galaxy ever seen, MACS0647-JD, which lies about 13.3 billion light-years away. The original Deep Field photo revealed about 3,000 previously unknown galaxies in a patch of sky only 2.5 arc-minutes across, or about one 24-millionth of the whole sky. The new fields will determine whether that huge haul was a fluke, or if almost any patch of blank sky contains a similar wealth of treasures.""You don't know, it might be a special part of the sky you're looking at,"" Coe said. Hubble will begin observing the first of the new fields later this year. The nearly 23-year-old telescope is still going strong after five upgrades from visiting space shuttle crews. NASA hopes to keep the observatory running until at least 2018, when its successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, is due to launch. Image courtesy of Flickr, Hubble Space Telescope/ESA

Then you'll love this C-SPAN clip, which compresses the inaugurations of every president since Ronald Reagan into a 36-second supercut. Obama's second official oath of office is actually happening at a private ceremony on Sunday, followed by a public ceremonial swearing-in Monday. Washington, D.C., officials and hotel owners aren't expecting the same number of visitors for Obama's 2009 inauguration, which drew an estimated 1 million-plus visitors. However, the D.C. metro system is still preparing to carry between 600,000 and 800,000 people to the event.  Looking for a place to watch the inauguration online? Mashable will have more details on that and other inauguration coverage in the days to come. Are you planning on attending the inauguration? Let us know in the comments below!

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/instagram-monthly-active-users/,"Instagram Now Has 90 Million Monthly Active Users, Up 10% From December","So much for reports that Instagram is suffering from an exodus of users.  Instagram revealed Thursday that it now has 90 million monthly active users. That's up 10% from the same period a month ago, according to a statement the company provided to AllThingsD. ""Instagram continues to see very strong growth around the world,"" Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom told AllThingsD. ""With many of the product and internationalization improvements we've made, we've been excited to see these efforts resonate with users globally."" This marks the first time that Instagram has ever released data on monthly active users. Facebook, which owns Instagram, revealed in September that the photo-sharing service had passed 100 million registered users. Since then, though, Instagram has encountered its fair share of controversy — first by disabling support for Twitter cards and then by changing its terms of service. Some data firms have reported that Instagram's user base had dipped recently as a result. AppData, a service that tracks apps connected to Facebook, said that Instagram's daily active user count had dipped by a quarter during the holidays, a fact that the firm speculated was due to the terms of service announcement. However, that report was widely panned and the new numbers from Instagram suggest that the number of users has continued to grow. Aside from revealing the number of monthly active users, Instagram also announced that users now share 40 million photos each day and post 1,000 comments and 8,500 likes per second.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/king-number-one-facebook/,King Overtakes Zynga to Become Number One in Facebook Gaming,"King.com is now number one when it comes to Facebook games. The company has overtaken Zynga for top honors on the social network, with three of its games making Facebook's top 10 in January. In the #1 slot is Candy Crush Saga.  A Bejeweled-style game that has players match three or more like pieces of candy together to remove them from the board. King initially launched the game on Facebook in April of 2012, following that launch with a mobile version of the game in November.  Still relatively new to Facebook, King's first Facebook game, Bubble Witch Saga, launched on the site just 18 months ago.
 
According to AppData Candy Crush Saga has more than 9.7 million daily players, beating out Zynga's FarmVille 2 with 8.8 million and Texas HoldEm Poker at 7.1 million.   On the mobile side, App Annie has the game listed as one of the top five grossing iPhone and iPad apps in 10 markets. King's CMO Alex Dale tells Mashable that mobile is what helped project the game to the top of the charts. ""People want to play a game on whatever device they want to whenever they want to,"" says Dale. Candy Crush Saga is currently played more than 55 million times per day on Android and iOS devices. Gameplay in Candy Crush Saga is synchronized across devices. So, if you make it to level 29 on your Galaxy S III on the train home from work, then you can start on level 30 when you crack open your laptop at home. Virtual goods purchases can also be used across all platforms, so if you make an in-app purchase on your iPad, that items will also be available when you're playing on Facebook. With all its games, King launches titles first on its own website as a single-level timed arcade game. When a title is successful, it turns the title into a ""Saga,"" adding more levels and bringing the game to Facebook, and later mobile.  The company's two other Facebook games, Bubble Witch Saga and Pet Rescue Saga, are also currently in the top 10 games on the social network.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/larry-page-criticizes-facebook/,Google CEO Says Facebook Is Doing a 'Really Bad Job' With Its Products,"Google CEO Larry Page had some harsh words for Facebook during a rare interview with Wired published on Thursday. When asked about Google's motivations for competing with Facebook in the social networking space, Page didn't mince words. ""They're a company that's strong in that space,"" he said. ""But they're also doing a really bad job on their products."" Page didn't elaborate on the reasons he thinks the company is doing a bad job, or which products he was referring to in particular, but it is still one of the more direct criticisms Page has leveled against Facebook to date. (In the past, Page has also criticized Facebook for being closed with its data.) The latest remarks happen to come just a couple days after Facebook launched a smarter search engine called Graph Search, which some say could be an early step to competing more directly with Google. That said, Page noted that Google doesn't need Facebook to fail as a company in order for it to succeed in social. ""We're actually doing something different,"" Page said. ""I think it's outrageous to say that there's only space for one company in these areas."" The CEO also said that he's ""very happy"" with Google+ so far while poking Facebook a little in process: ""A lot of it has been copied by our competitors, so I think we're doing a good job.""  Aside from talking about Google Plus, Page talked about the need to keep the company ambitious with ""moon shot"" ideas and teased the possibility that Google could eventually have 1 million employees working for it. ""Imagine what we could do if we had a hundred times as many employees,"" he said. Page also appeared to scoff at Steve Jobs' desire to wage a so-called thermonuclear war against Android. ""How well is that working?"" he said. Image courtesy of Flickr, Joi "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/manti-teo/,The Manti Te'o Saga Is Even Weirder Than We Thought,"The sports world and Internet in general were hit with a bombshell on Wednesday afternoon when it was revealed that the dead girlfriend of one of college football's biggest stars was in fact a social media hoax and never existed in the first place.  Manti Te'o, a star linebacker and Heisman Trophy candidate from Notre Dame reportedly began dating a young woman named Lennay Kekua early last year. She supposedly died of leukemia in September, but Te'o nevertheless played spectacularly and led Notre Dame to this year's BCS national title game. Along the way he sent Kekua tweets about how much he loved and missed her, and the story captivated the nation as it was reported on by outlets including Sports Illustrated, ESPN and CBS.  However, the sports blog Deadspin exposed the entire story as a myth on Wednesday. Not only had Kekua never died, she'd never been alive in the first place. The photos associated with her social media activity were, in fact, stolen from the account of a young California woman who was unaware of the hijacking.  Notre Dame and Te'o then released statements admitting that Kekua had never existed — but that Te'o was actually among the hoax's victimes, not its perpetrators. They had become aware of the truth in late December, they said.  But thanks to some Internet sleuthing by one Justin Megahan, it seems that others have actually been aware of Kekua's non-existence since well before then.  SEE ALSO: The Manti Te'o Lesson: We Are All Catfish
 Messages from a pair of Twitter users called @jayRahz and @ceeweezy51 talk about the hoax as far back as early December. They both seem to indicate that Ronaiah Tuiasosopo, a former high school football player, is the person behind the hoax, which is what Deadspin said in its report.  They also say that Tuiasosopo was inspired by the movie Catfish, a 2010 documentary following a young man who starts a relationship with a possibly fictitious woman over Facebook — which seems to back up Te'o's claims to obliviousness.  Here's a tweet by @jayRahz from Dec. 4: The person behind @lennaykay created the leukemia death story cause of @whatiscatfish — jay.R (@jayRahz) December 4, 2012 And another from the same day:  My fam & I have an idea who the guy is behind the @lennaykay profile & hes up there leading a worship band at his dad's church! SMFH — jay.R (@jayRahz) December 4, 2012 In a conversation from Dec. 12, @jayRahz and @ceeweezy51 go back and forth in a discussion that touches on the scam:  @ceeweezy51 and if it starts raining imma sell you out and say you're Lennay Kekua lol — jay.R (@jayRahz) December 12, 2012 For more you can check out Megahan's blog, but we may have the full story from Kekua her-or-him-self later today. In a cryptic series of tweets, @LennayKay, the handle that Te'o spent much of the fall tweeting with said on Thursday morning that it will ""be releasing a statement, via twitter, between 11am and noon today."" And just in case you wanted one more element of weirdness — and more apparent evidence of Te'o's possible innocence — check out the tweet embedded below. The fake Kekua was allegedly a Stanford student, and on Wednesday night former Stanford football player Matthew Masifilo tweeted that Te'o would ask about his ""mystery girl"" after games between Stanford and Notre Dame.  Got to believe Te'o was the victim here.He would always ask us if we knew his mystery girl after we'd play them.... — Matthew Masifilo (@MMasifilo) January 17, 2013 Meanwhile, an NFL player claims he met Kekua in person back in 2011.  Anyway, the eyes of the world will soon turn once again to ""Lennay Kekua"" for answers, and the story may well get weirder still. Nothing, at this point, is out of the question.  Do you think Te'o was in on the hoax, or is he just a victim? Give us your take in the comments.  UPDATE: @LennayKay's much-anticipated statement turned out to be a cruel dig at Te'o's poor performance against Alabama in the BCS title game earlier in January:  My statement: This is incredibly embarrassing to talk about, but I have been told by Alabama's offense that Manti Te'o is not real. — L K (@LennayKay) January 17, 2013 But this just raises a new set of questions. While @LennayKay is an account Te'o tweeted at during much of the fall, it was later changed to @LoveMSMK and a quick look via Hootsuite shows that this particular page was set up Wednesday. So it likely means some other joker claimed the handle since it had been dormant for 30 days or more.  But at this point very little is out of the question.  Photo via Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/mati-teo-we-are-all-catfish/,The Manti Te'o Lesson: We Are All Catfish,"There is no net. I tell Mashable reporters this all the time because the membrane between their reporting and the audience could be wafer-thin. What they report and write could be exactly what the audience reads. Not often, but sometimes, and if they misspell a word, misidentify a person or product or get any fact wrong, it's up to them to catch it before it's too late. That's one lesson of the incredible Manti Te'o story.  Te'o is the college footballer, Heisman runner-up and possibly soon-to-be pro player whose remarkable story of tragedy and triumph captivated the sports world. His grandmother and girlfriend reportedly died within a 24-hour span and Te'o went on to lead his Notre Dame team to victory. As Deadspin expertly reported (you simply must read this story), Te'o's girlfriend's death was a hoax. In fact, she never even existed. This brings us to the second lesson of this tale: We are all, potentially, catfish. Catfish is the 2010 documentary and now MTV series that looks at how average people's lives are turned upside-down when they fall for fake identifies online. Te'o claims to be one of those people. He told Deadspin he was duped and found the experience ""humiliating."" Deadspin's reporting indicates, however, that Te'o may know the perpetrator of the hoax online accounts for the non-existent dead girl. So we have two opposing forces here: The growing issue of online fakery and the media's inability to police the veracity of its own content.  The tension is obvious. You have a world that lives its life online. We're images, avatars, handles, quips, memes, gifs, Instagrams and texts, but we're rarely two people standing face-to-face or even ear-to-phone-to-phone-to-ear. How many people do you ""know"" whom you've never met in person? I count hundreds.  I assume these people are all real, because they have nothing to gain from me by being otherwise. Still the allure is obvious. Create a good profile, tell a good story, hook some gullible people or even co-conspirators, and then play it out until the end. The end, as Catfish and the Te'o incident show, isn't always good. In our day-to-day online activities, verifying that people are whom they say they are may not seem all that important. Unless, of course, it's your 14-year-old daughter talking to another 14-year-old girl she met online. Did you know 30% of teenage girls admit meeting in person someone they met online? Does your stomach feel, like mine, a little sick now? In reporting, the assumption is that you want the facts. It's the foundation of journalism. You want multiple sources for your story. Of course, today's journalism is not the journalism of the 20th century. Speed is valued above almost everything else. Even before the race to be first, the changing economics of digital journalism appeared to be preparing us for the coming fact holocaust.  When I was first in the magazine business in the late '80s and early '90s, we employed a team of fact-checkers — the last stop for every story before polish and publish. Fact checkers called sources and walked through quotes and pulled every nugget of information: dates, times, places, ages, locations, names, relationships, schools, and so on, to double check for accuracy. As a result, it was far more likely that a story would contain a typo than a factual error. As the Internet rose, traditional media felt the ground shift under its feet and then gradually slip away. Circulations faltered and then plummeted. Ad revenues shrunk and soon most publications, including those I worked for, looked for cuts. Research and fact-checking were the first to go. The loss of fact-checking hurt less than we thought, and most people still had enough time to work on stories and get the facts right (at PCMag, we published hundreds of pages every two weeks). Fast forward to today, though, and you see most, if not all reporting happening online first. Some of it still takes months and, like the Deadspin story, is extremely well-reported; other pieces, which are reported and written sometimes in minutes, probably less so. I can't see into the reporting process behind Sports Illustrated's  and ESPN's initial Te'o stories. According to Slate, ESPN's Gene Wojciechowski, who also reported the Te'o story, never found a record of the ""girlfriend"" Lennay Kekua's obituary or car accident. Why didn't he verify any of it with Kekua's ""family?"" Te'o apparently told them they did not want to be contacted.  Perhaps Wojciechowski was, like others, swept up by the heartbreaking and yet uplifting story of a football player who conquered, even after the death of his grandmother and girlfriend. I would bet, though, that most of the stories on the subject did not go through an old-school fact check. To do so might have put one or more reporters' stories second or last. We cannot go back to the old days of huge, expensive fact-checking departments, but clearly something needs to change. How can we trust a source when the very idea of identity is illusory? It's not impossible for time-constrained reporters to get the story right, but doing so is a team effort. Linking to sources, primary, secondary (even tertiary) is one way of validating your information for the reader, but also an excellent bulwark against reporters picking up baseless or second-hand information without attribution. I often counsel reporters to follow the thread of links from various stories all the way back to the original source. Re-reported content is, by its very nature, interpreted content. If it's true, the facts are somewhere at the end of this trail. In the case of Te'o, reports might have found that many of the links led nowhere, but to digital dead-ends. And while we're all checking links, we have to stop trusting social media accounts as reliable sources. It's incredibly easy to create fake accounts on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Google+, as Catfish and Te'o show, and most of us already know. All these services have tried to combat this by requiring the use of ""real names,"" verification and even shutting down accounts that are blatant impersonations. I commend those efforts, but they're largely ineffective.  Being someone other than yourself, a better, more perfect self or even someone completely different is obviously alluring to some people. The thrill of interaction with a person who likes that fake persona must, at least initially, feel like a validation.  Most of Catfish's stories, though, deal with one-on-one relationships. The Te'o case is different because someone, possibly Te'o or the person who created the fake girlfriend account, fooled a nation. The Internet did not create ""the hoax."" Piltdown Man, alien autopsy, real fairies in England, all happened well before the age of the Internet and social media. But those two factors have acted like digital lubricant, making it that much easier for even the most average of people to perpetrate the most remarkable hoax. And now our own true protector, the news media, seems particularly unarmed. Late last year, I predicted the end of anonymous trolls and the rise of reporting. At this moment I hope, maybe more than ever, that I am right, but I'm honestly not so sure.  What I am certain of is that there is no net — for reporters, editors and, most importantly, you.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/michelle-obama-twitter-accounts/,Here's Why Michelle Obama Has 2 Twitter Accounts,"Michelle Obama started a new Twitter account Thursday — @FLOTUS — racking up 25,000 followers in a few hours' time.  But wait, you may be thinking. Didn't Michelle Obama already have a Twitter account? You're right — Michelle Obama has been on Twitter as @MichelleObama since late 2011, gaining 2.6 million followers in that time. Here's the skinny: @MichelleObama is a political campaign account run by staffers at Obama for America (OFA), Barack Obama's presidential campaign. @FLOTUS, on the other hand, is an official government account for the first lady of the United States. The difference?  @MichelleObama tweets are considered messages from Michelle, the presidential candidate's wife, not Michelle, the first lady of the United States. That's why the account has been largely quiet since Election Day: It has tweeted only six times since the end of the campaign, half of them retweets from the @BarackObama campaign account. The First Lady invites you to take part in a National Day of Service this Saturday: OFA.BO/C5WYXs — Michelle Obama (@MichelleObama) January 15, 2013 @FLOTUS tweets are to be treated as messages from Michelle as first lady — a role that has no constitutionally-mandated duties but is a de facto public celebrity who represents the White House in her public appearances and comments, including her tweets.  The First Lady just met with Inaugural citizen co-chair David Hall ahead of #MLKDay of Service: 2013pic.org/service twitter.com/FLOTUS/status/â€¦ — FLOTUS (@FLOTUS) January 17, 2013 Putting the legal complications of official White House messages aside for a moment, different accounts for candidate's wife Michelle and first lady Michelle give Obama the option to choose from whichever platform is most appropriate for her message. It's the digital equivalent of style-shifting, the idea that a speaker changes his or her linguistic choices based in part on his or her role in relation to an audience. There's a bit more to it, though: @FLOTUS tweets, as White House communiques, are also legally required to eventually be archived in a publicly-accessible fashion under the Presidential Records Act.  That law, passed in 1978 following the resignation of President Richard Nixon, is also why @FLOTUS and other official White House staff say that ""tweets may be archived"" in their Twitter bios (as a side note, citizens' social media interactions with official White House accounts are also preserved by the White House under the PRA). SEE ALSO: Michelle Obama Has a New Twitter Account
 The firewall between official government accounts and campaign accounts has been evident in the Obama administration's past Twitter activity: President Obama answered questions in a December Twitter town hall on the fiscal cliff not with his @BarackObama campaign handle, but with the @WhiteHouse account. With the campaign over, he was acting as President Obama, not candidate Obama, and thus had little use for @BarackObama. hey guys - this is barack.ready to answer your questions on fiscal cliff & #my2k.Let's get started. -bo — The White House (@whitehouse) December 3, 2012 Additionally, Vice President Joe Biden is in a Twitter situation similar to that of Michelle — his campaign account is @JoeBiden, his official Office of the Vice President of the United States account is @VP.  Happening now: President Obama & @vp Biden announce proposals to reduce gun violence: at.wh.gov/gRNX0 — Office of VP Biden (@VP) January 16, 2013 The official account vs. campaign account firewall is also probably why @FLOTUS isn't following @BarackObama, a campaign account that has recently been tweeting about gun control as OFA shifts from support-the-candidate to support-the-president-in-office mode as it did in 2009. Stand with the President to reduce gun violence: OFA.BO/STKzAr, twitter.com/BarackObama/stâ€¦ — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) January 17, 2013 Have you followed @FLOTUS yet? Will you?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/milestonepod/,This Gadget Knows When to Replace Your Running Shoes,"Your feet take a lot of stress. By the time you reach the age of 50, most people have walked 75,000 miles — perhaps many more if you're a runner. Having the right running shoes is important for the health of your feet and knees.  It's usually recommended that running shoes are replaced every 400 miles. But if you don't feel like keeping track of hundreds of mile ran, you might be interested in the MilestonePod.  The tracking device attaches to your shoes and warns you before they wear down that you'll need another pair.   The company is currently seeking funds on crowdfunding platform Indiegogo. To make the MilestonePod a reality, they'll need about $42,000 in the next two weeks to reach their $60,000 goal.  The company explains on its Indiegogo page why keeping track of how much wear your shoes have is important: ""The new MilestonePod (patent pending) allows you to passively track the mileage logged on your running shoes so they can be replaced at the correct time, not too soon (wasting valuable tread) and not too late (potentially causing injury).  ""Although your shoes may continue to look new, the constant pounding from running causes the materials to wear down and stop providing support and protection. This reduction in shock absorption often leads to injury.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/new-myspace-review/,"The New Myspace: Music Meets Social, Done Right","Myspace is all-new, and it's all about making music social. The new site is backed by Justin Timberlake and incorporates many elements of modern web design, particularly an emphasis on visual media. Although the site excels at discovery, its iconography is sometimes perplexing. Myspace's design is based on a horizontal scroll, which incorporates a news feed of your updates and those of other users and artists you're following. Cover photos must be high quality, and your playback queue (seen on the bottom) is always present. If you mouse over the queue, as in this screenshot, album covers appear. Setting up your profile thankfully doesn't take long, and you can use your Twitter or Facebook accounts to log in. You can also log into the new site with your ""MySpace Classic"" info. Myspace asks a little about your background and interests, which determines the areas on the site where like-minded users can find you. The new Myspace keeps privacy settings simple, at least for now. Finding artists and songs to connect with is easy once you figure it out. The site encourages you to create and share playlists, called Mixes. You can make them private, too. Just start typing anywhere, anytime on the site to begin a search -- very convenient. Not sure where to start on Myspace? Browsing people in your area or who share your interests is as good a place as any. You can browse the users and artists you've connected with very easily. The site's layout is clean throughout. The Trending page has many articles on various entertainment topics, but would probably be better served by an aggregator. Here's what an article looks like -- very similar to the news apps in Windows 8. Myspace puts the focus on what you're sharing in any moment, pushing the rest of the site to the background. The icons that represent the nature of your connection with people are a little confusing at first, though the ""affinity"" you have with someone else is arguably more helpful. Videos take up you're whole browser window, but if you navigate away they get reduced to a smaller pop-up window, with no interruption in playback. Myspace's clever 404 page, which includes a Mix. The new Myspace is pretty. It incorporates many of the trends in modern web design and social media — big visuals, responsive design, easy discovery — and gives them a clear focus: connecting through music. And it really works. You may remember the old capital-S MySpace (""MySpace Classic,"" in the new site's parlance). The old site was the one-time social media king, boasting more than 100 million users at its peak. However, it also had a Wild West reputation with a lot of NSFW content, chaotic user profiles (filled with tacky design and annoying auto-playing songs), and tons of spam accounts. When Facebook offered a cleaner, more manageable alternative, MySpace users abandoned the service in droves. Now Myspace is back, and it's no exaggeration to say it's better than ever. The service opened in limited form last fall, and now it's available to anyone who wants to join. From the first minute you spend on the site, it's clear that the new Myspace has learned a lot from successful social networks, especially those that emphasize visual media, such as Pinterest. Case in point: Like most social sites today, Myspace calls for both a profile picture and a cover photo. The cover pic, however, has a minimum size of 1,024 x 768 — probably the most high-res requirement for a cover photo that exists. The pic takes up the entire browser window, so the strict rule is definitely a good thing, preserving the experience for yourself and everyone. It also subtly discourages you from sticking an easily downloaded (and probably copyright-violating) pic in there. The cover photos are just the tip of a visual-design iceberg, though, extending to photos in your feed, artist pages and the discovery process. It's extremely user-friendly, with actions typically only taking one or two clicks. When you try to do something, it usually does exactly what you expected, sometimes better. As I got my feet wet in the new Myspace, it struck me how much the site reminds me of Windows 8. The horizontal scroll is the most obvious parallel, but to goes further: Wherever you are in the site, you can just start typing to search for something — exactly how the start screen in Windows 8 works. It's a superbly convenient feature that I wish more sites and services would incorporate. SEE ALSO: New Myspace: 8 Essential Tips and Tricks
 Myspace also mirrors Windows 8's People hub a little, putting all the updates from the friends and artists you connect with in one big horizontal stream. There's clearly no curating algorithm yet, merely dumping all the latest stuff from your contacts into an everscroll, but the break from Facebook's ""edited highlights"" approach to the news feed feels refreshing and honest... at least for now. Finally, the service also features the dubious inclusion of a news feed (labeled ""Trending""), with what appear to be original articles from Myspace staff. This is one of the new site's weakest elements. The pieces themselves are a grab bag of roundups about entertainment topics with a few longer profiles on some artists, but it's all fairly random. I believe the site would be better served by a curated news aggregator, pulling in articles from a variety of show-biz sites based on your preferences and connections. Perhaps that is to come. The site is clearly intended to be first and foremost a music service, mixing a Spotify-like player (and radio) with elements of Facebook and Pinterest. The result is one of the best services for music discovery I've seen. Eventually Myspace intends to expand the service into all entertainment — it made a big announcement with Panasonic a year ago about TV integration — but with Justin Timberlake backing the site, music was a logical first move. Myspace has a top-notch music player, which interacts with the site content extremely well. It constantly resides at the bottom of the screen, and whatever media you select enters the queue and starts playing as soon as you click on it. If you're in the middle of listening to a playlist (or ""Mix""), the song or video just slips into the queue without disturbing the rest of it. The player handles videos excellently. When you begin playing a video, it'll automatically take up the whole browser window, but if you move your mouse, the site navigation immediately appears. Click on something else and the video is instantly reduced a smaller window in the lower corner, playback undisturbed. You can even close that window and still listen the song, again with no interruption. Perfect. Music discovery works well, too — in fact, it's the primary reason to use Myspace instead of, say, Spotify or Grooveshark. First there's the big Discover button that encourages clicking, and when you do you're rewarded with compelling imagery and a few simple, clear options such as Music, Mixes and People. Browse just a little and you're sure to find something you're looking for, whether it's hip-hop Mixes or reggae DJs in your city. Use the new Myspace for a little while, and you'll quickly find yourself engaging with music more than you would on other sites. Whereas services like Pandora and Spotify are often more about passively listening, Myspace is all about users actively seeking out fans and artists with the same passions. It's what I believe Apple had initially wanted Ping to be, but done right. If the new Myspace has a problem, it's a learning curve that's steeper than it needs to be. When you log on for the first time, the site encourages you to make connections with other users, but it's not immediately clear how to do that. The site needs some more signposts and walk-throughs on getting started beyond the option to ""take a tour,"" which actually isn't that helpful. Iconography is at times perplexing. The ""connection"" rings, which symbolize your relationship with songs, artists and other users — everything on the site, really — feel a little weird. (For what they mean, here's a guide.) It's a needlessly more complicated version of Twitter's Following/Follows You nomenclature. Although it's not that hard to understand, the fact that it needs a tutorial makes the site feel more insidery — not good for site that revolves around music. And then there are the artist pages. Some have an active presence on the site, and Myspace apparently has a ""verified"" system, represented by a blue check mark underneath the person's profile pic, although again the site would be helped by more clear labeling. However, shortly after I joined Myspace, a profile that claims to be Paris Hilton connected with me. It's most likely a fake account — the scourge of Classic MySpace — and I hope the new site polices these diligently. SEE ALSO: Spotify Wants to Make Music Discovery Truly Social
 The flip side of the fake-account issue is the service's inherent democratization of artist access. Similar to Twitter (but with more depth) or Facebook (but with more focus), Myspace allows artists to interact with fans directly, showcase their best work and perhaps even learn a thing or two from them. By its nature, Myspace encourages more engagement between parties beyond just ""Likes,"" and I'm excited to see what emerges from the new relationship — assuming the site takes off. From the user experience alone, it's hard not to declare the new Myspace a success. However, the challenges it now faces are of marketing and overcoming its own past. Many still think of the site as the abandoned amusement park of social networks, and it's going to need a lot of positive word-of-mouth to reach a critical mass of interest to truly become a force again. In that way, the new Myspace reminds me again of Windows 8: All the tools for success are now in place, and now it just needs to overcome prejudice and convince the audience to respond.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/oprah-lance-armstrong-reaction/,Lance Armstrong Interview Stirs Outrage on Social Media,"Part one of Oprah Winfrey's exclusive interview with disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong aired online and on Oprah's cable channel OWN Thursday night — and Armstrong's performance appeared to win over few critics on Twitter or Facebook. After years of denials to authorities and the public, Armstrong admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs and blood doping prior to his 2008 comeback from retirement. However, he denied that he did so in 2009 and 2010. He also denied that he had applied any pressure to his Tour de France teammates to join him in doping, and said that he had felt that he was not cheating because he ""looked the word up in the dictionary."" Looking uncomfortable, shifting in his seat repeatedly and laughing nervously, Armstrong appeared to be having a hard time explaining the details. His apology to Emma O'Reilly, his former masseuse and a whistleblower whom Armstrong sued and admitted to calling a variety of epithets, was particularly tortured. (The cyclist chose to focus on denying that he had called O'Reilly ""fat."") Armstrong admitted that he was a ""jerk"" and a ""prick"" at various points in the interview, and that saying sorry was not his forte. ""All of this is a process for me,"" the cyclist said. ""I'll spend the rest of my life trying to earn back trust and apologize."" On Twitter, the interview-related hashtags #OWNTV and #Doprah were trending topics, as was O'Reilly's name. Users appeared incredulous at Armstrong's answers: Did you feel wrong? No. Did you feel bad? No. Did you think you were cheating? No. — Emily Steel (@emilysteel) January 18, 2013 With this lack of remorse, Lance Armstrong could be the next spokesperson for the NRA. — Nick Bilton (@nickbilton) January 18, 2013 After this, I bet #Lance is going to grab a drink with James Frey. — Jason Feifer (@heyfeifer) January 18, 2013 As I understand it, after years of maintaining he was House Gryffindor, Lance Armstrong has admitted to being Slytherin all along. — John Scalzi (@scalzi) January 18, 2013 And at least one fellow celebrity was distinctly unimpressed: Ruthless, lying, bullying, completely unprincipled, disloyal coward#Armstrong — mia farrow (@MiaFarrow) January 18, 2013 There was better news for Armstrong on his Facebook page. Though his post announcing the interview was filled with many vitriolic comments, it also received messages of support — and some fans pointing out that doping is a more widespread problem.

A photo of the incident shot by a straphanger on the platform, and then captured by Humans of New York, has begun making its way across Facebook and Tumblr. The caption of the photograph describes what happened: ""I was on the G-Train heading north through Brooklyn when the train abruptly stopped before the Hoyt-Schermerhorn station. The conductor shut down the power of the train, and held us there for about 20 minutes. When we finally pulled into the station, a breathless woman entered my car. 'A woman had a seizure and fell on the tracks!' she said, excitedly. 'And a train was coming into the station! Luckily the driver noticed and slammed on the brakes.' She pulled out her phone to show just how close the train had come to hitting the woman. Supposedly, after the last few incidents, the MTA has been urging its drivers to be hyperaware when entering stations. Looks like a life was saved today by one driver who took the warning to heart."" Brandon Stanton, the photographer behind Humans of New York, told Mashable in an email that the striking photograph is ""completely authentic."" BONUS: 9 Inspiring Photo Blogs You'll Love

What it captures: Travel scenes ""In 2008 I packed my bags and hit the road with a rucksack half full of clothes and half full of camera equipment. One year later, I returned and set up my blog to show my friends and family what adventures I'd had along the way. From there, I started getting photography commissions and now regularly travel the world photographing different countries, festivals and events. ""Photography has been a passion of mine for a long time, and I'm fortunate enough to now make a living out of my hobby. It makes me feel very lucky and happy to travel to different parts of the world and record what I find. Having said that, sometimes it drives me nuts -- usually due to bad weather or just not getting the quality of shots I want. I think this motivation is important though, as it makes you constantly try harder."" -- Tom Robinson At left is Robinson's favorite photo, taken in a very remote part of Bolivia. Who shoots it: James Nord
What it captures: Fashion as art ""Photography makes me feel thankful. Thankful that I have found myself in a situation where I get to show people, through my perspective, a world that surprises me daily. Thankful that I get to work with individuals and brands that I have respected for years. Thankful that I have the opportunity to do something every day that I love. ""What makes for a good picture is really pretty simple: Keep your subject interesting, your technique sound and good pictures will follow. Great pictures, however, are a little more elusive and complex. For me, what makes a great picture is mood and surprise. I think great pictures teach people something new: about a person they thought they knew, a trend they thought they hated, a political movement they were once ambivalent about. Great photos do more than inspire, they can create real, tangible change. It's the hardest, most rewarding thing in the world when you can capture an idea in a photograph.""  -- James Nord Who shoots it: Jamie Beck and Kevin Burg
What it captures: Fashion and cinemagraphs ""I've been a photographer basically my entire life. It is how I see the world, how I communicate what I see in my mind and express how it feels to me. Through photography, I get to create the world I wish I lived in. My creative partner, Kevin Burg, encouraged me to start a blog as a way to share my archive of film photography that was just sitting in the closet collecting dust. I never expected the community or power it has grown into. ""Cinemagraphs were inspired by a conversation Kevin and I were having about creating digital art and content that was more than a photo but we felt nobody would watch videos, so what is the in-between? Something instant but alive. Kevin had been working for a couple years on this idea and we brought it to life at New York Fashion Week as part of my coverage through Tumblr in 2011. I think people like them because it simplifies a living moment, you can understand it instantly, but you can also get a little more information than just a still photograph."" -- Jamie Beck Who curates it: Sean Sullivan

It's a collection of famous figures, such as Lauren Bacall and Sean Connery, looking nothing but cool and stylish. Who shoots it: Canadian photographer Tommy Ton
What it captures: Fashion and street style  ""Initially I had only my site JakandJil.com to serve as a gallery for my photos, but then I thought by introducing a blog, I felt it was a better platform and there was an immediacy and spontaneity that I liked which worked better for my style of photography. ""Photography is definitely a form of creative expression that really encapsulates how one sees things.  We all see beautiful moments but to capture a moment in time and share what you saw and felt in that moment is truly an art.  It makes me feel liberated and capable knowing that I can share how I see things differently in this art form. To be able to express my view on fashion through photography is escapism."" -- Tommy Ton Who shoots it: Trey Ratcliff
What it captures: Wanderlust-inducing shots from around the world Trey Ratcliff describes himself on his website as, ""a warm-hearted, old-school gentleman explorer with really cool toys.""

What it captures: ""Man-repelling"" high fashion ""I was a journalism student at the New School and didn't really find that I could inject much humor (or sarcasm) into my writing, so I figured starting a blog would be a great place to do that. ""Photography is very important, especially in an industry that is as visual as fashion. There's a reason the fashion world took so well to Instagram. The over-stimulation is important. Words, content, smart theory is great, but that's only a door you can allow yourself open if there is an interesting visual element reeling people in. ""Before Man Repeller, I wasn't even allowed up at Hearst -- as an intern, I would bring over couture samples and be forced to enter via messenger delivery entrance. Six months post-Man Repeller inception, I was writing for Harper's Bazaar and summoned to swing by to meet Glenda Bailey.

We also were interested in discovering the best photographers and the most interesting photos. Not being able to find an online space like that, we finally decided to build our own. ""I think photography is the best communication method -- it's highly descriptive, quick to create and has a very strong emotional connection with the viewer. It is also one of the best methods to channel one's creativity and the vision of the world. It makes me feel (especially when I am going out) like an explorer and an artist at the same time.

Ofcom called Playboy's negligence ""serious, repeated and reckless."" ""There are a number of controls that websites can use to verify the age of users,"" said a statement from Ofcom. ""This includes asking for credit card details before any adult content is made accessible. Credit cards, unlike debit cards, are not available to under 18s.  Playboy TV and Demand Adult had breached UK rules by having no effective systems in place to protect under 18s from unsuitable free and paid-for content."" Demand Adult, one of the two sites, has a button saying ""Enter I am over 18,"" after which, hardcore porn is displayed. To view additional content, users can enter a debit card number. Neither the self verification nor the debit card are valid forms of age identification, Ofcom says, explaining its fine of £65,000 for Demand Adult. SEE ALSO: Startup Thinks Real Sex Can Sell

Now that Windows 8 has been out for a while, Pokki is updating the Pokki Start menu for Windows 8, updating the user interface and adding a number of customization features for users to make it their own. Pokki’s original app brought the traditional Start menu back to Windows 8, with an added twist. “We didn’t just bring back the old one, “ Chester Ng, co-founder and CMO of SweetLabs, told Mashable during a demo of the original app. “We agree with Microsoft that that one is outdated, and has a bunch of things that people don’t use. So we decided to take a familiar, yet modernized, take on what the start menu should be today.”  Pokki’s Windows 8 app includes not only a Start button, but also a smartphone-like home screen where users can organize Pokki apps as well as websites, files, folders, and other Windows applications that are important to them. Just like on your smartphone, applications can be arranged however you like. Wednesday’s update offers easier access to settings and customizations in Windows 8, improved Search, and moves the notifications panel to a drop-down box, allowing for reduced Start menu width and easy access to app alerts.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/red-october-coming-down/,Mystery Online Theft Operation 'Red October' is Winding Down,"The mysterious global cyber espionage operation known as ""Red October"" appears to be ending. After being revealed by online security giant Kaspersky Labs on Monday, the operation is being dismantled, according to researchers.  ""Red October is disappearing quickly,"" wrote Claudio Guarnieri, a security researcher at Rapid7. ""I think the infrastructure has been almost completely dismantled, or at least moved elsewhere.""  ""On the night between [January] 14 and 15 the Red October infrastructure started to disappear,"" Costin Raiu, a Kaspersky Labs senior security researcher confirmed to Mashable. ""Domains are actively being shutdown,"" Kurt Baumgartner, another Kaspersky researcher, wrote in an email.  ""Services are actively coming down that were responding yesterday. Servers that we previously saw as active are coming down and denying connections."" The Red October operation, explained Raiu, used multiple layers of domains, proxies and ""superproxies"" to route traffic around and diguise the origin of the attacks. ""It's like an onion with multiple skins,"" he said. At the core of the onion there's what the researchers refer to as the mothership, which is ""some super big powerful server database which collects all that stolen information.""  Since Kaspersky revealed the existence of Red October, that outer layer seems to be crumbling. ""The mothership appears to be active but perhaps the outer layer, the outer skin, is severely crippled."" Raiu noted that this could be the result of companies taking efforts to shut down the operation, as well as the criminals themselves adjusting to being exposed. ""It's a combination of registrars killing the domains, hosting companies killing the servers and the attackers shutting down some parts of the operation,"" he said. This doesn't mean that Red October has been completely shut down or that the attackers have been defeated. ""I think the operation will go dormant for a while. I know from previous cases that when some modules were discovered, the cybercriminals go underground, they go dormant for a few months and then they come back using different servers, different domains, different samples,"" Raiu said.  Kaspersky revealed on Monday that the global spying operation has been going on for at least 5 years, targeting multiple government networks, embassies, research institutions and other agencies across the world. The malware used for the attacks was designed to steal documents, passwords, emails, record keystrokes, take screenshots and perform an array of other tasks. Whether the operation is being dismantled, slowed down or is still alive and well, the damage is probably already done. The attackers behind Red October might have already stolen thousands of documents, including sensitive encrypted files. Kaspersky researchers noted that the attackers went after some files encrypted with Acid Cryptofiller, an encryption software used by the European Union and NATO. The German magazine Der Spiegel found out that certain targeted files were encrypted with the German software called Chiasmus.  These files likely contain very important information, notes Raiu.  Can their encryption be cracked? Normally, just losing encrypted files like these wouldn't be a reason for concern, since you still need a key to open them and they are very hard to crack with brute-force attacks. But since Red October malware was designed to record keystrokes, it's possible that the hackers recorded the passwords needed to decrypt the files. If the victims were using public key infrastructure, explains Raiu, all the hackers need is a decryption key usually stored on the user's computer. Red October was designed to look for those kinds of files too.  ""We can probably assume that the attackers have now collected the required encryption keys and passwords which allow them to decrypt the documents encrypted by these schemes,"" Raiu said.   SEE ALSO:  Cybersecurity Guru Calls for More Online Regulation
 According to Raiu, these new developments in the Red October saga don't help shed a light on who could be behind one of the most complex cyber espionage efforts ever uncovered. Contrary to the independent researchers previously contacted by Mashable, Raiu isn't too confident that this is a state-sponsored attack.  ""There's no clear actor behind this attack,"" he said, adding that it's more likely to have originated in a Russian-speaking country than in China. He doesn't think it fits the pattern of other Chinese malware. ""After you look at thousands of different malware bodies and thousands of viruses you start seeing patterns and certain techniques which are common to certain types of threat actors,"" Raiu explained. ""It's like, if you look at paintings [...] you are capable of saying that 'yeah this is most likely is a painting which belongs to Picasso or Dali, or it's from the impressionist period or from the cubist.' ""  Obviously all these patterns and techniques can be copied to lead investigators down the wrong path, following false flags intentionally used to throw them off. In other words, we might never know who is behind this.   Photo courtesy of iStockphoto, Pashalgnatov. Infographic courtesy of Kaspersky Labs. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/rim-overseas/,Will RIM's Battle for Survival Be Fought Overseas?,"There may be some light at the end of the tunnel for Research In Motion after all. The BlackBerry maker, whose market share and revenues have been in free fall, still has hope in overseas markets, where smartphones still have a lot of room to grow. A new study from Nielsen shows smartphone penetration in the relatively large markets of Brazil, Russia and India is still well below 50%. In the U.S., smartphone users became the majority among mobile customers in March 2012, and in November comScore reported that more than half of the population (whether they were mobile customers or not) owned a smartphone. That's good news for RIM, who in recent years has enjoyed much more success with its BlackBerry phones abroad than in North America. Even as its market share among smartphones shrank, the company would often cite growth overseas and in emerging markets, buoyed by its phones' relatively cheap data plans and popular BlackBerry Messenger network. At the end of the month, RIM will finally have its big coming-out party for BlackBerry 10, the mobile platform it hopes will breathe new life into the company. If RIM can keep prices down for both the phones and data plans — especially in those large markets cited in the Nielsen study — it may still be able to cultivate many new customers. SEE ALSO: Major U.S. Cellphone Carriers to Support BlackBerry 10, Report Says
 The market with the most potential is India, the second-most populous country on Earth with 1.2 billion people, where a massive 80% of mobile customers are still using feature phones. Although RIM has had problems dealing with the Indian government over access to enterprise-encrypted email (which infamously led to one of its former CEOs storming out of a BBC interview), Indian wireless providers are reportedly gearing up for BlackBerry 10. Overseas markets could be where RIM's battle for survival is won or lost. Apple's iOS and Android have been eating up its market share for years, but RIM still sells a significant number of phones in many countries (a study from August 2012 showed BlackBerrys accounted for almost 10% of sales in the U.K., to 1.5% in the U.S.). However, those numbers are in rapid decline as well. Will BlackBerry 10 be enough to reverse the company's slide? It may be too late to win back the U.S., but places like Brazil — where only about a third of the population owns a smartphone — RIM may find a more level playing field. RIM's stock price has been climbing steadily over the past few months, despite its poor earnings report that saw the company's first net loss of subscribers ever. Are you optimistic about RIM's future? Let us know in the comments. You unlock a BlackBerry 10 device by swiping up from the bottom of the screen. When you swipe up, the lock screen dissolves into the home screen on the device. Swiping to the side brings up additional pages of apps. You can also navigate through pages of apps by tapping on the scroll bar on the bottom of the screen. Taking a page from Windows Phone, RIM is adding “Active Frames” to BB10. Much like the ""Live Tiles” found in Windows Phone, the frames update with information you can see at a glance. For instance, the weather app will show the current temperature as well as a 7-day forecast, the calendar app shows your next event for the day. BlackBerry Hub can be accessed by swiping across the screen. Contact cards include phone numbers, email addresses and social-networking details. RIM is taking the look and feel of its home screen and bringing it into groups. Active frames make an appearance in groups, allowing you to see chats pertaining to a particular group, people who are a part of the group, and photos that have been uploaded. Pictures change as they are uploaded to the group, so if someone uploads a new one then that image will change on the group's page. Tapping on a person in a group will bring up his or her contact card. Taking photos in BlackBerry 10 starts out much like taking photos with any other OS, with the ability to tap on any portion of the photo to focus on a specific portion of the frame. If a photo you take is blurry, or someone in the picture has his or her eyes closed, you can use the scroll bar on the bottom of the screen to move forward and backward in time to capture the perfect shot. Much like you can adjust a whole picture, you can also pic out individual faces in a photo to adjust. So, if one friend has her eyes closed in a picture, you can just adjust herface in the photo.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/rip-linkedin-answers/,RIP LinkedIn Answers,"LinkedIn will pull the plug on LinkedIn Answers, its Quora-like Q&A service, on Jan. 31. The company sent an email to LinkedIn users on Thursday explaining the move. A LinkedIn rep sent the following statement:
 ""As of Jan. 31, LinkedIn Answers will be retired from LinkedIn. We will be focusing our efforts on the development of new and more engaging ways to share and discuss professional topics across LinkedIn. In the meantime, members can still pose questions and facilitate professional discussions through other popular LinkedIn channels including LinkedIn Polls, Groups, or status update."" The apparent reason for the move: It was driving fairly limited engagement. The company introduced LinkedIn Answers in 2007. The product let you post a question to your network (including second-level connections) and let other LinkedIn users provide answers. Questioners could rank the best answers and the person who provided the best answers would carry more weight for future Answers. Amy Vernon, gm for SocialMarketing for Internet Media Labs, wrote in a blog entry that she's going to miss the product: ""Maybe not everyone who uses LinkedIn uses the section. The people who do use it, however, find great value, and there are many. When I answered a question there after I was laid off from my newspaper job a few years ago, that led to one of my first consulting gigs, which in turn led me to the path I walk now. So, sure, part of it is likely sentimental. I can be like that sometimes."" The move comes after Facebook announced last October that it was shutting down its Questions product. Like LinkedIn Answers, Facebook Questions never managed to replace Quora, which had around 1.5 million monthly visitors as of last July. Mashable composite. Photo via iStockphoto, digitalhallway "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/risk-genetic-privacy/,The Risk of Handing Over Your Genome,"If you contribute your genome sequence anonymously to a scientific study, that data might still be linked back to you, according to a study published today in the journal Science. The researchers behind the study found they could deanonymize genomic data using only publicly available Internet information and some clever detective work. The study points to rising issues concerning genetic privacy and the need for better legal protection against genetic discrimination, experts say, since such a technique could reveal a person's propensity to a particular disease. The work also shows that study participants need to be better educated about the risks of joining genetic research efforts. Open-access data sets of human genomic information are an important resource for researchers trying to uncover the genetic basis of human disease. The 1000 Genomes Project, for example, is a publicly available catalog of variation in humans that researchers can use to identify mutations that cause disease risk in certain populations.  Researchers use this kind of open database much more often than controlled access sources, the National Institutes of Health said in a response to today's findings. ""Our last intention is to push these resources behind some firewall, says Yaniv Erlich, a geneticist at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and senior author on the study. ""We are in favor of public data sharing, but we need to think about how it could be misused and describe that correctly to people."" While the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 offers people some protection against employers or health insurers discriminating against them based on their genetics, life insurers and disability insurers are not prevented from using such information in their decisions. ""We have no comprehensive genetic privacy law,"" says Jeremy Gruber, a lawyer and president of the Council for Responsible Genetics. ""People need to be much better informed of the lack of privacy protections we have for genetic information,"" says Gruber. In the long run, says Erlich, it is better for these potential breaches to be demonstrated by a friendly investigator rather than someone who really wants to exploit the data. ""That would really undermine the public trust,"" he says. This isn't the first time privacy risks have been highlighted for public genome databases. Different groups have shown that with a second DNA sample, an individual's genetic information could be pulled out of what was thought to be anonymous ""pooled"" genomic data or gene activity databases. But Erlich's team used only knowledge of genetic markers and Internet detective work to identify nearly 50 people in public genomic data sets. Erlich, a former computer security researcher, was once hired by banks and other businesses to test their computer systems. For the DNA sleuthing, Erlich and his team used free genealogical databases that link surnames with genetic markers, called short tandem repeats, on the Y chromosome. There is no known biological function for these repeats, but the length and number are commonly used in ancestry research because, like surnames, those patterns are typically passed from father to son. Once the team found a link between the Y chromosome repeats in the genomic databases and potential surnames, they used other pieces of demographic information, such as date and place of birth, which are included in some of the genomic databases, and public records to identify donors. Eric Green, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, and other employees of the NIH acknowledge that Erlich's study highlights vulnerabilities in these research projects. To mitigate future risks, they write in the response published in Science, the NIH has decided to ""shift age information, which had been available for some of the participants on the repository's public web site, into controlled-access portions of the resource."" In addition to recruiting people who think the societal and medical research benefits of participating in genomic research outweigh the risks, better legal protection is key, says George Church, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School and founder of the Personal Genome Project, an open-access database of genomic and health data.  While there may be ways to make the data more secure, ""for every lock there is going to be a countermeasure, and I think that's a game that's just not worth playing,"" says Church. ""Much better is coming up with a protocol where you don't need any locks,"" he says, which would include better legal protection and education for study participants. Today's findings emphasize the need for public representation in the oversight of data collection, says Wylie Burke, a clinical geneticist at the University of Washington in Seattle.  ""Information should be readily available to the public concerning the oversight procedures in place, the research purposes for which data are being used, the outcomes of data uses, and, of course, how any misuses of data have been handled,"" she says. ""Without this kind of approach, we could see increasing mistrust of the research process."" Photo courtesy of Flickr, UC Davis College of Engineering

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/rolling-stone-ipad-app/,Hell Freezes Over as Rolling Stone Finally Releases iPad App,"Magazine publisher Wenner Media dismissed the idea of tablet publishing two years ago. On Thursday, the group finally launched an iPad app for music magazine Rolling Stone. The magazine costs $19.99 on an annual basis or $1.99 on a monthly recurring basis. A single copy of one magazine is available for $4.99, although those wishing to simply try out the magazine can do so with a one-month free trial. Although Rolling Stone has been available digitally on Zinio, Kindle and Nook in the past, the iPad launch is significant for a few of reasons. The release marks the first time a native version of Rolling Stone has been available on Newsstand. It also indicates that publisher Wenner Media has mellowed in its approach to the iPad. In an interview with AdAge less than two years ago, Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner slammed magazine publishers for their ""premature"" embrace of the iPad, something he said was driven by ""sheer insanity, insecurity and fear."" As with the print magazine, the Rolling Stone iPad edition promises breaking music news, album and movie reviews and more. One additional feature is iTunes integration, so readers can link directly to songs or albums mentioned in articles. The bad news is that, unlike some other magazine publishers, Wenner Media does not offer a discount or bonus features to existing print subscribers. They, like everybody else, will be forced to subscribe to the digital edition. Image via Rolling Stone, Apple Newsstand

How well do you know Lochte? The swimmer hosted a Twitter Q&A Thursday afternoon, using the hashtag #AskLochte, and things got a little out of control. Ok, actually the interview session was fairly quick and normal. But we've re-imagined the questions to give this Internet pool party a little pizzaz. Do you want to play a game of Lochte Jeopardy? Jeah, you do.  SEE ALSO: 8 Cute Animals Model Ryan Lochte's Sunglasses If you really want to know the answers, simply highlight the space under each of Lochte's tweeted answers. Contestants, take your marks. Go!   BONUS: 10 Things Social Media Tells Us About Ryan Lochte   A quick look at Twittercounter.com shows just how enamored the world has become with Mr. Lochte since the Games began. Last Friday, the day of the Opening Ceremony, he had about 140,000 Twitter followers. This Friday, his 28th birthday, he's at about 650,000. For those scoring at home that's an increase of well over half a million Twitter followers. Jeah, as the saying the goes. Lochte and Phelps have maintained a cordial and upbeat public Twitter correspondence during the Olympics before and after going head to head in high stakes races. That's not surprising, considering the two are teammates for the U.S. swim team, but still kind of nice given that Lochte came to London looking to supplant Phelps as America's swimming idol. Jeah! Not sure what that means? Lochte stars in this handy YouTube video, which teaches you how to use the phrase to express a range of emotions including extreme, casual and moderate approval. Lochte gets a lot of credit for being engaging on Twitter, and his mother set the social network ablaze this week when she told NBC's ""Today"" about his tendency toward ""one night stands."" But a moderately close look at Lochte's Twitter profile further reveals his appreciation of the fairer sex -- he's got a particular propensity for retweeting compliments and shout-outs from attractive female followers, of which he has plenty. You know how Gary Busey always says stuff that doesn't make any sense at all, but then it actually kind of does? That's how Lochte is with motivational sayings. Check the example at left for proof. If the swimming thing, you know, doesn't work out Lochte might want to consider a career in online media. He has ninja-like skill when it comes to skirting image copyright issues. His secret? Take photos of TVs. It's brilliant. The image at left is one example, as is his Twitter profile pic. Among Lochte's arsenal of taglines is the unity-inspiring hashtag #LochteNation. It's populated by ""Lochtenators,"" in case you were wondering. Ten days or so before the Olympics started, Lochte used his Facebook Page to share with fans a photo of him and ""best friend/teammate Cullen Jones having an authentic French lunch today!"" Lochte's review? French cuisine is ""definitely different and not exactly 'training' food,"" but nonetheless they had a good time. Lochte's popularity isn't limited just to American- based social networks such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. On the Chinese service Sina Weibo, he has nearly 70,000 followers. Among the 14 brands Lochte Likes on Facebook is Mutual of Omaha insurance, proving that he knows the concept of better safe than sorry. What's that, you say...Mutual of Omaha is one of his sponsors.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/smartphone-app-detect-skin-cancer/,Can a Smartphone App Really Detect Skin Cancer?," Your smartphone may be great for getting the latest movie listings and even providing directions to get you to the theater, but how well can it help you detect skin cancer? Not so well, according to researchers at the University of Pittsburgh. Their study, published in JAMA Dermatology, found that ""the performance of smartphone applications in assessing melanoma risk is highly variable, and three of four smartphone applications incorrectly classified 30% or more of melanomas as unconcerning."" The researchers say relying on the app instead of having a medical consultation often delays the diagnosis and can potentially harm users. They looked at four smartphone apps that evaluate melanoma, a potentially life-threatening form of skin cancer.  The apps work by having the user take a picture of a suspicious mole. Some of the apps were free, others charged a small fee, and the ones that actually send the image to a physician to evaluate cost $5. Dr. Laura Ferris, a dermatologist and co-author of the study, along with her colleagues, evaluated photos of close to 200 moles to test four different skin cancer apps. Three of them provided instant diagnosis via algorithm, while one sent the mole image to a board-certified dermatologist for review. Those results often took up to 24 hours to get back. Ferris reports the highest-performing of the instant apps missed 30% of the melanoma cases, while the worst-performing missed 93%. The app that used actual physicians to diagnose the melanomas worked well, correctly identifying more than 98% of the submitted images. The researchers didn't name the apps they tested in the study. SEE ALSO: The Virtual Doctor Will See You Now Via HealthSpot Ferris writes she's concerned a misdiagnosis can cause harm to patients, especially those who might not have medical insurance. ""This potential is of particular concern in times of economic hardship, when uninsured and even insured patients, deterred by the cost of copayments for medical visits, may turn to these applications as alternatives to physician evaluation.""  The idea of an app to evaluate a mole may be appealing to many users. Often times getting an appointment with a dermatologist can take days, if not weeks, and not everyone knows what to look for. With apps that help us measure our heart rate and glucose level and track daily caloric intake, one would think an app to evaluate the symmetry of a mole would be advantageous. But Ferris says, in this instance, nothing really replaces the eyes of a trained doctor. ""Reliance on these applications, which are not subject to regulatory oversight, in lieu of medical consultation can delay the diagnosis of melanoma and harm users.""  However, since the app that used board-certified doctors to examine the moles correctly diagnosed the melanoma 98% of the time, perhaps virtual medical kiosks like the HealthSpot, and other telehealth options, will make skin cancer detection easier in the future. For now, it seems, for detecting skin cancer —there's not an app for that.  Photo via Joe Raedle/Getty Images "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/star-wars-tech/,10 Star Wars Technologies We Actually Want,"Yes, androids are dangerous, they'll inevitably revolt and kill us all, blah blah blah. But let's not forget the true heroes of Star Wars -- C-3PO and R2-D2. The droid duo saved their human companions and the galaxy itself on multiple occasions. At least, R2 did. That feisty little bucket was fiercely loyal, full of gizmos and had a universal port for accessing every computer terminal in the galaxy (except maybe Lightning connectors). Meanwhile, C-3PO speaks 6 million languages. He's a walking, talking universal translator and his storytelling skills (and general harmlessness) would make him a hit with kids (and Ewoks).  Image courtesy of Flickr, Andres Rueda Spoiler Alert: When Luke was ""disarmed"" at the end of The Empire Strikes Back, it could have been a debilitating, rebellion-ending injury. But thanks to the subtly miraculous technology of his universe, he had 10 fingers again within 10 minutes. Aside from the vanity glove he wore in Return of the Jedi, and the fact that he was probably a wicked efficient high-fiver after that, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  Also, let's not forget that Darth Vader, who bested Luke in lightsaber combat, was more machine than man. Pretty spry for a metal guy. Wouldn't it be nice if injured veterans and victims of disfiguring accidents could count on bionic limbs to make them whole again? Image courtesy of Flickr, euthman ""An elegant weapon for a more civilized age."" The lightsaber is the most captivating and enduring creation of the Star Wars saga. Yeah, they're cool. But come on. Do we really need them? Earthlings haven't fought wars with swords in a while. And the last thing we'd want to give a sci-fi superfan is a white-hot blade that can cut through anything. There are dozens of lightsaber battles on YouTube, and no one had to worry about getting cut in half in the process of filming.  But how's this for elegant and civilized? Last year, a research team at the University of Texas at Austin debuted a tiny, laser-based cutting tool. The device, which drew comparisons to the Skywalker weapon of choice, may someday replace scalpels. Years of clinical trials separate it from mass production, but aspiring Jedi should take note: you will think about medical school. Image courtesy of Flickr, Chris Makarsky Maybe not the most glamorous tech in the series, but the moisture farm where Luke Skywalker grew up would be a modern miracle. The future Jedi and his family made a living on a desert world by harvesting excess moisture out of the air. Think of the work that could be done to combat drought with real-world moisture vaporators.  A researcher at the Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne clearly had the same idea; he developed his own vaporator system that could be used to irrigate plants in the harshest deserts on Earth. By lowering the temperature of moisture-rich air, his simple system collects condensation and creates water. No word yet on its programming language, but we can assume it will be very similar to binary load lifters in most respects.  Image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons, Veronique Debord No, not the cheesy CNN kind. Researchers at MIT's MediaLab visited Mashable last year and promised something a bit more portable and space-age. MIT's Joi Ito speculated about holograms transported via the Internet and projected by a device comparable in size to R2-D2. Never mind Google Hangouts -- this could be the future of telecommuting. We know, traveling through hyperspace isn't exactly like dusting crops. But is it too much to ask for at least a Millennium Falcon prototype by 2020?

 Never mind going to space. Let's just focus on terrestrial travel for now. Can you name all the speedy hovercraft in the Star Wars universe? Luke had a pretty sweet ride for such a whiny kid. But we're not just talking about putting landspeeders in every teenager's driveway. Think about the broader applications of anti-gravity technology. The U.S. is overdue for a cross-country high-speed rail line, like the mag-lev prototype unveiled in Japan last year, or the line that recently opened in China. If you can throw smugglers in a carbon freezer and all they get is a little hibernation sickness, just think about the uses for carbonite around the house. To be clear, no, we're not talking about the online backup software. Almost half of the food produced in the U.S. goes to waste, uneaten. If the government would look into carbon freezing, maybe we could preserve some of that food (like tibanna gas on Bespin) and send it somewhere it's needed. Image courtesy of Flickr, offwhitehouse Of all the tech in Star Wars, we probably need the least innovation in the cause of actually making war. Drones are already fighting our battles from the skies. Would it be even better to put metal boots on the ground? The battle droids from The Phantom Menace were played for comedic effect, but it's not hard to imagine the U.S. would phase out human soldiers in favor of droids if that technology were available. What if we could go to war without risking American lives? It certainly sounds like a better idea than breeding an army of expendable clones, like in Episode II. Image courtesy of Flickr, steevithak In Episode I, we all learned that the Force was in fact not hokey religious nonsense, but hokey science-based nonsense. Tiny, microscopic organisms called midi-chlorians were at the root of the mystical energy field. The more midi-chlorians you have, the better your chances of cultivating your Force powers. Makes sense, right? The Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn had a handy little device for measuring midi-chlorians. So why can't we have one of those to test our own Jedi-ness? And, uh, do other science stuff too.

 A long time ago — well, last Friday — the White House struck down a petition for a real Death Star on its We the People site. In one swift stroke, the Obama administration Force-choked any politically active nerd's greatest dream: seeing that technological terror floating beside our lame, forest-free moon.  OK, so maybe building a Death Star was always going to be impossible, even for a computer. Still, Star Wars is a treasure trove of tech richer than the salt mines of Kessel. All those ideas are just waiting to be exploited and transformed into reality.  Some Star Wars tech has already made its way from a galaxy far away to this one: modern toys can simulate the Force itself.   But what futuristic space stuff could the government do well to investigate further? Here are 10 technologies that deserve petitions of their own, for the betterment of mankind.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/temple-run-2-review/,'Temple Run 2' Is Necessary and Beautiful,"Welcome to 'Temple Run 2,' released a little more than a year after the original blockbuster game. Temple Run 2 features the same swipe controls as the original, making the gameplay easy for anyone to pick up. This new game is a huge graphical improvement over the original Temple Run. The world is set on a floating temple, and the game takes place just before sunset; the clouds look like sherbet.  The game has far more obstacles than before, so you'll be jumping and ducking a variety of natural and dangerous formations. Want to feel like Tarzan? Temple Run 2 loves sending you down zip lines and over vines. You'll also have to tilt the phone to stay on these rickety minecart tracks, another new feature. Instead of running from a horde of angry monkeys, your new monkey foe is huge, and scary. Don't let him catch you! After each death, Temple Run 2 offers you the option to revive and not lose your spot in your run. You can do this if you've snagged a gem during your runs, but you can also purchase them from the store. The game's store has a multitude of coin purchase options to get new characters and power-ups earlier, as well as gems to revive your character. You can level up your character's abilities with the coins you collect. Just like Temple Run, you level up your character by completing objectives in-game. You'll also get different messages at the end of your run, depending on how you died. Each Temple Run 2 character includes his or her own special power than can be activated during runs. While many may say, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it,"" this is not true for Temple Run 2. The original was a smash hit, downloaded more than 170 million times across iOS and Android devices, but there remained a lot to be improved upon in the game. Temple Run 2 [iTunes link] represents those improvements, proving that the development team of Imangi Studios took a lot of time to add more depth into this mega-addictive endless runner.  First off, the game is far more beautiful than its predecessor. Imangi cofounder Keith Shepherd said they added two members to the team specifically to make Temple Run 2 as beautiful as possible. The effort paid off: The game takes place in as lush of a game world as you can get on an iPhone, and it definitely takes advantage of Retina displays. The cloud-swathed, floating temple is surrounded by the pink sky of the ""golden hour"" that occurs before sunset.  The environments are also more varied, along with the obstacles. As soon as you start mastering the early terrain, Temple Run 2 switches it up on you, driving you deeper into dense woods full of ill-placed spike traps. Further down still is a perilous mine shaft, and you'll have to keep racing through to escape. Each area is interesting and full of nicely illustrated detail. Even the menacing monkey chasing you has benefitted from a graphical upgrade. Instead of a pack of tiny primates, you're now being chased by one giant ape. Seeing his figure behind you as you race and turn is good motivation to keep going. While many things have improved, the simple control scheme didn't, and that's a great thing. The best thing about the Temple Run franchise is it's easy to pick up, yet hard to master the game. It's the key to what made the original such a success, and it will help propel the second to great heights. Temple Run 2 also beefed up the characters available to the player. Shepherd said they found there were enough fans who wanted a real differentiation between all the avatars, so the developer obliged by adding different power-ups to each. They don't add as much depth to the gameplay as advertised, but still are nice for players who favor one character over another. The characters and power-ups can all be purchased with real money as well as in-game currency. This is something we've come to expect from freemium games. My one gripe, representative of the freemium formula being taken too far in Temple Run 2, is how the game handles your eventual death. Now, when your character falls off the edge or smacks his head into a wall, a small dialogue box appears, crying ""Save Me!"" Reviving your character costs one gem, and while they are sporadically available as you race through the game, five can be purchased for just 99 cents. It's an easy way to cheat death, but it could also easily be an addictive way to stretch your runs just a little farther. Just let me buy the game for a dollar so I don't have to see this, please? Despite this drawback, I can see Temple Run 2 reaching the same success as the first game based on its improvements. I'm looking forward to seeing every mobile screen on New York's subway taken up by this game — a real sign of its success.  For the price (free), iOS gamers cannot skip this one.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/temple-run-2/,'Temple Run 2' Swings Onto App Store,"The sequel to the explosively popular Temple Run is out Thursday morning for iPhone and iPad.  Temple Run took players on a jungle adventure as they attempted to escape from a horde of demonic monkeys with a stolen idol from a ancient temple. Players had to jump, dodge and duck under obstacles with swipes on the touch screen as they ran for their lives. The endless runner was downloaded more than 170 million times from Apple's App Store and Google Play since its 2011 release; 2.5 million of those downloads were on Christmas Day of 2012 as people unwrapped new mobile devices to game on.  Imangi Studios sprung Temple Run 2 on fans with little announcement or fanfare prior to its launch. Studio cofounder Keith Shepherd says the game is more of what fans loved, but with a depth his team wasn't able to add to the first game. ""We wanted to set out and do all the things we wanted to do with Temple Run but we couldn't fit in,"" Shepherd says. ""It feels like a bigger, better, more awesome version of the first game."" Temple Run was developed in five months by Shepherd, his wife and Imangi cofounder Natalia Luckyanova, and graphic designer Kiril Tchangov. Shepherd says he was inspired by games like Sonic the Hedgehog and the platforming of Mirror's Edge. But mostly, he wanted to see an endless runner in 3D; earlier games released in the genre, like Canabalt, were only two-dimensional games.  Temple Run 2 greatly expands on the first game's concepts, according to Shepherd. The game now takes place in a floating temple in the clouds. Players are confronted with new obstacles, like swinging from zip lines and riding in a rickety mine cart. ""The world you're running in is much more rich and vibrant,"" Shepherd says. ""There are curves and hills and valleys and stairs."" The new game also adds more things for players to do and collect, including characters that have their own specialized powers. The power meter is a new element to the series. ""Our fans have been fantastic and have given us great ideas and feedback,"" Shepherd says. ""People always wanted more out of the game. It was so easy to unlock everything, so we're glad we can offer a lot more for this one."" Temple Run 2 is available now for iPhone and iPad for free. The team says Android versions will be coming out soon. Image courtesy of Imangi "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/17/tesla-electric-car/,How the Tesla Electric Car Actually Works,"The Tesla Model S has been hailed as both a must-have big boy toy for the well-moneyed as well a harbinger of environmentally friendly transportation tech. So well-regarded are Tesla's electric cars, in fact, that the Model S was voted the Motor Trend Car of 2013. But how do Tesla's electric cars actually work? That answer requires a bit more explanation. The basics are pretty straightforward, but real intrigue lies in the details of its futuristic car tech.  Electricity charges a battery to give the Model S juice for a certain period of time, not unlike your smartphone or laptop. In fact, each Tesla electric car has much more in common with your MacBook than you might think — the company uses lithium-ion batteries just like the type that powers laptops worldwide.  There's just one difference — Tesla's batteries are a heck of a lot more powerful. The battery in each Tesla car is actually made up of thousands of lithium-ion cells that have a combined weight of about a thousand pounds, according to the company. Each pack is built at Tesla's Bay Area headquarters and comes equipped with a heating system that enables the car to function in cold weather.  To get that battery ready to roll, however, you're going to have to charge the sucker. Again, this process isn't much different from the way you charge the portable devices you carry around every day — what's unique here is you're dealing with a much bigger gadget that carries you around instead. And this is the key difference between a Tesla electric car and a hybrid, like the Toyota Prius — it's all electric and has to be charged, whereas the Prius runs partially on gasoline but doesn't have to be charged.   There are a few ways to go about charging your Tesla electric car. Tesla recommends getting an electrician to install a recharging station at your home. Called a High Power Wall Charger, this device plugs into the back of the car and can juice its battery twice as fast as a 120-volt outlet would. You can also plug in to 100-volt outlets via a mobile connector that allows you to charge wherever you find time and electricity. And, of course, you could always go green by installing solar panels to generate charge at home.  But that's not all — Tesla is also in the process of installing hundreds of ""supercharging"" stations on highways across the United States and in parts of Canada. These stations are designed to allow Model S owners to charge their rides in just about an hour, and several have already been built in California.   So what does all that electricity get used for? To power a watermelon-sized motor that converts mechanical power into electricity but also turns that mechanical power into more electricity. It's a much simpler, more efficient device than the combustion engine found in most cars, enabling you to get the most mileage for your charge. Tesla says its electric cars equipped with the most powerful battery packs available can travel at 55 miles per hour for up to 300 miles on a single charge.  Of course, eventually you'll run out of juice and the whole process will begin again. But now you'll have an appreciation for how the Tesla electric car actually works.

The 3.9-pound Chromebook includes an 11-inch anti-glare display with 1366 x 786 resolution, a webcam, three USB ports, as well as both HDMI and VGA ports. Lenovo didn't specify the name of its Intel processor or the device's battery life, though it claimed the device lasts the duration of a school day.  The device is designed to withstand students' wear and tear, featuring a rubber bumper, reinforced corners, and hinges that have been tested to withstand 50,000 opens and closes.

Yelp, the popular business review website, announced Thursday that it has started adding hygiene scores for restaurants in San Francisco and there are plans to add similar scores to restaurants in New York next.  The hygiene scores, which are on a 100-point scale, are based on inspection data from the city and a standard developed in partnership with local and federal government officials. Yelp is working with the technology departments of the cities of San Francisco and New York to collect and add this information into its database. ""While ratings and reviews are incredibly powerful ways to guide spending decisions, we're always looking for new ways to supplement the information to provide a better experience for consumers,"" Yelp's co-founder and CEO Jeremy Stoppelman said in a statement.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/aaron-swartz-law-is-only-beginning/,Congresswoman: 'Aaron's Law' to Honor Aaron Swartz Is Only the Beginning,"'Aaron's Law' is just the beginning of a more exhaustive reform of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), a law being used to prosecute Internet activist and hacker Aaron Swartz, said Democratic California Rep. Zoe Lofgren in an interview with Mashable. ""The statute, which was adopted in 1986, needs a whole, complete overhaul,"" Lofgren said in a phone interview. ""But that's likely to take a very long time. So I'm very keen to work on a complete overhaul while on a parallel track, I'm hopeful we can make these discreet changes."" On Tuesday evening, Lofgren posted the one-page bill on Reddit. Under her proposal, the violation of online terms of service would stop being a felony. Some legal experts have said Lofgren's changes don't address what they see as other flaws of the CFAA. Lofgren is aware of those criticisms, but she wants to put this minor change ahead of more comprehensive reform. She's hoping this will take less time.  ""I'm hopeful we can proceed promptly to make these discreet changes to prevent any other person from being tortured the way Aaron was,"" Lofgren said. Lofgren's proposal, legal experts say, might come up short. They think that the main problem of the CFAA is that it lacks a clear definition of authorized access. Under the current law, prosecutors have a lot of leeway to charge hackers even in cases when all they did was get a hold of public information.  Lofgren knows of the limitations of the proposal. That's why she posted it on Reddit before introducing it to the House, looking for feedback and suggestions. ""We're looking at what other elements could be included, if any, that would have basically prevented the indictment that Aaron faced,"" she said. Swartz, a prominent Internet freedom activist, committed suicide on Friday, Jan. 11 in his Brooklyn apartment. At the time of his death he was awaiting trial for allegedly illegally downloading millions of scholarly articles over the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's network. He was facing up to 35 years in prison and $1 million in fines.  His family, along with some of his friends and supporters, believe the charges against him, and an overzealous prosecution led by U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, contributed to his decision to commit suicide. A White House online petition to remove Ortiz reached 25,000 signatures on Tuesdsy. In response, Ortiz released a statement saying the conduct of her office was ""appropriate"" and that they never intended to ask for maximum sentence. Lofgren refused to comment on the prosecution's behavior, arguing that that's not the role of a member of Congress, and instead went back to the CFAA.  ""I'll just say this, if the statute allowed multiple felony charges to be lodged for what Aaron Swartz did, the statute should be changed,"" said Lofgren. SEE ALSO: After Aaron Swartz: The Tech World Must Talk About Depression
 Lofgren has been at the forefront of Internet freedom issues in Congress for years, always involved — and sometimes leading — reforms that intended to tackle outdated laws on copyright, privacy and other Internet-related issues. She was one of the most prominent critics and opponents of the much-maligned Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), and she thinks there's still much work to do. But for that, she says, the online community needs to step it up once more.  ""The SOPA fight showed what can happen in terms of stopping bad legislation when people are armed with information and speak up to the legislator,"" she said, referring to the popular online uprising that led to Internet giants like Wikipedia and Google to join the protest. ""The question is can people armed with information speaking to the legislator not only stop bad things from happening but make good things happen. And that's yet to be proven, we'll see."" Lofgren hopes that can turn out to be true in the following months, when she will introduce 'Aaron's Law' to the House, start working on an overhaul of the CFAA, domain seizure reform and re-introduce the Electronic Communications Privacy Act 2.0, which she introduced it in late September. The aim of the bill is to introduce the same email privacy protections that were finally stripped out of the so-called Netflix bill, which passed at the end of the year.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/airpano-new-york/,Take an Incredible Bird's-Eye Tour of Manhattan,"There's been a lot of buzz about the above photo over the past week. The stunning shot of Manhattan, taken from a unique ""bird's-eye"" perspective, is part of panoramic photo project called AirPano. Essentially, it's Google Street View from the air — viewers can virtually access the entire island, from Battery Park up to Washington Heights.  Take a look at it here:
  It's arranged into a number of pre-programmed tours. To start, click on one of the white arrow icons. If you choose ""Times Square at Night,"" for example, you're instantly flown down through the iconically bright intersection. Once the tour ends, and you've seen everything there is to see, you're back at the top and free to choose another one.  Serge Semenov, the project's founder, created the tour by stitching together thousands of pictures from a helicopter trip in 2011. He says on his website: The desire to share my impressions with those who can't travel due to different circumstances led me to the project AirPano.com. The sense of the project itself is to show the people the most beautiful places of our planet in the manner that nobody has ever seen them before: from the bird's-eye view with unlimited freedom of vision and movement
 It's not just the Big Apple, either. Semenov has created similar aerial panoramas for a number of other destinations, including the Taj Mahal, Niagara Falls and the Christ the Redeemer Statue in Rio de Janeiro.   Here's a tour of Paris:
  A few other still images from Semenov's New York tour — particularly, this one taken directly above Central Park — even made it to the front page of Reddit last week.

If you're Al Gore, you go ahead and make another small fortune from Apple stock. Gore, who holds a position as a director on Apple's board, exercised options to purchase 59,000 shares of Apple stock on Jan. 15 for the insanely low price of $7.475 a share, according to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. Based on Apple's current share price of about $500, Gore effectively purchased $29.5 million worth of Apple stock for just $441,000. That's a pretty big discount and one that Gore probably doesn't need. Less than two weeks earlier, Gore announced that his media company Current TV had been acquired by Al-Jazeera for a reported $500 million. Gore is said to have had a 20% stake in the company, which means he made $100 million and Forbes estimates that his total fortune is now $300 million. It sure is good to be Al right now.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/armstrong-tweet-mistake/,Armstrong Says Infamous Yellow Jersey Tweet Was a 'Mistake',"In Part 2 of Oprah Winfrey's exclusive interview with Lance Armstrong, the disgraced athlete said a defiant tweet he posted last fall was a ""mistake."" After the USADA stripped the seven-time Tour de France winner of all his titles and banned him from sports for life over charges of taking banned performance-enhancing drugs and blood doping, Armstrong tweeted to his followers a phot of him lying on the couch in his basement, surrounded by the framed yellow jerseys from his seven wins (shown below). Winfrey asked him if that was the ""cocky, arrogant jerk self"" that Armstrong described in Part 1 of the interview. Armstrong, wincing at the question, said the tweet was ""more defiance"" and ""another mistake."" He later called it ""dumb."" SEE ALSO: Lance Armstrong Interview Stirs Outrage on Social Media
 When Armstrong first sent the tweet in early November, it immediately went viral. It was viewed more than 300,000 times in two days, and was retweeted 8,000 times.  The picture sparked plenty of reaction, much of it negative, as well as at least one parody pic that showed Armstrong surrounded by posters of pills and hypodermic needles. In the previous month, Armstrong had erased any mention of his Tour de France wins from his Twitter bio. What was your reaction to the tweet, and what do you think of Armstrong's admission it was a mistake? Share your thoughts in the comments.  "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/asb-glassfloor/,Check Out the Sports Floor From the Future,"Imagine a runner on a track with a glowing marker that follows her, showing speed and time. Or a tennis court that shows for sure whether the ball was out, or even a basketball court floor that runs ads during half time. Those are some of the possibilities with a glass floor designed by German company ASB Systembau GMBH. ASB supplies glass squash courts, and now has moved into smart flooring. SEE ALSO: With LED Keyboards, Every Key Is A Screen
 The company developed the Tron-like floor above after it noted that the glass on the squash courts, which is translucent rather than transparent, could be combined with lighting to make moveable lines that would be invisible when unlit. That led to the ASB Glassfloor, which has already been installed in a German school's athletics complex. The floor itself is an aluminum frame that supports the glass, which is tempered to resist breakage, which means the panels can be much larger and thinner for their size than traditional glass floor tiles, like the ones made famous by Saturday Night Fever. The surface is etched to prevent stray reflection, so players won't get blinded. In addition, to get that particular friction — the ""feel"" of a traditional parquet floor — the glass is covered with tiny ceramic dots. Instead of painting lines on a wooden surface, the floor uses a layer of LEDs underneath the glass. The LEDs can be in the form of boundary lines for different sports, or can serve as a display. This system eliminates the problem of painting multiple lines on the floor for different sports. The glass floor is also, ASB says, more durable than wood. SEE ALSO: Hack Yourself a Super Secret LCD Monitor
 But forget just being able to adjust a floor for current sports: The ability to put lines on the floor means you can design games that use them as barriers or guides. A ""smart"" ball could sound off when a barrier is hit, for instance. Or lights could track players and show if they are off-sides or out of bounds. The future of sporting events just got a little more exciting.  Photo courtesy of ASB

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/baseball-star-catfishing/,Te'o'd: Baseball Star Shares His Own Catfishing Tale,"By now it's the sports story you've heard a million times online: Manti Te'o, a college football star for Notre Dame, gains widespread attention and adulation for his stellar play this season despite the death of his girlfriend.  There's just one catch: Lennay Kekua, the supposed girlfriend, never existed. She was an online construct, created largely through a cobbled-together set of social media profiles.  Some believe Te'o was in on the hoax, using the incredible story to boost his campaign for a Heisman Trophy he nearly won. Other believe he was the unwitting victim of an elaborate ""catfishing"" scam — so named for the documentary Catfish, which delves into the world of duplicitous fake online romances.  But while Te'o may have taken the bait hook, line and sinker, he's not the only star college athlete to be targeted by fake online paramours. The attempted scam may be much more common than originally thought, according to a blog post recently shared by a minor league pitcher and former college baseball hero.  Michael Roth led the University of South Carolina to the 2010 College World Series and was drafted by the Anaheim Angels in the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft. Shortly after his ascent to stardom in the 2010 series, he writes, a mysterious young woman contacted him and initiated an extended series of bizarre electronic contact.  She thought he was cute, she said, and she'd seen him pitch. She'd text him and they spent time talking on the phone. She said her name was Hope Porter and she attended the University of Texas. She sent photos, ostensibly of herself, showing a cute blonde. They were supposed to meet up in person once, but she flaked at the last minute.  Eventually, Roth Googled her phone number. Results showed up in a number of chat rooms, where other men related similar stories — a girl from Texas named Hope Porter, who led them on with flirtatious correspondences.  ""The guys in the chat room said they had confronted her about it,"" Roth writes. ""She said it was her Uncle.  They pushed her further. Finally, she said she was initially doing a project to see if someone could fall in love over the phone. She was supposed to end it after a few months, but after talking with them for a while, she enjoyed it so much that she just kept doing it."" Roth finally made a call of his own and told the woman to leave him alone once and for all. So ended Roth's catfishing tale, which you can read in full here, but he says he's going to post a similar experience from one of his teammates soon.  Have you ever had a similar experience? Will ""catfishing"" become more common as online-based relationships continue to grow? Christian Petersen/Getty Images Sport "

You'll see ""Labs"" near the right side of the list. All images by Mashable, Alex Hazlett Scroll through the list of labs currently on offer and enable or disable each one. You'll need to save your preferences after you make changes. Now for the labs we like best... This does exactly what you'd expect. It moves your chat list from the left side of your inbox to the right. It may crunch your inbox, but if you widen your window (or use two monitors), you shouldn't have much of a problem.  Right-Hand Chat frees up valuable real estate on the left side for an extensive label list or other useful labs. With this lab, you get a snapshot of your day right in your inbox window. While it may not be the best tool for long-term planning, it does let you check your daily availability for that unforeseen meeting or coffee invitation. If you're like us, you probably have a few documents you refer to time and again. Docs Preview shows your recently accessed documents on the left, in your inbox window. You now have one-click access the next time you need to look something up, saving you the hassle of searching through your Drive. These two labs are particularly well-suited for anyone dealing with a shared mailbox, or who batch processes a ton of email.  Send & Archive files away your sent email and the originals, clearing out your inbox.  Auto-Advance lets you specify how you want Gmail to act after you've taken an action on an email. It can open up the next message or take you back to the inbox.  This is another useful tool for those who deal with a lot of repetitive email. You can save a generic response and insert it into new emails as necessary.  One caveat: When saving a new canned response, the program captures whatever is in the window, so you need to begin with a completely blank email. With all that email you get these days, it's easy to get buried. For those millions of you who use Gmail as your main email client, either for your personal email, or through work or school, allow us to make some suggestions.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/carbon-fiber-2014-corvette/,Carbon Fiber: The Secret of the 2014 Corvette Stingray," The Corvette has been redesigned only six times since its debut 50 years ago, so for the seventh version that it unveiled at the Detroit Auto Show this week, GM brought to bear some of its most advanced car technologies. A notable one: the addition of carbon fiber into the construction of the sports car. By using carbon fiber and replacing its steel frame with aluminum, the 2014 Corvette managed to shave 100 pounds off its weight, says Tadge Juechter, the executive chief engineer in charge of Corvette. The car is also 60% stiffer, he says. Carbon fiber makes up both the car's hood and roof panel, but composite materials also reduce the weight of the fenders, doors, rear quarter and underbody. SEE ALSO: See the Coolest Feature of the 2014 Corvette Stingray
 The interior design is treated with carbon fiber as well. Some of the paneling on the dashboard and doors has the telltale dual-tone gray markings, and running your fingers across it — feeling the smooth, stiff lines — is a dead giveaway. The seventh-generation Corvette isn't the first to have carbon fiber built into its design. The sixth-generation Corvette, which debuted in 2005, was upgraded with carbon-fiber fenders and front wheel houses in 2006. In 2009, carbon fiber spread to the roof panel as well. The new Corvette has a new LT1 V-8 engine capable of delivering 450 horsepower and 450 foot-pounds of torque. At the same time, GM says it's the most fuel-efficient Corvette ever made, rated at 26 miles per gallon (highway). Redesigning the car for its 50th anniversary cost GM a cool $131 million, the company claims. Homepage photo by Pete Pachal, Mashable The new Corvette features a top-to-bottom redesign of the iconic sports car. Now built out of aluminum and carbon fiber instead of steel, it's lighter and has more horsepower -- 450 to the 2013 model's 430. No price yet, but Chevy says it'll be in the neighborhood of current Corvettes with start around $50,000. The 2014 Corvette has a new logo as well. One of the more controversial aspects of the redesign is the back end, which ditches the circular tail lights that have been around since the first Corvette in 1953 for something more modern. The Stingray logo, not used since the 1970s, also got a makeover. The 2014 Corvette dashboard includes two HD screens, one of which retracts at the touch of a buttton. The interior design got a makeover, too, with ""adrenaline red"" seat coloring as an option. The Corvette has been redesigned only six times, for a grand total of seven generations of the car, including the 2014 model. This is the one that started it all. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/digital-natives-lessons-in-social-media/,Why Being Young Doesn't Make You a Social Media Expert,"Rebecca Levey is a co-founder of KidzVuz.com, a video review site by and for tweens. She writes about technology and education at Beccarama and is a White House Champion of Change for Education. Follow her at @beccasara. On the face of it, my 10-year-old twin daughters are the poster girls for the ""digital natives"" generation.  They've had a Leapster since age 4, and have been online since they were 5 — first playing on Webkinz, then Club Penguin, Moshi Monsters, and other online virtual worlds. They can navigate PowerPoint, Microsoft Word and Photoshop like pros. We had all the discussions I thought we needed to have — don't give out your password, don't give out personal information, report inappropriate behavior — and I keep their computers in the living room or kitchen where I can constantly look over their shoulders.  Being the digital mom I am, I thought I had covered all bases. But what I hadn't counted on was social media being an entirely different beast, and rendering my digitally savvy girls into digital Mr. Magoos.   I live a good deal of my life online. The ease with which I move between Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, blogs, chat and other social media is second nature and central to my work. It never occurred to me that my daughters would have no idea what they were doing when they entered the social media space. After all, for me it's just an extension of my ""real"" life.  But I quickly came to realize that of course is the crux of the issue when it comes to tweens and teens online: they are just starting to figure out what it means to be social in their real world. Adding in social media amplifies and intensifies all of the bumbling mistakes, mean girl tendencies and just out right naivitee. SEE ALSO: Parent's Dilemma: Are You Raising Tech-Addicted Kids?
 Over the past year I've watched my daughters and their friends set up email accounts, Instagram accounts and various chat apps on their newly acquired smartphones and iPods. It's clear that they are truly clueless. Emails are always ""reply all"" and sent to practically everyone in their address books — not to mention the crazy chain emails they send.  So, the first discussion I had to have with my daughters was about email protocol and etiquette — and to reassure them over and over again that someone they loved would not die if they didn't forward that email to 10 other people. It's actually not easy to convince a 10-year-old girl of this fact. Unfortunately, email was the most benign of our social media issues. The real problem is apps — specifically Instagram.  There's been a ton of press coverage about the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and the new focus on apps. However, that focus is all about marketing and behavioral tracking, not the real hazards of tweens using these apps — the ones parents are much more concerned about — and the social and psychological effects of over-sharing or just plain public stupidity.  Most parents I've spoken to don't even know that it's illegal for their kids to have an Instagram account if they're under 13. There's been so much attention paid to Facebook, but from what I'm seeing and hearing, it's all about Instagram for kids.  Parents who would never let their child have a Facebook account are completely fine with Instagram, basically because it hasn't gotten the same amount of publicity. The same is true for the popular chat apps like Kik Messenger, which kids are signing up for in droves. Some know to keep their accounts private, but many don't. All you have to do is read the reviews in the app store to see the completely inappropriate, sexual and predator behaviors going on with Kik.   SEE ALSO: A Parent's Take on Snapchat
 I would never hand my daughters the keys to the car when they turn 16 without having had some kind of driver's training — not to mention passing their driving test. Yet my girls have a supercomputer connected to the world in the palm of their hand every day, and no instruction manual. That had to change. This isn't about care and responsibility for the device, it's about having a social media playbook so they can understand the rules of the game and be as safe and smart as possible. Here are my social media rules for my girls:  Linked Accounts in iTunes:  At first I HATED that my account was on their iPod and every app they downloaded ended up on my device. Now, I am thankful for it.  They can't download any app in secret I'm their friend, literally: Instagram and elsewhere, if the app is social they have to friend me Privacy Please: There's no such thing as privacy online, but keeping their accounts private keeps strangers from following them without permission. However, it's incredibly important to tell your kids that NOTHING is private, ever. Screenshots are easy to take, and friends who aren't as careful can easily share your photos and texts The Talk: No taking naked pics. No passing on of naked pics of others if they land in your stream (my girls still don't understand why anyone would take naked pics, but they're 10.) And as my friend told her son when he got his first phone, no sticking it down your pants. A point worth making. Also, don't post pics of others without their permission, which technically a child under 13 can't give. The same personal info talk still applies â€“- no giving out addresses, names, schools, passwords and other identifiable ID Turn off location tracking. Period Know your child's device password And here's a really important one for parents: Don't allow connected devices at your child's parties, especially sleepovers. This is where so much trouble starts. Inevitably kids who weren't invited see pictures on Instagram and feel left out. There is also potential for the worst pictures to be taken and shared. And, it's a huge recipe for peer pressure to text kids of the opposite sex, entice mean girl behavior and worse. Tell parents that all devices must be left home, and have a basket in your room to keep devices that come with guests despite your best intent. It's not the worse thing in the world for kids to actually have to play games and have fun without electronics for one day. They can still get in plenty of the usual trouble, but at least there won't be a digital record of it Do your kids have a road map for good social media behavior and etiquette?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/four-must-have-features-mobile-app/,4 Features Every Brand's App Should Have,"Joe Chernov is the VP of marketing for Kinvey, a mobile back-end as a service startup in Cambridge, Mass. Joe joined Kinvey from Eloqua, where he served as VP of content marketing. The Content Marketing Institute named him ""Content Marketer of the Year"" in 2012. For brand marketers, the mobile app is becoming the new website. Just as websites evolved from being digital marketing collateral to interactive storefronts, the second generation of mobile apps is maturing into virtual a cash machine for brands.  Maybe that's why marketers are increasing their mobile budgets by 70% this year.  Mobile app measurement firm Flurry has found that consumers spend significantly more time interacting with mobile apps than browsing the web, and the company predicts app engagement may soon overtake television viewing. With apps cutting into time previously spent on marketing's most vital channels — web and television — it's little surprise brands are racing to build branded apps. Despite what would appear to be a winning combination of budget and revenues, however, many brand apps fail to gain traction. Certainly the sheer number of apps crowding the App Store and Google Play make it difficult for any app to get noticed, but insiders argue the larger issue is the quality of brand apps. ""Most (brand apps) fail because they try to do too much,"" says Chris Silva, a mobile technology analyst with Altimeter Group. If less is truly more when it comes to mobile apps, what are the essential features that should top every marketer's must-have list? Experts point to these four: 1. Smart Push
Push notifications, or alerts delivered through the app, should do more than signal when it's time to download an update. Today's ""smart"" push can connect people to brands by anticipating and meeting each user's needs. Effective uses of push take into account the user's behavior and location to supply messaging based on the individual's particular circumstance. Walgreens' mobile app, for example, lets users scan a prescription with their phone's camera to receive an alert when the order ready for pickup and when it's time to order a refill. The app's fill-and-remind notifications are consistent with the company's goal to ""help people get well and stay well,"" according to company spokesperson Mai Lee Ua. But a word of caution: overusing push notifications can backfire, so try to deliver value in every alert.  2. Local Context
For many brands, especially retailers, what matters most is location. The ability to provide customers with recommendations and offers based on their whereabouts is a killer feature for many marketers. Small Luxury Hotels of the World, a network of premium independent inns, published an app that suggests to travelers nearby points of interest based on their phone's GPS coordinates, accelerometer and compass. Grassroots marketing meets mobile tech in Michaels Stores' app, which lets crafters search and select upcoming events held at their local store.  3. Social Integration
Nearly every brand app includes social sharing capabilities. Most integrate with Facebook and Twitter, while others, like cosmetics giant Sephora, facilitate Pinterest ""pinning."" But for most apps, successful social sharing relies more on what is being shared than on where it's being shared. Users are unlikely to post your product for the sake of posting. They need to deliver or derive value from the act. The social sharing component of REI's Snow Report app centers on user value. By allowing users to publish their on-mountain whereabouts to public social networks and local messageboards, the app helps skiers and riders organize impromptu meet-ups on the slopes.  4. A Simple Commerce Engine
Every marketer knows that an increase in budget is met with a greater lift in expectations. Yet before marketers can generate revenue from their newly funded mobile apps, they must first capture their users' credit card information and then provide a frictionless path to purchase. Brands from Starbucks to Hungry Howies Pizza have mastered the science of mobile payments for simple transactions, but what about more considered purchases? Enter Converse. The company's Sampler app adheres to its promise of ""keeping it simple"" — users select a sneaker within the app, position it over their foot using the device's camera, snap a photo to try it on virtually, then, if they like how it looks, order it right through the app. One thing, done well. Although these four features may be the essential ingredients for an effective app, quality alone isn't always enough to ensure the project's success. The most popular apps also receive a heavy marketing push. The good news for brands is that the team responsible for developing the app is also the group for ensuring it gets promoted.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/foursquare-map/,Interactive Map Shows Worldwide Foursquare Check-In Data,"Foursquare introduced a mapping feature on Thursday that makes it easier to visualize check-in activity around the world.  The black-and-white interactive map lets Foursquare users search for any region by Zip code and zoom in to discover the density of check-ins in that area, based on data from the 500 million check-ins on the service. Aside from just being a cool feature, it shows the potential Foursquare has to use its massive amount of data to map out real-world activity and make recommendations to users about where to go next. ""What makes Foursquare Explore so powerful is that all those check-ins you see aren't just single points — they're links between all the other places people have been, too,"" the company said in a blog post announcing the feature. ""We like to think of it as our version of Google PageRank for the real world — we're working to understand the billions of invisible connections between places so we can make amazing recommendations."" Just imagine how effective it would be for the company to target restaurant recommendations to those who have just come from a concert based on where others have enjoyed eating after leaving that venue in the past. If Foursquare can harness all its data into these kind of recommendations, it could prove incredibly useful for attracting advertisers and boosting the company's revenues in the future.

Friday morning, Coulton tweeted that Glee had a version that sounded much like his.  Hey look, @gleeonfox ripped off my cover of Baby Got Back: bit.ly/WME9Ho. Never even contacted me. Classy. The tweet points to a YouTube link for ""Baby Got Back,"" presumably to be included in next week's episode of Glee, titled ""Sadie Hawkins Dance."" According to the GleeWikia, a new character sings this song on the show. Here's the uploaded version and Coulton's version, for comparison.   The copyright surrounding this song's use is tricky, since Coulton's version is already a cover. From his blog, he questions whether the Glee recording even used bits of his audio, saying ""to my ears, it sounds like it actually uses the audio from my recording — not the vocals obviously, but the instruments sound EXTREMELY similar. And I could swear I hear the duck quack [which Coulton included in his version] somewhere in the background there, though it's hard to say if that's just my ears expecting it."" One notch against Glee is that Coulton's version of the song changes a line from ""Mix-a-Lot's in trouble"" to ""Johnny C's in trouble."" The Glee recording posted on YouTube uses the ""Johnny C"" version. While Coulton said he isn't ready to comment to Mashable until he learns more about his legal options, he did ask for help on Twitter.  Any audio maestros want to investigate if the actual AUDIO is the same (aside from the vocals)? Sounds like it, but I need science. Intellectual property attorney David Ervin tells Mashable the rights to the recorded arrangement may belong to Coulton depending on which type of contract he obtained the cover rights under. Coulton's blog indicates he obtained the rights to ""Baby Got Back"" under a federally controlled statutory license, which anyone can obtain after the original artist publishes a song. It dictates that Coulton would probably have paid royalties for his recording. Ervin said Coulton was ""likely"" to retain rights to his original recording under this kind of use, but he couldn't say anything for sure without seeing Coulton's contract. Ervin also said Coulton's recording of ""Baby Got Back"" may stand on its own simply because of how transformative it is when compared to the original. While this can be subjective, there are legal precedents for this argument. In a 1994 case brought before the Supreme Court, rappers 2 Live Crew successfully proved that their version of ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" was transformative enough to not be considered an infringing use of Roy Orbison's original. It was a legal victory that protects musical derivation as fair use. There is also a small question of the Glee version's authenticity. The song isn't hosted by an official FOX YouTube account, but that account has posted only authentic Glee songs in the past. Fox hasn't responded to request for comment as of this writing. It's even more complicated that a previously unknown actor to the series is singing the song. UPDATE 4:29 p.m. One of our awesome commenters pointed out that the song is available in the Swedish iTunes store [iTunes link here]. It looks like the real deal. Listen to the songs above, and let us know in the comments what you think. Image courtesy of Flickr, Send me adrift. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/google-1-billion-uk-headquarters/,Google to Spend $1 Billion on UK Headquarters,"As one IT giant stumbles, another one rises. Reuters reports that Google is investing $1 billion in its new UK headquarters, just as Sony announced it would be selling its NYC headquarters for $1.1 billion,  The company purchased a 2.4 acre plot of land in London's Kings Cross Central development, where it plans to build a 1-million-square-foot office.  Once built, the office could be worth up to $1.6 billion, according to one of Reuters' sources.  ""This is a big investment by Google, we're committing further to the UK — where computing and the web were invented. It's good news for Google, for London and for the UK,"" said Google's Vice President for Northern and Central Europe Matt Brittin. Google already has a presence in London, in Victoria and Holborn districts, but it will move to the new headquarters once it's finished. The company plans to start the construction on the building in 2013, and the project should be completed in 2016.  This is not the first time Google has spent more than $1 billion on real estate. In December 2010, the company bought a 2.9-million-square-foot building at New York's 111 Eighth Avenue for a reported price of $1.9 billion. Investments such as these are easier to make, though, when you have $44.6 billion in cash as Google does. Photo courtesy of iStockphoto, zmeel "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/google-password-alternatives/,A Log-in Finger Ring? Google Working on Password Alternatives," The topic of passwords has made headlines in the past year — from high-profile hacks to web users repeatedly not picking the right ones — but Google has its sights set on making the login-process much more secure in the future.  How secure, you may ask? Consider logging into Gmail with a high-tech ring worn on your finger or a key card that plugs into your computer's USB port. As detailed in a research paper in IEEE Security & Privacy Magazine and reported on by Wired, Google is already looking into password alternatives in the form of passdevices. The initiatives have also been confirmed by Mashable. ""We're focused on making authentication more secure, and yet easier to manage. We believe experiments like these can help make login systems better,"" a Google spokesperson said.  SEE ALSO: Google CEO Says Facebook Is Doing a 'Really Bad Job' With Its Products
 Google is currently running a pilot program with USB cards called Yubikeys, which aims to get passwords off computers and the cloud. This means that instead of having Google accounts tied to text, they would be linked with an actual device. ""We'd like your smartphone or smartcard-embedded finger ring to authorize a new computer via a tap on the computer, even in situations in which your phone might be without cellular connectivity,"" Google said in its research paper. However, some may argue having a physical authentication device might be another thing you have to worry about not leaving home without. This also means if a card or ring is lost or stolen, it should immediately be reported. Another solution on Google's radar is a chip embedded within your smartphone. With close-range wireless, users could potentially tap the computer to unlock email or even just be within range. In the meantime, Google plans on implementing a system not linked to hardware or software so anyone with a supported browser. If you don't want to wait, Google's two-factor authentication sends your phone a log-in code whenever you access your account from an unfamiliar computer. Image via dra_schwartz "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/google-plus-48-countries/,Google+ iOS App Arrives in 48 More Countries,"Google has made its iOS application for Google+ available in 48 new countries and territories.  The full list of new countries is as follows: Albania, Anguilla, Barbados, Benin, Bermuda, Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cape Verde, Cayman Islands, Chad, Republic of Congo, Dominica, Fiji, Gambia, Grenada, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Kyrgyzstan, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Liberia, Macau, Malawi, Mauritania, Federated States of Micronesia, Mongolia, Montserrat, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Saint Lucia, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and The Grenadines, Suriname, Swaziland, SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Turks and Caicos, Ukraine, British Virgin Islands and Zimbabwe. Users in these countries can simply visit the App Store on their mobile device, search for ""google+"", and install the app. Google has originally launched the Google+ iOS app in July 2011; in 18 months of existence, it has reached version 4.2, adding support for iPad, iPhone 5 and iOS 6 along the way. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/google-plus-communities-beginners-guide/,Google+ Communities: A Beginner's Guide,"On Google+, users have the ability to manipulate their circles to control the groups of people and brands they receive information and content from, but there's no guarantee those brands or users will circle you to receive your updates. This is where Google+ Communities come in, Google's version of a group or forum, built to bring people together around particular topics. Launched in December, the types of Communities available to the Google+ audience seem endless — ranging from science, animals, development and more.  Communities are places where users can share specific questions, comments or content relating to a particular topic with other users who are just as interested in the conversation. For example, if you're a member of a cooking community, it's likely each post will contain something related to food. And if there is a user who is posting content unrelated to the chosen topic, a moderator could step in and police that person. Many of the more than 135 million monthly active Google+ users may have already explored Communities. But for those of you getting your first peek, check out our overview below.  After logging into Google+, you'll see an icon on the left rail for ""Communities."" This will bring you to the Communities homepage, which will give you a sample of the types of public communities available to join. You can choose to enter a community from here or search for a topic that may not be represented on the main screen, using the search bar at the top-right of the page. Say you're interested in joining a community focusing solely on Grumpy Cat; you'd be ecstatic to discover there are already a number of communities devoted to our favorite dour feline. While public community pages allow you to access and explore the content, you must join the community before you can comment or post. Many public pages will allow you to join immediately, but some are dependent on moderation. Private communities work differently from public communities in that they are, ahem, private. When a user creates a private community, as we'll discuss below, he or she can decide whether a private group appears in Google+ search  results. If you're interested in joining a private community you found through search, you must ask the community's moderator to join before viewing or interacting with any of the content.   Sharing content to a community is much like sharing to one of your circles. While you can post to your respective community directly from the community's page, you can also post from basically anywhere on the platform. If you find a story you'd like to share with your community, but you're not on Google+ at that time, use the +1 button from the story's page and select your respective community. At this time, Google+ prohibits you from sharing to multiple communities. Also, when you do choose to post to a community, you will not be able to share that same post through the public feed  — meaning you'd have to post your content twice for it to show up in the community and in the public feed. If you do post your content to a public community, though, it will still be visible to users who navigate to your profile page. But if you share a post to a private community page, it cannot be publicly viewed anywhere except in that community. Many community pages have added categories in order to organize the discussion. You will be prompted to choose a category within the community when you share a post. In the Android community, for example, users can post to ""Fix my phone!!!,"" ""Hacking discussion,"" ""Development"" and, for new community members to introduce themselves, ""Hello, world."" You should determine which category is the best fit for your post. While discussing a particular topic may be your life's passion, you may not wish to be notified every time a new post has been shared in one of your communities. Or maybe you do. Either way, notifications can be toggled on or off by clicking on the bell icon on your community's page. If notifications are on, you will get a notification by email, on your mobile device and by the Google toolbar when someone posts something new in the community. For public communities, notifications are off by default. For private communities, public communities where membership is moderated and communities that you created, notifications are on by default. So you've browsed all the public communities and you didn't find that exact community you hoped to join. Or maybe you want to create a private group for your old high school friends, for example. Google+ gives you the option to create your own community, and it's a breeze to do. When you're on the main Communities page, you'll see a red button on the top-right that says ""CREATE A COMMUNITY.""  You can then choose to create either a public or private community. On its FAQ page, Google notes that users cannot change a community page from private to public, or vice versa, once it has been created, so choose accordingly. If setting up a public page, choose what you want to name the community — names do not have to be unique — and then decide if you will allow anyone to join, or if you'd like to moderate memberships. For a private page, you can decide whether you want to hide the community from search or allow people to find the page and ask to join. Once the page has been created, there are still a few things to complete: You should choose a tagline, pick an appealing photo that describes the community, complete your About section and then add a few discussion categories. Now that your community has been created and set up, all that is left to do is invite users to the page and start the conversation. Much like how Reddit has become a great resource for content discovery and conversation, Google+ Communities are for users who are more interested in vibrant conversations around topics than they are about self-promotion. Quality community members are those who share relevant content that sparks conversation or debate, and who participate in conversations by leaving comments and +1'ing posts. Users whose intentions are to promote themselves or spam the community will most likely be removed by a moderator, so be careful how you approach your communities. Hopefully you have enough information to effectively navigate your way through Google+ Communities, or even to create your own community.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/hearst-magazines-to-apple-newsstand-first/,iPad Readers Guaranteed First Access to Hearst Magazines,"iPad owners are now getting more than just bells and whistles tacked on to some of their favorite magazines — they're also getting issues of those magazines first. As first uncovered by The Loop, Apple has set up a new category in its Newsstand store featuring 20 titles — all owned by Hearst — which will be released before they appear in print ""or any other digital edition."" Subscribers and single-issue purchasers will be able to access new releases at the same time. Exactly how much of a lead iPad readers will have will vary by magazine, but most will be within ""a couple of days"" of the print release, a spokesperson for Hearst told Mashable. Apple's advantage here isn't so much over print as over other digital newsstands, like Amazon's, Google's and Zinio's. Many magazines owned by companies other than Hearst already push out their digital editions ahead of print: The tablet edition of Conde Nast-owned Golf Digest, for example, goes live one week before print issues hit newsstands, a spokesperson for the magazine told Mashable. (However others, like Runner's World, sometimes appear several weeks after, we've noticed.) Why is Apple getting special treatment? Apple suggested it, says Hearst. The advantage for Hearst, presumably, is exposure. At Mashable's Media Summit in November, Hearst President David Carey said the success of its tablet editions relied heavily on promotion from digital storefronts. ""If your magazines land in the upper carousel of [Apple's] Newsstand, you sell a lot of product. If you're nowhere on that page, you're not going to do as well,"" he observed. Hearst's digital circulation is still marginal. In a note to employees sent at the beginning of the year, Carey said the company had amassed nearly 800,000 paid digital subscribers in the U.S. across its titles. To put that in context, just one of its titles, Cosmopolitan, has a print circulation of more than 3 million, according to ABC. Photo via iStockphoto, hocus-focus "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/huygens-saturn-titan-landing/,New Video Recounts Historic Landing on Saturn's Moon Titan,"Eight years ago this week, a European mission went where no one, or probe, had gone before, Saturn's huge moon Titan, and a new video animation is recounting that historic landing by the Huygens spacecraft. The European Space Agency's unmanned Huygens probe dropped onto the surface of Titan on Jan. 14, 2005, three weeks after separating from its parent Cassini spacecraft. The new animation, which was created by ESA using real Huygens data, captures the last portion of the lander's two-and-a-half-hour descent through Titan's thick, nitrogen-based atmosphere. The new Huygens landing video, which runs for 1 minute and 40 seconds, shows the touchdown from a variety of angles and ends with a real photo Huygens took of Titan's surface. 







 Though Huygens stopped sending data home to Earth 90 minutes after touching down, the landing continues to teach researchers about Titan. An analysis of Huygens data published late last year, for example, determined that the 400-pound probe bounced, slid and wobbled to a stop 10 seconds after first contacting the moon. The study suggests that Titan's surface at the time had the consistency of soft, wet sand with a fragile crust on top, researchers said. Titan is the largest moon of Saturn, and the second-largest moon in the entire solar system (only the Jupiter satellite Ganymede is bigger). With a diameter of 3,200 miles, Titan is nearly 50% wider than Earth's moon. Titan is the only object in the solar system besides Earth known to host stable bodies of liquid on its surface. But Titan's lakes and seas contain methane and ethane rather than water, as the huge moon has a weather cycle based on hydrocarbons. Complex carbon-containing molecules are known to swirl about in Titan's atmosphere, further intriguing scientists who regard the moon as one of the best places in the solar system to look for alien life. The $3.2 billion Cassini-Huygens mission, a joint effort involving NASA, ESA and the Italian Space Agency, launched in 1997 and arrived at Saturn in 2004. While Huygens is now a feature of the Titan landscape, the Cassini spacecraft continues to study the ringed planet and its many moons. Its mission has been extended through at least 2017.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/i-have-a-dream-internet-freedom/,'I Have a Dream' Posted in Defiance of Copyright for Internet Freedom Day,"As Friday is one year since the Internet blackout against the Stop Online Piracy Act, some Internet activists are marking the date by declaring ""Internet Freedom Day.""  How does one celebrate Internet Freedom Day? Fight for the Future, an advocacy group that played a key role in SOPA's defeat, is commemorating the date by uploading and sharing footage of Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech. Why is that a radical move? Footage of the speech is copyrighted by EMI, which has issued takedown notices several times after the speech has been uploaded to services such as YouTube.  Update: The video has been taken down from Vimeo. Fight for the Future is trying to learn more and is working to upload it elsewhere. Update II: The video is back, now on YouTube. Uploading the speech in acknowledged defiance of the copyright simultaneously celebrates Internet freedom and the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr., who advocated for civil disobedience as a means to effect change. Martin Luther King, Jr. day is Monday, Jan. 21.  ""It's untenable to have a world where young people can't easily hear and watch Dr. King's message of racial justice because it is censored by broken copyright laws,"" said Tiffiniy Cheng, one of Fight for the Future's co-directors, in a statement. ""We're asking everyone on the internet to honor Dr. King's legacy and take part in a small act of civil disobedience by sharing the full video of his speech today."" Fight for the Future's video argues that if SOPA passed, Internet users could have been penalized for uploading or sharing the speech and ""entire websites could have been shut down just for linking to it."" ""[The video is] copyrighted so what we are doing technically is illegal,"" said Evan Greer, campaign manager at Fight for the Future, in an e-mail to Mashable. We'd more likely get a takedown notice than a lawsuit. Other versions of it have been taken down from YouTube. We think we have an excellent argument for Fair Use since it is clearly part of political speech and we are not making any money off it."" Mashable reached out to Cheng via e-mail for more on why Fight for the Future picked the ""I Have a Dream"" speech:
 MLK Jr. fought for freedom for everyone — when I first heard his message, it changed me. Everyone should have the opportunity to see him speak. Hardly anyone wants to live in a world where something as inspirational and educational as Dr. King's speech can't be shared. And, Internet Freedom Day is about that. Learning and seeking knowledge is at the heart of what the internet is about it, and we're asking people to see and share the best of what has to be learned, albeit doing that it is illegal.
 Dr. King, perhaps, would have agreed with Fight for the Future's tactics.  ""One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws,"" he famously wrote in his Letter from Birmingham Jail. ""Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws."" Access the video here: ""MLK's 'I Have a Dream' speech is copyrighted. Share it anyway.""  Other activity being planned for Internet Freedom Day can be found at InternetFreedomDay.net.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/instagram-change-kicks-in/,Instagram Is About to Start Sharing Your Data With Facebook,"The revised Instagram Privacy Policy and Terms of Service finally kick in on Saturday — and in case you missed it, the part where the service said it might sell your photos to advertisers has been redacted. You can relax on that front. The only major change for users? Instagram is now allowed to start sharing their data with its parent company, Facebook.  ""Our updated privacy policy helps Instagram function more easily as part of Facebook by being able to share info between the two groups,"" the company wrote on an unsigned blog post. ""This means we can do things like fight spam more effectively, detect system and reliability problems more quickly, and build better features for everyone by understanding how Instagram is used."" The changeover also means your Instagram pictures will be fully hosted on Facebook's servers for the first time. Previously, the pics were hosted on Amazon Web Services.  No doubt Instagram will lose a few users who aren't fans of Facebook. That may be offset by continuing growth, however.  The company also announced Thursday it has 90 million monthly active users as of January, which it said was a 10% increase over December.  Readers with sharp memories may recall Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg throwing out the figure of 100 million Instagram users back in September. However, that number referred to the service's registered users.  All Instagram user-figure announcements before that, such as the 80 million mentioned in July, also referred to registered users. Monthly active users is a more accurate reflection of the service's popularity. Instagram won't say how many registered users it currently has, so we can't do an apples-to-apples comparison. However, if it's anything like other social services such as Twitter, the total of accounts is likely to be roughly double the monthly active number. Will Instagram be hurt or helped by the fact that it is joining its data to Facebook's? Sound off in the comments. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/internet-freedom-day/,What Is Internet Freedom Day?,"Friday, Jan. 18 marks the one year anniversary of the technology community's Internet blackout over the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and its sister bill, the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA). SOPA was intended to curb online content piracy, but Internet advocates warned it would have disastrous consequences for online free speech and worked to fight the bill. SOPA was shelved by its author soon after the blackout.  The story of SOPA's demise has become such an integral part of the Internet advocacy canon that some opponents of the bill decided the date of the blackout deserves to be documented with a holiday: Internet Freedom Day.  Internet Freedom Day was first proposed by lawyer Marvin Ammori in an early January op-ed for Wired, in part as a celebration of Internet advocacy and the SOPA saga but also of the Internet itself. ""So it's shocking that we don't already have an unofficial Internet Freedom Day, or even an official holiday like we do for the Fourth of July, given that the internet is one of the most revolutionary technologies the world has ever known,"" wrote Ammori. The idea spread though technology advocacy circles, prompting many of the most well-known organizations in the field to participate. Fight for the Future is engaging in civil disobedience around digital copyright and organizing a Thunderclap around the Twitter hashtag #InternetFreedomDay. Ammori, author of the Wired op-ed, has released a free eBook entitled On Internet Freedom. The Electronic Frontier Foundation is holding an Ask Me Anything on Reddit, where much of the initial grassroots organizing against SOPA began. Real-world events are planned for San Francisco and Washington, D.C. SEE ALSO: 'I Have a Dream' Posted in Defiance of Copyright for Internet Freedom Day
 Internet Freedom Day has also taken on an unexpected meaning to the technology community: It's become, in part, a celebration of the life of Aaron Swartz, the 26-year-old programmer who took his own life before his trial over computer fraud allegations was set to begin.  Swartz believed wholeheartedly in the principles of an open Internet and public access to knowledge, ideals shared by many in the technology community. He also played a key role in the defeat of SOPA, founding advocacy organization Demand Progress to lobby against the bill. Accordingly, InternetFreedomDay.net, where Internet Freedom Day activities are being listed, is dedicated to Swartz's ""incredible contributions to freedom, justice, and transparency."" A memorial service for Swartz is being held Saturday in New York City. The anti-SOPA movement started as a grassroots movement among a small group of concerned Internet-savvy citizens. It quickly grew into a powerful movement with the support of such Internet titans as Google and Wikipedia, the former putting a link with details about the bill on its homepage and the latter having blacked out its English-language site on Jan. 18, 2012. All told, 7 million people signed various petitions against the bill and nearly 1 million people made phone calls to Congress about it. The movement has since been a case study in the political power of the Internet, allowing people with niche but similar interests to rally together in an organized and politically effective fashion. To some, it's an example of old-school political organizing's evolution in the digital era — though a few observers have questioned whether Google and Wikipedia's involvement in the movement disqualify it from ""grassroots"" status.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/ipad-mini-demand-production-slowdown/,"iPad Production Slows, Is iPad Mini to Blame?","Sharp has cut production of 9.7-inch iPads possibly to accommodate increasing demand for the iPad Mini, according to a report. Reuters reports that production at Sharp's Kameyama plant in Japan is now at the minimal level for the larger screens and the slowdown began in late 2012. However, it was unclear whether the shift in production was because of a lag in post-holiday-season seasonal demand or an expanding consumer preference for the iPad Mini.  While analysts estimate that Apple sold between 19 million and 30 million iPads in its fiscal first quarter (which coincides with the calendar Q4), analysts are predicting a drop-off in fiscal Q2 of as much as 40% for iPad unit sales.  Meanwhile, there may also be a fair amount of sales cannibalization as consumers opt for the cheaper iPad Mini. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Ku, for instance, predicts that 8.2 million of the 23 million iPads shipped in fiscal Q1 were iPad Minis.  The speculation — along with other reports of production slowdowns at Apple — are one potential factor bedeviling Apple's stock price, which has slid under $500 recently. Despite the somewhat gloomy outlook, though, analysts are expecting Apple's Q1 earnings to possibly be its best ever. The company is set to report earnings for that quarter on Jan. 23.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/john-isner/,How Tennis Star John Isner Aces Social Media,"John Isner is six-foot-nine, America's best tennis player and holds the world record for longest match ever played.  Other than that, he's not so different from the rest of us — especially in his enjoyment of social media. Whether chatting with fans or tweeting about college sports or World Wrestling Entertainment, Isner is among his sport's more personable athletes on Twitter.  Isner was forced to pull out of this week's Australian Open with a knee issue, but that gave him some extra time to trade emails with Mashable. Read on to see how he first got into Twitter, who he likes to follow and what have been his most memorable experiences with social media.  You're a pretty active tweeter. How'd you first get into Twitter and are there any other social media platforms you enjoy as well? I was first introduced to Twitter by my agent about two-and-a-half years ago. I wasn't that into in the beginning but it has definitely grown on me a lot. I never could have imagined that I would have over 120,000 followers like I do now. So it's all been a very cool experience for me. I am most active on Twitter and I also have a Facebook page that I update, just not as much. Instagram is an impossibility because I am one of the brave few who still use the BlackBerry. I actually prefer it over the iPhone, so I'll be sticking with my BlackBerry for a long time.  How do you see social media being most useful? I use Twitter mostly to just interact with fans. One of the things I tweet the least about is tennis. I always find myself tweeting about everything but tennis. My Facebook page is the place to go to get more regular updates on my tennis. Some of my followers would probably prefer that I tweet more about tennis but I don't see that happening in the future.Â  I know you're a big fan of WWE, which is one of the more engaging social media sports brands. Are there any other teams and leagues your particularly enjoy following or keeping up with? Yes, the WWE is something that I actively follow on TV and on Twitter. I was just never was able to grow out of that stage in my life and I still thoroughly enjoy it. As you mentioned, they're more active on Twitter than probably any company I've ever seen before. And it seems as though their superstars are also very active. They get through to their fan base extremely well and Twitter is a huge catalyst for that. I follow the Carolina Panthers, Carolina Hurricanes, Charlotte Bobcats. I'm extremely passionate when it comes to the Panthers and my Georgia Bulldogs, so I definitely keep a close eye on them through Twitter. What's have been the most memorable things to come out of social media for you — either specific moments, or just in general? I would say what's been most memorable for me on Twitter has been the opportunity for me to interact other athletes that I admire. I have 'met' athletes from all different sports and have sort of developed a relationship with them all through Twitter. So, for me, that has been very neat. Do you have any rules about when you do and don't spend time on Twitter with regard to tournaments and competitions, or is pretty much always a part of your routine? When I am at an event I don't have any rules when it comes to tweeting. Whether I'm at a small event or Wimbledon, I treat it all the same. I'll tweet just as I normally do. My followers would probably prefer I tweeted more about tennis, especially when I'm competing, but I don't see that happening anytime soon.  Â  Photo courtesy Flickr, Kyle Tsui "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/kim-dotcoms-mega-rolls-out-for-early-access-users/,Kim Dotcom's Mega Begins Early Rollout,"Kim Dotcom's new service Mega has started to roll out for early-access users, revealing a wide-array of ambitious features and the service's premium prices, as reported by TechCrunch. Mega is the new venture of the founder of the now defunct Megaupload, which was seized by the U.S. government almost a year ago. The service will launch to the general public over the weekend, but it's already available to some beta users. The features already available, among others, are mobile access, instant messaging and word-processing. Ingrid Lunden of TechCrunch explains that the site basically looks like a ""simplified version of Dropbox.""  SEE ALSO: Kim Dotcom Chooses New Zealand as Home for His 'Mega' Project
 For basic, non-paying users, Mega will provide 50GB of space. For premium users, there will be three tiers of additional storage: 500GB, 2TB and 4TB for $13.29, $26.59 and $39.90 USD per month, respectively. Many features are still unavailable and will probably be rolled out after the official launch. Mega will supposedly offer domain, hosting, and email services, instant messaging, a cloud-based Office-like suite and desktop and mobile clients. In other words, Dotcom wants Mega to be much more than an encrypted version of Dropbox. We'll probably find out more details over the weekend, when Mega goes live for all users.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/lessig-responds-to-aaron-swartz-prosecutor/,Lawrence Lessig Responds to Aaron Swartz's Prosecutor,"Internet guru and academic Lawrence Lessig wrote a new blog post, sharing his feelings a week after Aaron Swartz's death and addressing Swartz's prosecutor's statement. ""Why was he being charged with 13 felonies?"" Lessig asked.  In an emotional post, Lessig confesses that he hasn't slept since finding out about his friend's death. ""I have been frantically trying to explain, to connect, and to make sense of all of this,"" he wrote. And even though there have been smiles in the midst of these sad times, that hasn't been enough. ""But these smiles have been drowned by endless sadness, and even greater disappointment — and none more pronounced than the utterly profound disappointment in our government, Carmen Ortiz in particular,"" he wrote. Comparing Ortiz's response to that of Massachussets Institute of Technology's president Leo Rafael Reif, who announced he would open an investigation into the school's role in Swartz's prosecution, Lessig wrote: I hate my perpetual optimism about our government. Aaron was buried on the tenth anniversary of the time that optimism bit me hardest — Eldred v. Ashcroft. But how many other examples are there, and why don't I ever learn? The dumbest-fucking-naive-allegedly-smart person you will ever know: that guy thought this tragedy would at least shake for one second the facade of certainty that is our government, and allow at least a tiny light of recognition to shine through, and in that tiny ray, maybe a question, a pause, a moment of ""OK, we need to look at this carefully."" I wasn't dumb enough to believe that Ortiz could achieve the grace of Reif. But the single gift I wanted was at least a clumsy, hesitating, ""we're going to look at this carefully, and think about whether mistakes might have been made."" [...] Ortiz's statement is a template for all that is awful in what we as a political culture have become. Lessig then goes on to argue that Swartz's crime was political and ""his harm was exactly none."" For that reason, he compares the treatment Swartz received to that of Martin Luther King Jr. Lessig notes that King was never convicted of any felony, and he was only charged with two ""bogus"" charges, of which he was acquitted. In Lessig's eyes, Swartz received a far worse treatment. SEE ALSO:  Congresswoman: 'Aaron's Law' to Honor Aaron Swartz Is Only the Beginning
 ""This is a measure of who we have become. And we don't even notice it. We can't even see the extremism that we have allowed to creep into our law,"" Lessig writes, before dealing a tough blow to Ortiz. ""And we treat as decent a government official who invokes her family while defending behavior which in part at least drove this boy to his death."" Lessig also had a final message for Swartz. ""I will always love you, sweet boy. Please find the peace you were seeking. And if you do, please find a way to share that too."" Photo courtesy of Flickr, Joi. "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/nasa-beams-mona-lisa-to-moon/,NASA Beams Mona Lisa to the Moon,"Call it the ultimate in high art: Using a well-timed laser, NASA scientists have beamed a picture of Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece, the Mona Lisa, to a powerful spacecraft orbiting the moon, marking a first in laser communication. The laser signal, fired from an installation in Maryland, beamed the Mona Lisa to the moon to be received 240,000 miles (384,400 km) away by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been orbiting the moon since 2009. The Mona Lisa transmission, NASA scientists said, is a major advance in laser communication for interplanetary spacecraft. ""This is the first time anyone has achieved one-way laser communication at planetary distances,"" David Smith, a researcher working with the LRO's Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter — which received the Mona Lisa message — said in a statement. ""In the near future, this type of simple laser communication might serve as a backup for the radio communication that satellites use. In the more distance future, it may allow communication at higher data rates than present radio links can provide."" 







 The LRO spacecraft was the prime choice to test out the novel communication method because the spacecraft was already equipped with a laser receiver. While most spacecraft exploring the solar system today are tracked using radio signals, NASA is tracking LRO via lasers as well. But the timing had to be just right. NASA used its Next Generation Satellite Laser Ranging station at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., to send the Mona Lisa signal to LRO. The team divided the famous da Vinci painting into sections measuring 150 by 200 pixels and then transmitted them via the pulsing of the laser to the orbiter at a data rate of about 300 bits per second. Once the lunar orbiter received the image, it reconstructed the photo, corrected for distortions created as the laser signal zipped through Earth's atmosphere, and then sent the image back to Earth using its normal form of communication: radio waves. ""This pathfinding achievement sets the stage for the Lunar Laser Communications Demonstration,"" Richard Vondrak, another researcher with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter said, ""a high data rate laser-communication-demonstrations that will be a central feature of NASA's next moon mission, the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust environment Explorer."" The Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer is slated to launch toward the moon later this year and will focus on mapping the lunar atmosphere and environment. Photo courtesy NASA

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/never-forget-this-high-tech-naked-privacy-violation/,Never Forget This Naked Privacy Violation,"Farewell, then, Rapiscan machines at airports. It's been genuinely horrible to know you (or rather to not know you, hidden TSA agents in back rooms). If we see invasive public technology of your kind in a hundred years, it'll be too soon.  After quietly removing many Rapiscans late last year, the TSA admitted Friday it was junking all 174 of them, $40 million worth of machinery, from airports around the U.S.  The agency made it clear it wasn't doing so voluntarily. Rapiscan was set to miss a deadline to turn all its scanners into ones that use generic cartoon images of bodies, a deadline mandated by Congress. (No, that isn't a typo: Congress did something right.) The agency is keeping its L-3 Communications machines, the ones that use radio waves instead of X-rays. These scanners don't show you; they show a stick figure. Areas of the figure's body light up if the radio waves detect a suspicious object in any area.  No, they may not be the best solution, and they warrant further investigation, but at least everything's above board with the L-3s. You can see the stick figure for yourself when you leave the machine. Functionally, it's the same as using a ""point to where the problem is"" doll.  Rapiscans (was there ever a more darkly appropriate name?) were the machines that transmitted a naked image — a far from generic one of you, with your true outline and skin folds — to a back room. There, low-paid agents probed the fleshy X-rays for anything that looked like suspicious equipment. Personnel were supposed to give warning before leaving or entering the room, thus no supervisor was allowed to barge in on them. What could possibly go wrong?  Anything and everything, as it turned out. Despite the TSA's best efforts to soothe us (see the head of the agency's labs who volunteered for one of the early press images, above) it was the TSA itself that was at the forefront of letting us know what was going wrong.  An anonymous ex-TSA agent reportedly wrote this blog post detailing what went on behind the scenes — in clouds of vapor smoke from e-cigarettes agents made crude remarks about the bodies they were seeing. And yes, occasionally they would step outside where they could see passengers who'd just walked through the Rapiscans. No wonder legal experts doubted the scanners were constitutional under the Fourth Amendment — especially given possible adverse health effects from the X-Rays.  It got worse. In 2011, a Dallas-Fort Worth TSA agent was able to carry a handgun through Rapiscan scanners multiple times without the weapon being detected. In that case, the screening agent wasn't paying attention. But it didn't seem to matter if they were. Look no further than the videos of blogger Jonathan Corbett, who detailed how he'd been able to strap sidearm-like metal objects to the side of his body that weren't detected because of the white-on-black nature of the image:  So the scanners were creepy, privacy violating, possibly unconstitutional and useless. How did they make their way into our airports in the first place? Because of powerful lobbyists — most notably former Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff, whose Chertoff Group represented Rapiscan Systems. You don't really need to connect too many dots here. Let the Rapiscans, then, be the high water mark. Let this stand as a warning for generations. The TSA shouldn't send the old machines back; they should be placed in museums so we never forget this disreputable chunk of our history. Let children be told: This was how bad things got for a few years in the 2000s, when we were so afraid we forgot about fearing fear itself. But we decided en masse that it was unacceptable, dehumanizing, and we never did it again.  Photo via Scott Olson/Getty Images "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/nhl-gamecenter/,NHL GameCenter App Is a Hockey Fan's Best Friend,"NHL hockey finally returns on Saturday after a drawn-out lockout that had many fans hurting almost as bad as a puck to the face.  So if you're a fan who wants to make up for months of lost hockey by compensating with that much more NHL action, the digital subscription service NHL GameCenter may be for you. It's not exactly cheap at $49.99 for the shortened 48-game season, but that money does get you pretty much everything NHL-related.  You'll be able to watch live streams of not just your favorite local team, but out-of-market games as well. You can also replay games you wanted to catch but weren't able to, saving space on the DVR for other important programming like Workaholics. Both home and away audio feeds are available, so you can decide whose slant you want on the action. Personalization features, meanwhile, allow for customizable news delivery about specific teams and players. Split-screen capability lets you double-dose on the hockey, while more than 800 classic games let you relive some of the best face-offs in NHL history.  There's not shortage of ways to access all that content either. GameCenter is available as an app for both iOS and Android devices, as well as XBox 360, Apple TV, PlayStation and more. For the full list, click here.   While the NHL season was finally saved, the lockout did provide a number of social media moments that reflected fans' dissatisfaction with the ordeal. In October, a meme fail by the NHL's Instagram account drew some angry backlash. In early December, when an agreement seemed reachable, a parody lectern Twitter account reflected many fans' angst. And a viral Nike ad a few weeks later struck a defiant tone.  Would you consider buying NHL GameCenter? Let us know why or why not in the comments.  Image courtesy Flickr, C.P. Storm "

MyFitnessPal, Fitbit, other fitness app and gadget makers have partnered to let people sync information across apps.  Lose It! is a tracker to record your calories in (meals) and calories out (exercise). It has a number of features that make entering this data less time consuming, such as remembering which foods and meals you enter often. You can also use the barcode scanner to quickly enter nutritional information from a box or carton of food. The app will remind you when you forget to log a meal, which might explain the app's success rate for helping people lose weight: 15 million pounds lost and counting, according to its website. The app is free and available on iOS and Android devices.  Good news for Mashable commenters who said they'd like to see Nike make an Android app to pair with the FuelBand — the Lose It! app is available for both Android and iOS.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/pandora-2012/,Pandora Listeners Created 1.6 Billion Stations in 2012,"2012 was a busy year for Pandora. Pandora users created over 1.6 billion stations over the course of 2012, and listened to over 1 million different songs by over 100,000 different artists.  All that added up to an astounding 13 billion hours of songs listened to throughout the year by a pretty amazing amount of people — 10,000 of the artists who have songs on Pandora had more than 250,000 unique listeners. ""When we created the Music Genome Project thirteen years ago, we had a dual purpose: connect people with music they love and help talented artists find their audiences,"" Pandora Founder and Chief Strategy Officer Tim Westergren said in a blog post announcing the numbers. ""We knew if we could get the first part right, the second would naturally follow."" This year Pandora faced scrutiny from those artists, who claimed the company wasn't appropriately compensating them for their work. In response Pandora detailed the compensation for several artists who are highly compensated on the service. For instance, Pandora claims that Lil' Wayne has made almost $3 million. A big part of Pandora's growth is the service's integration into other devices and services, allowing people to connect with their favorite music almost anywhere. Pandora was available in more than 1,000 different devices — at this year's CES, the most common of those devices being mobile gadgets. 125 million of Pandora's users have listened to tunes on the service using a smartphone or tablet. Pandora is available for the iPhone, Android devices, and things like the Barnes & Noble's Nook and the Amazon Kindle. Not just for phones and tablets, Pandora also comes standard in a number of major automobiles, and is available in more than 760 consumer electronics devices ranging from Blu-ray players to a refrigerator made by Samsung.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/power-hour-fight/,Musician Literally Wins Fight for Your Right to Party," Did you know that someone has literally been fighting for your right to party?  Or for legal use of the term ""power hour,"" anyway. It's commonly known as a drinking game, during which players take one shot of beer every minute for an hour. The term was actually trademarked in 2010 by realtor Steve Roose, who markets a DVD game named ""Power Hour."" Musician and party enthusiast Ali Spagnola has spent the past three years battling Roose over use of the term. Spagnola has an album titled Power Hour, that doubles as a drinking game. She developed and manufactured a shot glass USB as a way to distribute it. SEE ALSO: Check Out This Keyboard Made of Beer Cans In a very lengthy blog post about the entire process, Spagnola writes that she initially signed a contract allowing Roose to manufacture and sell her DVDs on his website and in stores. According to the post, Roose soon after dropped her product to focus on his own and then sent the ""first of many"" cease and desist letters. Others using the term for business, such as the website Power Hour HQ and iPowerHour, also received cease and desist letters. Roose successfully had Power Hours taken down from YouTube, websites and software. Spagnola's album was removed from Amazon. With help from Power Hour HQ founder Pete Berg, the Reddit community responded quickly to support the case. Roose backed down in 2010, but the court did not officially release the trademark until Dec. 31, 2012. Spagnola raised $5,700, but spent more than $30,000 throughout the long process. To celebrate, Spagnola is planning the Power Hour Freedom Victory Tour. The campaign, launched on Indiegogo, lets donators decide what cities she will tour. The goal is to visit 20 cities, but Spagnola says that it depends on the amount raised.  ""If I'm fortunate enough to raise a ridiculous amount over my goal, I have plans to bring a full band with me, go to cities outside the U.S., get a tour bus, lighting, maybe some pyrotechnics and turn the show into an even bigger extravaganza,"" says Spagnola.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/proposal-northern-lights-time-lapse/,Scientist Proposes to Girlfriend in Amazing Northern Lights Time-Lapse Video,"Dazzling green, purple and turquoise auroras glimmer in the sky over Iceland while a man proposes to his girlfriend in a new time-lapse video. Neuroscientist Alex Rivest shot the amazing aurora time-lapse video, which featured his own proposal, over several days and nights in September 2012. ""On a trip to Iceland I asked my girlfriend to marry me under the aurora borealis,"" Rivest wrote in a video caption. ""She said yes."" 







 The couple is seen hugging after Rivest bows down on one knee toward the end of the footage, all while gorgeous displays of the Northern Lights dance in the night sky. ""Iceland is a pretty amazing place to watch the stars and the aurora,"" Rivest told SPACE.com. The aurora borealis, as well as its Southern Hemisphere counterpart, the aurora australis, is created when charged particles from the sun hit atoms in Earth's high-altitude atmosphere, which are directed by the planet's magnetic field. The resulting light show has been dubbed the northern lights in the north, and the southern lights in the south. Rivest has a Ph.D. from MIT and studies how brains form episodic memories. Rivest is also the founder of a non-profit called Blue Kitabu, which works to build sustainable schools in Ghana and Kenya. And of course, he's also an avid photographer and videographer. The aurora time-lapse was shot with a Canon 5D Mark II and a Canon 40D, using a triggering device from pclix.com. This isn't the first time an astronomical event has served as a backdrop for a marriage proposal caught on video. Last year, stargazer Shookie Basuroy proposed to girlfriend Rajeep while watching a total solar eclipse from a hot air balloon above Cairns, Australia, on Nov. 14. Rajeep, like Rivest's girlfriend, said ""yes."" Photo courtesy of Alex Rivest

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/r-l-stine-ermahgerd/,Ermahgerd! R. L. Stine Talks Gersberms," Please don't tweet Goosebumps author R. L. Stine about the Ermahgerd meme. We know you want to share your knowledge of web culture with the master of children's horror fiction, but R. L. is hip to your silly memes and he doesn't get it. SEE ALSO: Viral Video Recap: Funniest Memes of the Week
 Mediabistro asked Stine about the web phenomenon that has everyone talking like a dog with braces eating peanut butter. Stine didn't seem terribly amused by the brace-faced fangirl, but that doesn't mean he can't have a little fun with it. It's free publicity, after all — or, erfer errll.  BONUS:  Top Memes of 2012  Five years ago, three college girls on a Caribbean vacation got a serious case of the heebeejeebies when a stingray photobombed their “say cheese” moment. The hilarious photograph could have ended up as just a fond vacay memory if it weren’t for a friend, who shared the image on Reddit in September of this year. Paul Ryan may have lost his bid for vice president, but the Wisconsin congressman achieved something far greater: Internet fame. The hot-bodied politician inspired not one, but two memes in 2012.  The first, Paul Ryan Gosling, took inspiration from the Ryan Gosling “Hey, Girl” meme that caught fire in 2008. The Hey Girl, It’s Paul Ryan Tumblr made Ryan something of a small government sex symbol, while @PaulRyanGosling offered 140-character sarcasm on things like Medicare. Paul Ryan’s other meme-able moment of 2012 happened when TIME released workout photos of Ryan in October. He may look like an extra on “Saved By the Bell,” but you can’t deny his impressive physique. Zeddie Little was happily jogging along in the 2012 Cooper River Bridge Run in South Carolina, when a photographer snapped a shot of Little and his perfectly pearly teeth.  The photo of the dashing runner was posted to Reddit in April under the title “My friend calls him ‘Mr Ridiculously Photogenic Guy.’”  Ridiculously Photogenic Guy ended up charming the Internet enough to earn a spot in meme history, even if he did lose the race. Octogenarian Cecilia Gimenez attempted to restore a 19th century church fresco, but instead, her amateur painting skills turned Jesus into a cartoon version of himself.  A BBC Europe reporter described the finished piece as “a crayon sketch of a very hairy monkey in an ill-fitting tunic.” The botched fresco also drew comparisons to Rowlf the Dog and Brutus Buckeye. The bad makeover dropped jaws across the web over the summer, especially after Gimenez demanded payment for her shoddy paint job. The Photoshopping wizards of the Internet put the Potato Jesus face on other famous works of art.  The sourpuss mug of a cat named Tardar Sauce scratched the Internet with delight in September. A Reddit user shared a photo of the grouchy-faced feline and the Grumpy Cat meme began spreading its crabbiness around the web. Grumpy Cat (and her brother, Pokey) now have their own website, which posts a “Daily Grump” and sells merchandise like t-shirts and Scrooge-like holiday cards.  Clint Eastwood’s somewhat surprise appearance at the GOP Convention had Republicans excited for Dirty Harry badassness. Instead, they got 10 minutes of the Hollywood legend talking to an empty chair.  The bizarre appearance spawned both the @InvisibleObama Twitter account and the Eastwooding photo fad, in which people shared images of empty chairs. Sorry, couches, but Eastwood crowned chairs the hottest furniture of 2012. An intense-eyed 20-something named Laina scared the crap out of men everywhere when her face first went viral as an advice animal macro this summer. The Overly Attached Girlfriend meme featured a screengrab from a parody Justin Bieber fan video created by Laina. The stalkerish lyrics and potent stare made Overly Attached Girlfriend the most loveable clingy lady friend in Internet history. In 2012, dog humiliation caught on like fleas at the dog park. Tumblr Dogshaming featured photos of pooches wearing signs that spelled out their transgressions — for the whole Internet to see. Dog owners with poop scoot marks on carpet or drawers filled with chewed up panties punish their furry friends with web-blasted embarrassment.   The 2012 presidential election was brought to you by the letter B. Mitt Romney’s debate meme-lights included references to Big Bird, Binders Full of Women, and Horses and Bayonets.  The Triple B threat ensured that election season had plenty of laughs to help distract from the real (and boring) issues.  Mitt Romney may not have scored the White House gig, but at least he’ll have something to laugh at. Or maybe not. A photograph of Hillary Clinton looking like a badass diplomat while donning sunglasses and checking her phone went seriously viral. And thus, Texts From Hillary was born. The Tumblr created multi-pane pics that feature Hillz’s faux reactions to texts from people like Sarah Palin and Barack Obama. The creators of the Tumblr made the decision to go out on top after meeting the secretary of state. The dignified goodbye earns extra kudos, especially when most of the Internet would be happy to stretch its fame.  The Swedish Chef may have coined Börk speak, but in 2012, the Internet couldn’t get enough of Berk speak. A photograph of a vest-sporting girl holding Goosebumps books debuted on Reddit in March and soon inspired a series of advice animal knockoffs. The widespread use of Ermahgerd talk (or Berks speak) even spawned web translators to help people perfect their lisped quips. U.S. Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney did not win the most medals amongst the Fab Five, but her ‘tude-filled face did help make her the most Internet famous.  After a tumble on her signature event, Maroney had to settle for a silver medal in the vault competition. During the medal ceremony, a photographer snapped a shot that seemed to sum up the gymnast’s feelings about her second place finish. The scowl flipped its way across the web and got ‘Shopped to gold medal glory on the Tumblr McKayla Is Not Impressed and elsewhere.  President Obama even got in on the unimpressed action recently, solidifying McKayla Is Not Impressed as the meme for 2012. Thumbnail: Mashable composite. Images courtesy of Larry D.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/seamless-flu-orders/,Seamless Shares Bizarre Special Requests From Flu Sufferers,"Living in a big city means germs bombard you in every subway car, taxi and cramped elevator. Seriously, urban air is like 7.6 percent phlegm — ask science. While calling a city home means more people are randomly sneezing on your face, it also gives you access to certain services, like food delivery at all hours of the day. This little perk comes in handy when you're stuck in a tiny apartment hacking up mysterious green substances and wiping boogers off your face.  Food delivery service Seamless knows about cold and flu season. Since 2013 began — and flu germs really started flying — Seamless has seen a 35 percent increase in chicken noodle soup orders compared to January 2012.

I have the flu so please tell your delivery person so they can be careful about not getting sick from me. I apologize for making you walk all the way to the 5th floor! Please knock on door and leave bag outside next to door - I'm sick and don't want to get delivery person sick. Please ring intercom and leave food on porch! We are sick and don't want to spread germs :-). Feeling sick! Leave it just inside the front door (perhaps on the dryer, which sits on the porch) if you'd like to avoid contact. Some sickies even have really nice friends that order food for them. Please give him a hug. He is sick. Can you write a card? Please say: Roses are red. Violets are blue. I love chili all over you.  My friend is sick and I am surprising her with this soup.  She is not expecting it.  Please tell her I love her. Please note that this is a get well present for a sick friend.  Please assure him that the payment has already been made and tell him:  ""Your friends and colleagues wish you a speedy recovery'' And then there's the people who just want the delivery person to hurry up, bring some napkins and pack an extra side of love. seamless wait time estimates 20 minutes, if you can send any sooner it would be greatly appreciated....  I'm sick and in desperate need of sarges soup!!! Hey guys—-I have a bad cold and I'm too sick to leave the house to get food. Just need a bite to eat, so the sooner this can get here, the better.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/sony-sell-new-york-headquarters/,Sony to Sell Its New York Headquarters for $1.1 Billion,"Sony Corporation of America (a subsidiary of Sony Corporation) is selling its U.S. headquarters building in New York City to a consortium led by The Chetrit Group, the company has announced.  The price for the building, located at 550 Madison Avenue, is $1.1 billion. Sony will remain in the building for up to three years under a leaseback arrangement with the purchaser. The transaction is expected to close in March 2013.  Sony doesn't hide the reasons for the sale: it wants to ""strengthen its financial foundation"" and ""improve its cash flow by carefully selecting investments, selling assets and strengthening control of working capital such as inventory.""  The company has been piling up losses quarter after quarter in recent years. After paying off debt related to the building and other transaction costs, Sony expects to gain approximately $685 million, which will pump some blood into its balance sheet. Sony doesn't plan to stop at this sale, though. Reuters reports the company is looking to sell its headquarters in Tokyo as well, for a similar price - $1.14 billion.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/venture-capital-2012/,VC Funding Declined For First Time in 3 Years,"Startups in the U.S. had a tougher time getting funding in 2012 than the year before, a new report suggests. VCs invested $26.5 billion in just under 3,700 deals last year, a 10% decline in funding dollars and a 6% decline in the number of deals, according to a MoneyTree report by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Association, using data from Thomson Reuters. This the first time annual VC investments have declined in three years.  Cleantech and life sciences companies experienced the biggest dip in funding year-over-year — a decline of 28% and 15%, respectively. Meanwhile, Internet-specific companies — which accounted for 25% of all VC dollars for the year — received $6.7 billion in investments, down 5% from 2011. The number of funding deals for these companies also declined by 5% to 976. Just as importantly, the number of young companies who received venture capital for the first time declined by 11% to 1,163 and the total amount of first-time financing given to these companies was down 24% year-over-year to $4.1 billion. Tracy Lefteroff, the global managing partner for VC practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers, pinned the drop in funding to ""general economic uncertainty"" from the fiscal cliff and elections as well as investors ""being more discriminating"" with their funds, particularly when it comes to newer startups. ""They're holding on to reserves to continue to support the companies already on their portfolio,"" Lefteroff said in a statement. That doesn't necessarily mean the boom times are over for startups just yet. Software companies experienced a 10% increase in VC investments and an 8% rise in the total number of deals. Likewise, Internet companies still fared well overall. As the report points out, 2011 was a record year for investments in this category and even with the decline, 2012 still had the second highest annual investment in Internet companies since 2001.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/18/windows-8-price-hike/,Windows 8 Will Cost You $120 After Jan. 31,"Microsoft launched Windows 8 in the fall with attractive pricing — just $39.99 for Windows 7, Vista or XP users — but come February the price goes up. Way up. After the promotional upgrade offer ends on Jan. 31, anyone running an older version of Windows will have to pay $119.99 for the privilege of running Windows 8, a Microsoft blog post reveals. And that's just the basic edition; if you want Windows 8 Pro, it'll cost you $199.99. While it's a steep increase, jacking the price up on Windows 8 upgrades makes some sense. Although Microsoft has provided few details about how many machines are actually now running Windows 8, reports suggest the platform isn't performing as well as expected. By giving users a deadline, it encourages anyone on the fence to buy now, potentially giving adoption of the new OS a final big push. SEE ALSO: The Problem With Windows 8
 The new pricing plan has options than just the basic and Pro upgrade products. If you buy a PC with basic Windows 8 and decide to upgrade after the deadline, that'll cost you $99.99. And Windows 8 Pro users can add Windows Media Center and DVD playback via the Media Center Pack for $9.99. If you're building a PC from scratch, none of these options are what you're looking for. Microsoft says you'll want the Windows 8 System Builder — a product usually reserved for OEMs — which typically runs around $100-$165. If you're interested in upgrading to Windows 8 for cheap, there's still time. Windows 8 Pro costs just $40 for the next 13 days, or if you really want the DVD copy, you can buy one at retail for $69.99. The full breakdown on the new pricing is below. Tell us what you think of Microsoft jacking up the price in the comments. Windows 8 Pricing After Jan. 31: Windows 8 Pro upgrade edition (for Windows 7, Vista and XP users): $199.99 Windows 8 upgrade edition (for Windows 7, Vista and XP users): $119.99 Windows 8 Pro Pack (for Windows 8 users): $99.99 Windows 8 Media Center Pack (for Windows 8 Pro users): $9.99 Windows 8 System Builder (for DIY PC builders): $100-$165 The new Windows is here. Windows 8 is a dramatic departure from Windows 7, blowing up the Start menu into a vibrant Start Screen that's electric with activity and well suited for touch devices like tablets. Despite some inconsistencies (particularly with the traditional desktop, which still exists), the new interface is powerful, fast and convenient. Wherever you are in the system, you can always call up the ""Charms"" from the right side -- a set of top-level commands that include Start, Search, Share, Devices and Settings. Microsoft re-defined how apps communicate with each other, letting you share from any app that enables it. This is how sharing from the Netflix app looks, but the same functionality exists in most other apps with shareable content, calling up a similar list of sharing services. Snap is kind of the new minimize, letting you put two apps side by side with one of them shrunk to a vertical column. It's useful when the app is well suited to a scrolling list, like Bing. Although the desktop still exists in Windows 8, the new UI is ever-present. It makes for some odd mash-ups, like this modern-looking Wi-Fi settings menu. Other functions call up traditional dialogs. The Windows Store has the same clean look and feel as other modern-UI apps, although it could use more big-name apps. The New York Times app mirrors the look of Microsoft's news apps, with a horizontal scroll of stories you can naturally swipe through. The swiping works much better with a touchscreen, since on a touchpad swipe tends to take you too far ahead or back. Here's how a Twitter client looks in Windows 8. Twitter has said it's working on its own Windows 8 app. One powerful feature of Windows 8 is your identity is portable -- if you have a Microsoft ID, you can log in to another Windows 8 PC, and it'll import your settings via the cloud, effectively becoming your PC. You can even download your own apps to the new machine once you authorize it. Photo courtesy of Microsoft "

But Bulgarian politician Ahmed Dogan was unhurt after an as-yet-unnamed assailant rushed the stage and attempted to shoot him with a small handgun. Dogan is the leader of Bulgaria's opposition movement for Rights and Freedoms. As he addressed that group's congress on Saturday, an attacker attempted to shoot him but the gun reportedly ""misfired,"" according to the Sofia, Bulgaria news agency. The agency said Bulgaria's Socialist party (one of several parties in opposition to the Movement for Rights and Freedoms in Bulgaria) issued a statement condemning the assassination attempt.

The advanced aircraft is grounded around the world after a battery burst into flames. The suspension of all 50 working Dreamliners follows a Jan. 16 emergency landing by an All Nippon Airways pilot after he smelled something burning, and saw a cockpit warning light up indicating a battery problem. It turned out that one of the plane's batteries had caught fire. Investigators are working to determine why — faulty wiring, design, system assembly, or the battery itself. In the photo above, a leaking battery is carried out of an All Nippon Airways (ANA) Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane at Takamatsu airport on Janaury 17, 2013 after the plane made an emergency landing at the airport the day before. Boeing, for whom the Dreamliner is key to the company's growth plans, has been the target of scrutiny because of a long series of failures in the aircraft. Now the glare is focused on its lithium-ion batteries. But blaming this type of battery for the fault would be like scorning all automobiles because of the Ford Pinto. In fact, lithium ion batteries are not all the same. Experts note that Boeing chose to rely on a lithium cobalt oxide battery configuration for the 787, a chemistry that, while delivering powerful performance, has in the past been responsible for fires in laptop computers and cellphones. The 787 battery is manufactured by Japan's GS Yuasa, one of the most respected lithium ion battery makers in the world. In its hybrid-electric Volt car, for example, GM chose to use a battery combining lithium with two ion chemistries — nickel manganese cobalt, and manganese spinel. China's BYD uses yet a third chemistry: lithium iron phosphate. What all three have in common, experts say, is that they are far less flammable than lithium cobalt oxide. ""It's essentially due to the crystalline structure,"" Shu Sun, an analyst with Bloomberg New Energy Finance, told me in an email exchange. ""The olivine and spinal structure of [lithium iron phosphate and manganese spinel] make them safer."" All five experts interviewed for this post also emphasized that, while the chemistry is important, safety comes as well in the design of the battery system and the electronics installed to govern its use. ""I suspect the real problem lies in the cell assembly by [GS Yuasa] and, perhaps more important, the control circuitry design,"" said Ralph Brodd, one of the world's most respected battery experts. Brodd said that Tesla, for example, uses a nickel cobalt aluminum chemistry. ""Tesla developed a sophisticated algorithm to measure voltage, current and temperature for each cell in their pack,"" Brodd told me. ""If one fails or acts up, it can disconnect that individual cell without interrupting the operation of the battery. That is what Boeing needs to do."" A Boeing spokeswoman, asked to respond to this, said, ""Lithium ion batteries were selected after a careful review of available alternatives because they best met the performance and design objectives of the 787. There are multiple backups to ensure the system is safe. These include protections against over-charging and over-discharging."" The makers of vehicles and electronic devices make a choice in their battery selection, depending on their requirements: What chemistry will deliver electricity the fastest, with the most punch, and the longest period of time? Electronics can help correct for error if you get greedy and demand too much. But the chemistry does in fact matter. As one battery expert told me, ""Batteries are inherently unstable devices (we call them 'charged' for a reason!)."" Photo via AFP/Getty Images, JIJI PRESS

http://mashable.com/2013/01/19/guide-to-job-interview/,The Ultimate Guide to Crushing Your Job Interview,"Josh Tolan is the CEO of Spark Hire, a video powered hiring network that connects job seekers and employers through video resumes and online interviews. Connect with him and Spark Hire on Facebook and Twitter. All your hard work and perseverance has finally paid off. The hours spent scrolling through job boards, the numerous takes on your video resume and the nights you stayed home to take part in an industry Twitter chat have all been leading up to this moment: You have a job interview with your dream company. Congratulations!  Take a moment to savor in your victory, but make sure it's just a moment. After all, there are still plenty of ways you can screw up this huge opportunity and lose out on the job of your dreams. Now is not the time for complacency. With an average of 118 applications for every open position being posted, it's a good bet you're not the only superstar candidate who made it to the next level.  Your resume, credentials, and networking powers have gotten you this far. But now it's time for the interview, which means a different sort of preparation. If you want to really kill it in the interview, whether that interview is in-person or through online video, here are some things you need to think about. This might seem like old news, but just because it's obvious doesn't mean it's not important. You need to dress to impress when it comes to your interview. If your interview is through online video, you might think you can dress down a bit and worry a little less, but this certainly isn't true! Dress just as nicely as you would for an in-person meeting.  You'll also want to pay attention to the colors you choose before heading out the door or turning on your webcam. This isn't a fashion show, and some colors won't be right for an important job interview. You'll want to stick to conservative and neutral colors like browns and blacks. If you want to throw a little color in there, think about green, which is the color of money and can send a subconscious message that you'll be able to bring real dollar value to the company. Stay away from bright primary colors like red and yellow because you want your interviewer focused on your words, not your outfit.  However, if everyone is running around the company in t-shirts and jeans, it might be tempting to wear your best sneakers to the interview. But, keep in mind that you want to make a professional first impression, and always dress for a position several notches above the one for which you're interviewing. If you're interviewing at a creative, casual agency, make sure the attire you settle on is professional and conservative (although perhaps don't show up looking like a Wall Street power broker). Wait until you're hired to show off your more fashionable and fun side.  Now that you've decided on your interview attire, it's time to dig deeper into the organization. Read the company's stated values and objectives on its website. Search on the web and in trade publications to see if the company has achieved anything noteworthy recently, whether an industry award or opening a new branch. Look at the larger issues in the overall industry and compare your company of choice to see how they stack up. All of this research can give you great ideas for tailored questions to ask about the organization when the interviewer turns the floor over to you at the end of the meeting. Perhaps another employee's experience can help you avoid a huge misstep or prepare you better for tricky questions. Ask questions on social sharing sites like Quora and LinkedIn Answers to see what experiences others have had at the company. You might also want to see what users have posted about the company on Glassdoor, where employees and candidates alike go to share information about companies from interview tips to salary ranges.  You can also use social media to connect with current and former employees to get the inside scoop. Send a polite message asking the contact if they have time to discuss the company and then pick their brains about the organization. This will help you get a better view of what the day-to-day life would be like at your dream job. Make sure you ask good questions, but always be tactful. You don't want to phrase your questions too negatively for fear you'll get evasive answers. You might also want to consider asking those current and former employees you connected with about their working relationship with the boss. The leadership style of the boss can really impact the company culture, whether negatively or positively, so this is important information to know before heading into your interview. You want to enjoy your job, after all, which might be hard if you're managed by The Office's Michael Scott.  Finally, it's also important to do some research into your interviewer. Look them up on the web, read their company bio and find them on social media. Their social media presence might even help you gain insight into their interview style. Will they be more conversational or stay by-the-book and stick to their questions? Looking at an interviewer's social media profile can help you gauge how to interact with them in the interview setting. Plus, social media can help you connect with your interviewer before ever stepping foot in the office. You can share an interesting article or even discuss a recent trend to make a connection before the job interview begins.  Companies from Google to Amazon like to use tough questions to get candidates turned around during the interview process. This is because companies want to see how well you think on your feet under pressure. If you get a question about filling a bus with golf balls or what kind of animal you would be, don't panic. Make sure your answer has some form of real-world value and show the employer how you think through a problem. For the animal example, you might say you'd love to be a cat because you like to work independently and set your own goals. You've now answered the question and brought it back to your own skills and qualifications, instead of just providing a wacky answer.  The most important thing to remember with tough questions is to always remain calm and collected. If you seem like you're going to pieces, the interviewer will think you can't handle the stresses of the office.  It's just as important for you to use the interview to find out about the company as it is for the employer to test you. Here are five questions you should make sure you ask to discover a little bit about the company culture before mentally decorating your office. What do you like best about working for the company? The answer to this question will tell you a lot about the company culture and the interviewer in general, which is important if your interviewer is also destined to become your boss. If the things they name off sound completely unappealing to you, this is probably not an organization you'll enjoy spending your 9-to-5.  How would you describe your company culture in five words? This question might seem a bit obvious, but it's also helpful in learning just what the company values. The five words your interviewer chooses will most likely be the most important and prevalent aspects of the company culture.  What is the growth opportunity like for this position? You want to have room to grow, learn and achieve in your new position. Asking about growth opportunity is both a good way to find out how much you can achieve and also brand yourself as a forward-thinking candidate. If the interviewer is a little light on details for how you can grow in the position or acquire additional education and training, perhaps career growth isn't in the cards at this company.  What are the qualities of your most successful employees? This question will tell you the most important qualities you should possess in order to succeed in the company environment. For instance, maybe the ability to multi-task and thrive in a chaotic environment is essential. Or perhaps the ability to work as a team and communicate clearly is key. Listen carefully to these ideal qualities and consider what they reveal about the overall organization to see if you'd fit in.  What's a common misconception about the company you would like to clear up? Almost every company is the victim of common misconceptions, whether it's about the company itself, the larger industry, or a specific department. For instance, a startup company might seem like all fun and games from the outside, but this just covers up the long hours and high stress levels of employees. Don't let perks like free lunch or an office gym stop you from finding out what life is really like at the organization. Your interviewer's answer will tell you both how the outside world views the organization and also how the company views itself.  There's plenty to remember before heading in for your important interview. If you follow this guide, you'll dramatically increase your chance of killing it in your interview and finally landing your dream job. What are some of your tips for crushing it in the interview?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/19/kim-dotcom-mega-open/,Kim Dotcom's 'Mega' Now Open to Public,"It's here: Entrepreneur Kim Dotcom's long-anticipated file-sharing site, Mega, is open to the public.  Dotcom broke the news this morning with this tweet: As of this minute one year ago #Megaupload was destroyed by the US Government. Welcome to Mega.co.nz — Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) January 19, 2013 Mega is a follow-up to the entrepreneur's last endeavor, MegaUpload, which was shut down by the U.S. government one year ago, today. The new service will include mobile access, instant messaging and word-processing — similar to Dropbox — as well as hosting, email and domain-name services.  Basic, non-paying users of the site will get 50GB of space to use. Premium users can choose between three tiers of storage: 500GB, 2TB and 4TB, which respectively cost $13.29, $26.59 and $39.90 per month.  SEE ALSO: Mega Begins Early Rollout

She has covered Armstrong for more than a decade, from his original battle with cancer to his seven Tour de France titles.  SEE ALSO: Lance Armstrong Interview Stirs Outrage on Social Media

Downloaded will have its world premiere on March 10 at the Texas festival, according to VH1, which financed the film. A panel including director Alex Winter (best known as Bill of Bill and Ted fame), as well as Napster co-founders Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker, will follow the screening on March 12.   The film focuses on the birth of digital-media sharing, and charts Napster's tumultuous journey from its founding in 1998 to its acquisition by online music store Rhapsody in 2011. It also looks at how the service paved the way for iTunes, Spotify and other online music services. ""After more than a decade of declining sales of recorded music and imperfect attempts to present a licensed alternative, the influence of Napster continues to be felt,"" according to a SXSW description of the service. SEE ALSO: The Social Music Network: Napster Documentary in the Works
 Fanning and Parker teamed up again in 2012 to launch Airtime, a social video network that's reportedly suffering from a stagnant user base.  Parker, a major investor in Spotify, recently shared the stage with Metallica's Lars Ulrich, who famously spoke out against Napster. The two parties have an acrimonious history, with Ulrich filing a copyright-infringement lawsuit against Napster in 2000. The drummer also testified in front of the U.S. Congress, condemning online file-sharing at large. (Interestingly, Metallica has now put its entire catalog on Spotify.)

http://mashable.com/2013/01/19/nasty-client/,Nasty Client Website Lets Businesses Review Customers,"Think twice before skipping out on tipping your contractor, or else small businesses may end up blacklisting you. A former landscape company owner created NastyClient.com, a rating and review website that lets businesses file reports against its customers. Turning the tables on consumers, creator Matt Stachel allows owners to tell their side of the story.  Sites such as Yelp or Angie's List give an open forum for consumers to rave or rant about their experiences, but platforms for business owners aren't as accessible.  After dealing with his fair share of nasty clients for more than 20 years, Stachel started the site two years ago.  ""It wasn't necessarily one person or one story, it was a culmination of years of frustration and not having a resource for me that could help,"" Stachel tells Mashable.  Users on Nasty Client can file a report detailing their unfavorable experience, as well as a customer's name and location. At least 80% of reports deal with unpaid bills, Stachel says.  A cheated worker can have some harsh words to share, so reviews are edited for profanity and slang to prevent slander. Businesses can mail reports to the rogue client to make them aware of their Internet shame, and to inform them that other companies may not be too keen on working with them in the future.  The site also serves as a pre-screener. Users can look into a database of clients before making any deals. Similar to the infamous wall of shoplifters at your local supermarket, Nasty Client features an ever-changing ""Top Offenders"" list that highlights every business owner's worst-case scenario.  Professionals can share their woes for $15.99, which grants a one-year membership.  ""Companies are so excited; they've had bad customers for years. It's painful to lose money, and you don't forget names,"" Stachel says.  He hopes to add an offline alert that informs users each time a new offender is added in their area. More than 3,000 businesses have signed up, with 6,000 reports submitted. Stachel says the site has garnered positive feedback from users through social media.  ""There's always people on Facebook or email saying how much they love it and how it really helps, or how they had the same idea two years ago. It just goes to show how much something like this is wanted and needed."" Image courtesy of Flickr, cavale "

Nearly 100 years later, Barack Obama will take that same oath.  The U.S. presidential inauguration looks a tad different than it did a century ago.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/19/robot-fish-underwater-research/,Robot Fish Swims Long Distances for Underwater Research," A group of Michigan State University researchers have developed a robotic fish that, according to them, can swim practically indefinitely, gathering data on lakes and riverbeds.  The robot is called Grace, an acronym for Gliding Robot ACE and it's equipped with sensors to gather data and measure water's temperature and quality. Grace is able to autonomously swim both by flapping its tail as well as gliding through the water. This combination lets it travel long distances. ""Swimming requires constant flapping of the tail, which means the battery is constantly being discharged and typically wouldn’t last more than a few hours,"" said Xiaobo Tan, the project's leading researcher. ""This is why we integrated both locomotion modes — gliding and swimming — in our robot,” Tan said. “Such integration also allows the robot to adapt to different environments, from shallow streams to deep lakes, from calm ponds to rivers, with rapid currents.""

 The researchers tested the robot fish last year in a Kalamazoo lake, where it swam and sent back its sensors' readings wirelessly.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/19/samsung-galaxy-tablets-upgrade/,Samsung Galaxy Tablets Get Android Jelly Bean Upgrade,"Two of Samsung's best-selling tablets, the Galaxy Note 10.1 and Galaxy Tab 2, are finally getting the latest version of Google's Android 4.1 operating system, the so-called Jelly Bean version.  But Samsung has made it worth waiting for with the addition of Premium Suite, which the company says includes ""dramatic improvements"" to the tablet's multitasking features, as well as improvement to the S Pen stylus included with each device. On the multitasking side, Samsung has now added several features that leverage the Galaxy Note 10.1's Multi Window view that lets you run two apps side-by-side. The new Cascade View feature lets users freely resize, move and pin selected applications in multiple views, running them simultaneously or while operating the home screen. Air View lets lets users easily preview content such as video, email attachments and photos without having to open the related apps. And a new Quick Command lets users create customized and use preset shortcuts for the S Pen, using designated S Pen strokes, to launch apps and services. Other new features include enhancements to the Galaxy's handwriting software that now lets you send handwritten notes via email as well as hand-write directly in the software's S Planner. So you could, for example, circle the date of an important upcoming appointment and write directly on the S Planner calendar (in monthly view only), just as you would on a paper version. Samsung has also added templates for S Note designed to let users add effects to their digital content with Idea Sketch and also insert video directly into not only Note templates but also other templates.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/19/storify-facebook-privacy/,Can Storify Publish Your Private Facebook Status Updates?,"Since its public launch in mid-2011, Storify has become a favorite tool for digital journalists to compile photos, videos and status updates from across the web into an easy-to-read format.  But what about the information that's meant to remain private? AGBeat reported that Julie Pippert, founder of Artful Media Group, discovered what she's calling a loophole in the process: private Facebook status updates that can still be collected and displayed on Storify.   Pippert came across the apparent glitch while using the Storify app. She said she was able to share a friend's private update, by clicking the ""Storify"" icon next to the ""Like"" and ""Comment"" links, and display it directly into her Storify feed — showcasing her friend's name and picture.   Pippert told AGBeat: ""I felt so terrible about what happened that I started digging and checking ... I figured out that although anything can be copied, screen captured or otherwise shared, anyone who installs the Storify app can do it with one click, even if it is marked or otherwise set to be private.""
 Storify users have always been able to pull information from people they're connected to on the web. The concern here, Pippert said, is that users of the app are able to bypass what's otherwise private on Facebook (say, a personal post in a private group.)  SEE ALSO: What Facebook's New Graph Search Means For Your Privacy
 A Facebook spokesperson told Mashable via email that it isn't a ""loophole,"" but instead a process similar to screen grabbing and reposting. Storify isn't getting any of the data through Facebook's APIs, the spokesperson said. ""The behavior appears to result from Storify users utilizing a browser extension that essentially cuts and pastes content available to that user to the Storify site ... This is not a result of the Storify application for Facebook."" Are you comfortable with your private Facebook posts being shareable through Storify? Tell us in the comments below.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/19/video-effects-tutorials/,5 YouTube Channels to Learn Amazing Video Effects,"In the opening scene of 1997's Wild America, a young Jonathan Taylor Thomas nervously wades into a pool while his older brothers throw firecrackers at him. The guys are shooting a film, under the strict motto ""Every Good Movie Needs an Explosion."" Thomas, being the youngest, becomes the automatic stuntman.  Thankfully, those kinds of stunts aren't necessary anymore for cool effects — we've got YouTube instead.    Here at the office, we underwent the oh-so-strenous task of surfing the Internet to track down the best channels for DIY video effects (VFX) tutorials. (You're welcome, younger siblings.)  Many use high-end programs, like Final Cut Pro and Adobe After Effects. But if you don't have either, don't sweat it — you can download a free 30-day trial of After Effects on Adobe's website. For basic editing, the standard programs that come with Macs and PCs — iMovie and Windows Movie Maker, respectively — do the trick just fine.  SEE ALSO: 8 Essential Photoshop Tutorials on YouTube
 Be warned: These guys make it look easy. If you're new to editing, it might take awhile to move as quickly as the videos. Regardless, the outcome will still be awesome — and you won't have to worry about losing a finger either.  


 The skinny: Freddie Wong, known best by the Internet as ""Freddie W,"" is a Los Angeles-based filmmaker and VFX artist. He hosts two YouTube channels: freddiew and freddiew2. The first is a collection of his personal videos, and the second hosts his behind-the-scenes shots and tutorials. His movies generally include high-energy action sequences with gunfire, explosions and plenty of gaming culture references.  Wong also helped produce the 2010 horror ""Z Movie"" Bear.   Programs covered: Adobe After Effects; Final Cut. Specialities: Action/Humor.    Recommended tutorials: 
 ""Realistic Muzzle Flare"" (above) ""Beach Justice"" ""Green Screen Match Lighting"" 


 The skinny: Zach King launched the ""Final Cut King"" channel during college at Biola University Film School after noticing a lack of easy, DIY tutorials for Final Cut and related programs. Currently, his channel — which features both original videos and tutorials — has more than 225,000 subscribers. He takes editing related questions from fans — sometimes, he told Mashable, he'll get as many as 100 emails a day.  ""I love doing these kinds of things because it's a really fast turn-around. You can be on to a next project in a couple of days,"" he said. ""I'm A.D.D. like that.""   Similar to Wong, King's videos include a handful of gaming and app references.  Programs covered: Final Cut (6,7 and X); Apple Motion; Soundtrack Pro; DVD Studio Pro; Apple Color 1.5. Specialities: Action/Humor.    Recommended tutorials: 
 ""Explosions and More"" (above) ""Final Cut X Overview"" ""Motion 5: Getting Started"" 


 The skinny: VFX BRO, also based in Los Angeles, has been posting special effects tutorials on his channel since 2010. The tutorials focus heavily on background effects — 3D, slow motion and object tracking — and give great introductions to a variety of editing software in addition to After Effects, such as Cinema 4d, Mocha Pro and Pixel Farm PFTrack.  Programs covered: Adobe After Effects; Cinema 4d; Mocha Pro; Pixel Farm PFTrack. Specialties: Special Effects.  Recommended tutorials: 
 ""After Effects - Cloning Effect"" (above) ""After Effects - Fruit Ninja"" ""After Effects - 'Slowmo' Bullet Shell"" 


 The skinny: Corridor Digital's website bio,""Crazy action and visual fx? Heck yeah,"" sums it up nicely. The hosts, Niko and Sam, cover a wide range of action special effects — like explosions, muzzle effects and bullet hits — with their appropriately titled tutorial series ""Shoot Your Friends.""  Programs covered: Adobe After Effects; Final Cut. Specialities: Action.  Recommended tutorials: 
 ""Filming Basics"" (above) ""Bullet Hit"" ""Color Grading Masterclass""  The skinny: Surfaced Studio, like the others mentioned above, specializes in tutorials for action effects. Points of interest include zombie-like running effects, ""blood hits"" and 3D integration.   A few videos highlight the program Autodesk 3ds Max — originally, the software runs for around $1,000, but you can download a free trial on the company's  website.  Programs covered: Adobe After Effects; Cubase 5; Autodesk 3ds Max. Specialities: Action/Zombie Effects. Recommended tutorials:
 ""Zombie Run"" (above) ""Realistic-Looking Blood Hit"" ""Dissolve Into Crows"" At Mashable, we're all about trying things out for ourselves.  We made our own short video, with Final Cut Pro and a free downloaded version of After Effects, using a few of the tips above. Again, if you don't have Final Cut, iMovie and Windows Movie Maker work just as well.   Using Freddie W.'s ""Realistic Muzzle Flare"" tutorial, we added a muzzle flare effect to the end of a Nerf gun. For extra fun, we even gave our adorable office dog, Holly, a fire-breathing makeover:   The sound effects and inserted images were all free from the Internet. Sweet Sound Effects, which is actually operated by Zach King, was where we found the audio clips, and we took the explosions from Detonation Films. We surfaced the muzzle image from a quick Google search.  Are there any good channels we forgot to include? Or, do you have any cool VFX videos you've shot yourself? Share them with us below.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/20/5-games-you-should-play/,5 Games You Should Play This Week,"For fans of puzzle games and dungeon crawlers, do yourself a favor and play 10000000 right now. This iOS game was just ported to PC and Mac through Steam this week, and will have you saying, ""just one more turn"" until the wee hours.  The premise of 10000000 is you find yourself trapped in a dungeon, and the only way to escape is to reach 10 million points in your dungeon run. All your actions (fighting, casting spells, and unlocking doors) all depend on matching the appropriate tiles on the game board. The first few times through you'll fail miserably, but you also collect resources and gold by matching tiles and defeating monsters, allowing you to level up your weapons and armor before trying again. The addition of 80 objectives add an extra layer to the gameplay, giving you lots of reasons to try another round. 10000000 was one of the most fun iOS games of 2012, so do yourselves a favor and pick it up at its reduced price on Steam today.
 ""Turn the Oxilator to 5!""
""Flush the Synthcage!""
""Flip the Paintings!"" If any part of yelling gibberish technobabble like this to your friends sounds appealing while frantically pressing buttons and turning dials on your iPhone, then you should definitely check out Spaceteam for iOS.  This remarkably silly free game requires two to four friends with iOS devices, along with the self-assuredness to look goofy while yelling. Spaceteam's premise is that you are all manning the controls to a spacecraft, and must bark instructions to your copilots to make it to the next warp jump.  Dials and buttons, similar to a futuristic control panel, are displayed on your phone's screen, along with an instruction at the top. Sometimes your instructions will pertain to something on your screen, but more often than not they pertain to the different dials and knobs on your friends' phones. Your only recourse is notifying them in the allotted time, so shouting something like the phrases above. Each time you hit a warp, the knobs on your screen change, meaning one of the most challenging elements of gameplay can be remembering what techno-speak actually applies to you. Games are fast-paced and hectic, and if you start missing instructions your ship's panels will start to fall apart. Spaceteam will be a hit at your next dinner party, or if you're daring, out at a bar with friends, especially for the low, low price of free. [iTunes Link]

http://mashable.com/2013/01/20/jupiter-moon-close-encounter/,See Jupiter and Moon Shine Dazzlingly Close Together Monday,"Stargazers looking up as darkness falls on Monday (Jan. 21) will notice an eye-catching pairing-off between two of the brightest objects in the nighttime sky, weather permitting. The moon, appearing as a waxing gibbous phase, 78 percent illuminated, will appear to stand close below a very bright, non-twinkling, silvery ""star."" But it won't be a star that will be keeping the moon company on America's Inauguration Night, but the largest planet in our solar system: Jupiter. Across much of the United States and southern Canada, this will be closest that the moon and Jupiter will appear relative to each other until the year 2026. On Monday night, the moon will be about of 248,700 miles (400,500 kilometers) from Earth, while Jupiter will be nearly 1,664 times farther out in space at a distance of 413.8 million miles (665.9 million km). During Monday's stargazing event, observers have the chance to see what astronomers call an appulse — a very close approach of the moon to Jupiter. An appulse is a phenomenon caused by perspective only. There is no close physical approach in space between the two objects involved. Astronomers insist that appulses have no direct effect on the Earth. The moon, moving around the Earth in an easterly direction at roughly its own diameter each hour, will creep slowly toward and ultimately pass just below the giant planet. Jupiter, meanwhile, will be shining about three times brighter than the brightest star, Sirius, offering a commanding sight for stargazers despite its close proximity to the moon.  Although it will be the moon that will be moving in Jupiter's general direction, the illusion will be that it is Jupiter that is moving, appearing to glide slowly along on a path taking it above the moon. A similar illusion occurs during a lunar eclipse when the dark shadow of Earth appears to be slowly creeping across the face of the moon. In reality it is the moon itself slowly creeping into the Earth's shadow. After their closest approach Monday, the moon will spend the balance of the night moving slowly away to the left (east), leaving Jupiter behind. From Boston, closest approach between Jupiter and the moon is at 11 p.m. EST. Separation is 0.62 of a degree or one and a quarter times the apparent width of the moon from Jupiter to the moon's upper edge. From Miami, closest approach is at 11:02 p.m. EST, the separation is listed as 0.33 of a degree or two-thirds of a moon's width separating Jupiter from the moon's upper edge. From Halifax, Nova Scotia, an asterisk indicates that the closest approach between Jupiter and the moon comes after midnight on Tuesday (Jan. 22). And here's another interesting illusion: For many places in the United States and Canada, Jupiter will be separated from the moon's upper rim by at least a half-degree (0.50) — equal to the apparent width of the moon. And yet visually to the eye, Jupiter will appear to be much closer; in fact, seemingly impossible that the gap that separates Jupiter from the moon's edge would be large enough to accommodate an object that is equal to the size of the moon itself. Even from places like Boston, Montreal and Edmonton where the gap exceeds a half-degree, Jupiter will appear much closer relative to the moon's edge. Check it out for yourself. If you own a small telescope, there are several stargazing opportunities to get a close look at Jupiter during Monday night's appearance. According to Sky & Telescope magazine, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, a colossal storm bigger than the Earth, can be visible in amateur telescopes from 9 p.m. to 10:40 p.m. EST (6 p.m. to 7:40 p.m. PST/0100 to 0240 GMT). And Jupiter's icy moon Europa will cross in front of the planet, as seen from Earth, between 8:13 p.m. and 10:37 p.m. EST (5:13 p.m. and 7:37 p.m. PST/2213 and 2337 GMT). The best time for amateur astronomers to try and spot Europa's shadow on Jupiter via telescope will be between 10:22 p.m. and 12:46 a.m. EST (7:22 p.m. and 9:46 p.m. PST/0222 and 0546 GMT), the magazine's stargazing experts said. ""You'll also get an opportunity to attempt an unusual feat: spotting Jupiter in the late afternoon, before the Sun sets,"" said Tony Flanders, associate editor at Sky & Telescope magazine and host of Skyweek on PBS, in a statement. ""First locate the moon medium-high in the east; then look a few moon-widths left or lower left of the Moon for Jupiter. It should be easy to spot with binoculars if the air is clear."" Lastly, if you are lucky to be situated across a broad swath of central South America including French Polynesia, Pitcairn and Galapagos Islands an even more spectacular event will take place, when the moon will hide or eclipse Jupiter (called an occultation). But don't fret if you miss the moon's occultation of Jupiter Monday night. Another one will occur on March 17, according to Sky and Telescope. Photo via iStockphoto, JLuizmail.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/20/kickstarter-fail-post-mortem/,Why It's OK to Fail at Kickstarter,"Zach Supalla is founder and CEO of Spark, a hardware startup making products for the connected home, starting with connected lights. Zach has a background in product design and development, and he formerly worked at Groupon and McKinsey & Company. On November 13, 2012, my company launched on Kickstarter. Thirty days later, on December 13, 2013, our Kickstarter campaign closed, with $125,588 raised from 1,601 backers. Because we had a funding threshold of $250,000, that means that the campaign was unsuccessful; credit cards will not be charged, and in a way, it's as if the campaign never happened. However, in our first three hours of re-launching with our own pre-order site, we had $20,000 in pre-orders. In our first two days, we sold half as many units as we sold in our entire 30-day campaign on Kickstarter. And our startup is most definitely not the same company it was before the campaign. We've been featured on tech and gadget websites, we've been accepted into a hardware-focused incubator called HAXLR8R and we""re speaking with a number of interested investors and business partners. It""s pretty great. In many ways, our Kickstarter campaign, despite not hitting our goal, was exactly what we needed. We got enormously valuable feedback directly from consumers and early adopters; we got great visibility; and perhaps most importantly, we learned a ton. Today I'm here to tell you what went well, where we struggled, and what we learned.  General reception to product. Before the campaign launched, I wrote in a blog post that the biggest question I wanted to answer was: When push comes to shove, will people take out their wallets, their hard-earned money, and actually buy our product? I am happy to say that the answer is a resounding yes. People like the product, they're excited about this space (the connected home), and they want more. We know our initial efforts weren't perfect (see below), but we now know that we should move forward with this product because people want it. Visibility. We were featured pretty much everywhere you could ask to be featured with a product like this. Lots and lots of people learned about us through articles in a variety of online publications, and we've got more lined up, including some long lead-time publicity-like magazines (I know; apparently some people still consume content on paper). Mostly, this happened through good old-fashioned hard work; we sent out a lot of emails (apologies to any journalist who saw me as one more email to deal with in their inbox. I love you all). Some of the publicity we got came from warm connections through investors and advisors; it's always good to have a warm lead. But mostly we got press because the journalists we spoke to said ""This looks cool,"" which proved to us that our product is cool enough to generate buzz on its own. Investors. We created a $10,000 partner level on the campaign that said, ""Hey, big spender. Let's talk."" While we did not take any equity investments during the campaign, just having this on our Kickstarter site was enormously valuable, because it helped us start conversations with a dozen different angel investors, most of whom we are continuing conversations with today. Signaling that we were interested in and open to investment was big. Branding. We want our product to represent simplicity — a new, powerful technology that's incredibly easy to use. I think we did a good job expressing this in our Kickstarter video and campaign, and when we got comments about why people prefer our product to competitors' offerings, it was often this simplicity that mattered most. We've also got some press coming up that highlights this, where our product is being featured as a ""tech product for non-geek."". As a geek myself I hope that it's also great for geeks, but when we want to see our product on the shelves at Target, the Apple store and Best Buy, it's important that we are perceived as an elegant and accessible technology.  We couldn't sell multiple units. A few weeks before we our campaign went live, Kickstarter published that â€œKickstarter Is Not A Storeâ€ post and tightened the rules and restrictions on hardware products. Most of these changes didn't affect us, but the one that hit us hard was disallowing orders of multiple units. No matter how enthusiastic our backers were, they couldn't order multiple products. Right now on our pre-order site, the average order is for 2.3 units; if the average Kickstarter backer had ordered 2.3 units, we would have blown past our goal. I respect the changes that Kickstarter made and their reasons for doing so, but it's frustrating that we can so clearly point to this rule as being the make-or-break factor for our campaign. Our funding threshold was too high. Going on Kickstarter without funding in hand is incredibly risky. Too many products fail because they realize that the funding they asked for was not enough to cover their project expenses. We worked with Dragon Innovation to come up with a realistic budget, and there was no way to get the goal down below $250,000. Why so high? Well, we were conservative with some of our assumptions, because we didn't want to take risks with customers' money. We also excluded low volume manufacturing from the get-go because our product has an integrated, custom power supply, and that is not something you want us making in our garage. In the end, we decided that the risk of not being able to deliver to backers was more important than the risk of not hitting our goal. I'm glad that we made this decision, because if we had taken a risk and set a lower goal, although we would have looked more successful, we would now be scrambling to figure out how to deliver. Our price point was too expensive. One of the challenges of being a small hardware startup is managing your Bill of Material cost; it's hard to be cost-competitive with big companies when you're manufacturing in low volumes, as every component is more expensive, and you may not have access to some low-cost technologies that require very high volumes (in our case, Wi-Fi chips). There are two strategies for managing this; either charge a higher price, knowing that you'll reduce the price point over time, or subsidize the product until you can get the costs down enough to make it profitable. As a mostly-bootstrapped startup, we couldn't subsidize our product, so we were only able to charge a higher price than we would have liked. However, during our Kickstarter campaign, we made some cost reductions to our product that made it possible for us to sell the product at a lower price of $49. Launching our product weeks after two similar products (LIFX and Philips Hue) were announced wasn't the best timing. We've got a number of advantages over both LIFX and Hue (lower cost; the ability to use any type of light bulb; better software, and a stronger app-development environment that will lead to more and better apps; no need for a ""hub"" and a new wireless technology to manage in the home). But launching directly after both of them was unfortunate bad timing. In the world of hardware launches, products are often considered on tech specs alone, and, at face value, some folks would say that because LIFX and Hue each include an LED bulb, they're better products. In the real world, user experience, distribution and reviews and references from trusted sources matter a lot more than tech specs. We're confident that we'll be able to deliver a better experience than either Hue or LIFX, but we'll have to wait until the product is delivered to prove that to our customers. And in the meantime, the feedback we've gotten helps us understand how best to communicate our differences and our advantages. In the end, I am ecstatic about the potential of our product, and I don't think I would have done anything differently with the Kickstarter campaign. We didn't do everything perfectly, but we did a lot of things right, and we're learning from our mistakes and making changes to improve our product. Although other crowdfunding platforms (most notably Indiegogo and Lockitron's fabulous Selfstarter) offer a lot more flexibility, the visibility we got on Kickstarter was unmatched, and it's that visibility and traction that is exactly the rocket fuel we needed to take our company to the next step. So what is our next step? Moving to China for four months with HAXLR8R to set up manufacturing operations; raising a private investment round; growing our company and our team. We've got big plans and we're excited about where things are going, and we wouldn't have been able to do it without Kickstarter. Image courtesy of Flickr, AMagill, Zach Supalla "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/20/kim-dotcom-mega-launch/,An Appointment With Kim Dotcom,"Paul Spain is the host of the weekly NZ Tech Podcast, one of New Zealand's leading locally produced podcasts and often appears on TV and video as a commentator on consumer and business technology topics. AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND — It’s been said that Kim Dotcom is a villain. Many, particularly those in the film industry and law enforcement, believe it. To others, he is a hero standing up for the rights of Internet users everywhere. I wanted to find out for myself where he stood. I arrived at the Dotcom Mansion early Sunday afternoon New Zealand time. It was just a few hours after the launch of Kim Dotcom’s new website Mega.co.nz and one year since his mansion was raided and he was arrested by New Zealand police in conjunction with a U.S. request to extradite him. A friendly Kim Dotcom greeted each of us in a small media gathering,  before sitting at the head of the table flanked by Ira Rothken, his California-based attorney.  I expected a  prepared statement. That wasn’t the case. Dotcom shared his excitement about the 250,000 Mega signups in the first two hours and soon led into Q&A session for the remaining 45-minutes. He proved to be extremely adept in the way he responded to questions, working effortlessly to position Mega as an innovator. He indicated a desire to help the film industry succeed in the world of digital downloads and streaming — rather than being just a company out to line its own pockets. Dotcom’s opinions and arguments for his cause were strong and generally well thought out, though on occasion seemed less robust. For instance he suggested he’d found a great way films could be funded in the future. His concept involves studios signing up digital streaming distributors around the world to fund a movie ahead of its production. He felt distributors might pay for streaming rights before production, thereby funding the production. Unfortunately, I feel revenues from streaming (now and for the foreseeable future) are typically so low this would only provide a small fraction of the funds needed to produce a movie. And who wants to risk paying up front for a movie that might be a flop? When asked about whether he would stay in New Zealand if he succeeds in stopping his extradition to the U.S. later this year, he was non-committal. On one hand he said he loved the country but on another he was worried he’d be persecuted by authorities, and in that case he’d leave. He spoke of journalists, music and movie producers on their way to visit him being harassed by customs officials upon arrival in the country –- including strip searches and even a request to view the content of one visitor’s laptop. I’ve not been able to verify these rather extreme occurrences. Dotcom has positioned Mega as a service that sits between Dropbox and his previous site Megaupload -– with the added benefits of end-to-end encryption. He and Rothken went to great lengths to highlight that Mega would operate entirely within the law. Dotcom made little effort to suggest Mega would be less prone to being a haven to copyright materials than Megaupload was. It seems there will continue to be a game of cat and mouse afoot as Dotcom and authorities try to outwit each other.  (A full audio recording of the discussion will be available later today at NZ Tech Podcast.) In a one-on-one setting with Dotcom, I tried to gain more understanding about the open source elements of the Mega service and his commitment to New Zealand. Interestingly he was reticent to provide solid answers to either question and provided what I felt were just pat answers aimed at fobbing me off. As we left the compound mid-afternoon, we saw Kim on stage rehearsing for the evening performance he would lead, with the support of musicians, his co-accused and investors in the new Mega. That performance included a dramatization of the raid on his home one year before. It was a gathering filled with media from around the country and a few from abroad. In the public context he continued to sell Mega extremely well –- to the point where someone commented to me that the event at times felt like a religious or marketing conference. Dotcom currently remains on bail until his extradition hearing due in September. Amongst those in attendance, it appeared widely accepted that the bid to extradite him from New Zealand to the U.S. is likely to fail because of mistakes made by law enforcement and New Zealand spy agency GCSB. After my visit, I’m left with a number of fairly clear impressions about Kim Dotcom and Mega. How you take these will depend on which side of the fence you stand: Mega’s management team is making every effort to operate in a manner that does not fall afoul of the law (though it could be argued they did the same with Megaupload). Mega will be used to distribute copyrighted materials such as movies, TV shows and music -– though likely to a lesser extent than Megaupload did. Kim Dotcom will continue to draw controversy and be outspoken about the rights of Internet users everywhere. He is not backing down. Love him or hate him, Kim Dotcom is back in business and, if he’s to be believed, no fair court will be able to stop him. Photos by Paul Spain "

Manly Library in Sydney posted a notice to all readers informing them that all books about Armstrong would be recategorized, The Australian reports. ""All non-fiction Lance Armstrong titles, including Lance Armstrong: Images of a Champion, The Lance Armstrong Performance Program and Lance Armstrong: World's Greatest Champion, will soon be moved to the fiction section,'' the sign says. SEE ALSO: Lance Armstrong Movie in the Works
 The library was not alone in its reassessment of the numerous printed books about Armstrong. The cyclist's autobiography, It's Not About The Bike has been the target of many disappointed reviews on Amazon this week. ""It is now clear that most everything Armstrong says is a lie,"" wrote online reviewer Jesper. ""Most of this book is based on lies and readers should consider a class action lawsuit against Armstrong, Jenkins and the publisher Berkley to get our money back for the book."" Do you think the Armstrong titles should not be categorized as fiction? Let us know in the comments. UPDATE: A council spokesperson said in a statement Monday that the sign had been a prank and libraries cannot reclassify books.

As of Jan. 21, fans can vote through the NASCAR Mobile '13 app for Android and iOS or via NASCAR.com/SprintUnlimited to choose the race's format. They can also select how many pit stops drivers are allowed, the type of pit stops, the number of cars eliminated after the race's second segment and the outfit worn by Miss Sprint Cup for Victory Lane, NASCAR's post-race show. NASCAR and Sprint officials say the promotion was born out of a desire to find a breakthrough way for sports fans to interact with a live event.  SEE ALSO: Brad Keselowski Turbocharges NASCAR's Twitter Presence [INTERVIEW]
 ""Our guiding vision since we partnered with NASCAR in 2004 has been to use technology to bring fans closer to the sport,"" Tim Considine, Sprint's director of sports marketing, tells Mashable.  ""We think the ultimate expression of fandom is actually getting to determine what exactly you're going to see,"" says Steve Phelps, NASCAR's chief marketing officer.  Fans can begin voting on Jan. 21, and votes cast through the mobile app will have twice as much value. Voting for the race format ends on Feb. 13, while voting for pit stops, number of cars eliminated and Miss Sprint Cup's Victory Lane attire won't end until after the race itself has begun on Feb. 16.  NASCAR fans are extremely passionate about their sport and also very active on social media, so this is a pretty slick promotion to get them involved. It may also start a new era of fan interactivity that will extend beyond exhibition events. Just how many fans partake in the voting, of course, remains to be seen.  Do you think this will be a hit with fans, or will it fall flat? Give us your take in the comments, below.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/20/recruit-top-talent/,5 Ways to Recruit Top Talent During Rapid Growth,"Gil Dudkiewicz is the CEO of StartApp, a platform that helps Android developers monetize and distribute their mobile app creations.
 
Paul Graham, a programmer, writer, investor and founder of Viaweb, the first software-as-a-service (SaaS) company, recently wrote an essay discussing just what makes startups uniquely poised for rapid growth. Although a startup may generally experience an initial period of slow growth while it gets its bearings in the market, once the company determines how to make something people want and how to reach them, the business will experience rapid growth — eventually growing into a very big company. During this quick-growth phase, who you hire is crucial. Here are some ways to recruit top talent. Startups can take a cue from other industry contenders to come out on the other side of the growth phase with a winning team. Often, a period of rapid growth makes hiring the best candidates difficult. But the key to making successful hires is focusing 90% on networking and only 10% on headhunting and HR companies.
 
Networking does magic in terms of landing the right fit for a company's culture. The best strategy is to first ensure employees really believe in your mission and enjoy working there. If they do, they'll act as your ambassadors. They'll bring their friends, and all will feel committed to the company's mission and to growing your team.
 
Groupon, which grew from 37 to 7,100 employees in 21 months, also recommends using employee networks to gather referrals.
 
""About 40% of new hires come from employees — that works especially well from top performers,"" Dan Jessup, head of hiring at Groupon since 2009, told CNN. ""Equip yourself with as much data as you can, then acknowledge that the hiring decision will still be subjective.""
 
For networking purposes, Groupon also uses tracking software that easily integrates with sites like Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook — something any rapidly-growing company can take advantage of. Other startups face the challenge of landing talent who are also being recruited by other companies. Megan Hopkins, director of human resources at VigLink, a startup web monetization company, says there are no guarantees in the world of tech startup recruiting. Viglink recently landed an impressive $5.4 million in startup funding, meaning the company has to continually compete with other rapidly growing startups for the best candidates.
 
When trying to land all-star talent, you have to go the extra mile, Hopkins says. Her team recently signed and sent a birthday card to a candidate who wouldn't start for another two months. Hopkins also suggests making friends in the industry so as to avoid being badmouthed by competitive recruiters. If a candidate doesn't work out for you, refer them to another startup to build your reputation as an ally in the industry. This may seem like a strange strategy, but it's worked for rapidly-growing blog icanhazcheezburger.com. The popular blog — which boasts 16.5 million unique visitors per month and more than 375 million page views — recently snagged $30 million in a round of venture funding, which it will use to build its staff. Ben Huh, CEO of Cheezburger, believes that companies can find the best employees if they advertise a job with low pay. ""We advertise lower wages for entry-level positions because the worst candidates focus on money the most,"" Huh explained on his blog. ""Believe it or not, advertising lower-than-market wages actually helped us yield better candidates. Higher advertised wages resulted in much higher level of noise from candidates who really didn't care about the job. (FYI: Advertised pay and actual pay are two different things.)""
 
Bad candidates focus on money, Huh contends, and the best candidates just want to land a job that will make them feel happy and accomplished. This is one strategy rapidly-growing companies can use to weed out the wrong candidates. Although competition to land top candidates can be fierce, dealing with the continuous internal changes of a rapidly-growing company can be the hardest part about recruiting for a startup. For example, my company has doubled its team every six months since its founding in 2010, making managing new candidates difficult.
 
In many cases, managing growth is harder than managing crisis. An important tip is to not be afraid to hire people who are better than you. Nearly everyone I've hired is better in what he or she does than I am. It may be challenging at times, but hiring candidates who are better than you will help your company's growth throughout time. At Groupon, some Saturdays are set aside for mass interviewing, so every hiring manager is focused. ""Groupon hires fast by having internal recruiters partner with hiring managers,"" Jessup explains. ""I am also always identifying and moving roadblocks. What worked seven months ago won't work today.""
 
Rapidly-growing startups need to consider all of these implications when scouring for new hires. Networking, forging industry contacts, building your reputation, and not being afraid to hire those who are smarter than you can be the key to landing the best fit.  Though these moves can be difficult, nothing will compare to the feeling of finally creating a solid team that will help your startup succeed throughout its growth phase and beyond.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/20/resume-killers/,Resume Killers: 3 Things That Will Get Your Resume Thrown in the Trash,"You know all about getting your resume noticed. Clean layout! Accomplishments, not duties! But do you know what's on the flipside? What could you be doing that could cause recruiters to overlook your resume — or worse, toss it in the trash? Gasp! The trash? I know what you're thinking, but the truth is, recruiters have dozens, even hundreds, of resumes to comb through every day. So, in an effort to cull them down to a reasonable amount, they'll simply toss any that don't meet what they're looking for. To learn more, I sat down with a few recruiters and asked them about the resumes that make the cut and those that get tossed. Here are three of their deal-breakers. First and foremost, review the requirements listed in the job description and confirm that you have the skills and experience the recruiter is looking for. This is the ""first knockout factor"" for many, says Christina Lord, a technical recruiter at Dealer.com. ""Make sure you look at the requirements before applying to the job, and identify if your skills are a match,"" she says. Sounds basic, but job seekers make this mistake more often than you might think, thanks to career counselors and advice websites that say to go ahead and apply for a job even without all of the qualifications. And while you shouldn't be afraid to aim high, no amount of resume tailoring will cover for the fact that you only have three years of management experience, not 10, or don't have the technical skills required to do the job. ""Resumes just won't be considered if the basic skills aren't there,"" agrees Joanna Thomas, a human resources professional at an agency in Burlington, VT. A similar mistake: You have the basic requirements, but they're obscured by extra or unnecessary information. ""Lay it out simply for me — that means less investigation I'll have to do,"" says Thomas. For example, if you're applying for a position in marketing, but your experience is a combination of marketing and sales, tailor your resume to focus on your marketing experience and skills, and minimize — or even remove — the sales information. It's of utmost importance to recruiters to find a candidate who's a ""cultural fit as well as a skill set fit,"" according to Thomas. They love when a candidate ""gets it"" —  and they'll toss your resume if you look like ""just someone looking for a job."" (Think summary statements that cover a wide range of skills and industries, or cover letters that don't mention the company by name — or at all.) To avoid the circular file, you'll want to tweak your resume based on the position and company. You need to make deliberate connections of how your experience, skills, and personality are a perfect fit for the job. Use industry terms, spell out accomplishments that you know will make an impact, and don't be afraid to let your personality shine through. Thomas remembers an applicant who listed, ""I'll drink an iced Americano any time, day or night"" under the interests section, which not only revealed the applicant's ""personality and sense of humor,"" it was a great fit for Thomas' agency, a highly creative design firm with its own specialty coffee shop in the basement. When it comes to your resume, the devil is quite often in the details. Recruiters get annoyed by small things that you may not think of — like whether or not the text on your cover letter and resume is the same font and size (it should be), if your margins are off (makes it tricky for us to print), or to whom you've addressed the cover letter (it should be the recruiter's name, not ""sir,"" ""madam,"" or ""to whom it may concern"". And be sure to avoid the worst typo in history: ""Dear Sir or Madman:"". They'll also take note if you don't include everything the job posting asks you to send. A cover letter and resume? What about work or writing samples? Be sure to include everything that's asked of you. Also, does the job posting refer to the position as Project Manager II? If so, state that in your cover letter, exactly — don't write Proj. Mgr. or Project Manager. Companies put a lot of time into determining job titles, and when a recruiter is looking to fill both the Project Manager and the Project Manager II positions, any ambiguity from you will make it harder for them. And, it should go without saying, but ""one spelling error and I'm out,"" says Thomas. Proofreading your own resume is a must, but don't rely on spell check and grammar check alone — ask family or friends to take a look at it for you. Lord recommends that you ""always, always have several eyes look at your resume."" Applying for a job can often feel like a huge challenge, and knowing that there are so many applicants out there can be daunting. But if you follow these simple rules, you'll make sure your resume gets past the first hurdle: the trash can. Better yet, if you tailor your resume and make sure it's a fit to the company and job, you'll definitely increase your chances of getting to the top of the pile. Photo via iStockphoto, Johnrob

http://mashable.com/2013/01/20/smart-home/,5 Connected Objects to Smarten Up Your Home,"Kickstarter-funded Ninja Blocks are wirelessly connected mini-computers embedded with a range of sensors that can detect humidity, temperature, motion, light and distance, among other things. Using Ninja Blocks' accompanying software system, you can communicate with a range of systems through SMS, Twitter, Foursquare, Evernote and more. You could, for instance, program your Ninja to text you when someone rings your (wireless) doorbell; turn on the light by talking to Siri; tweet at you when your pet's water bowl runs dry; or, when motion is detected in your garage, take a photo from your webcam and upload it to Dropbox.  Introductory kits cost $199 and will resume shipping in March. More affordable alternatives include Knut and Twine, both of which cost $99 but have fewer sensors and capabilities than Ninja Blocks. You can purchase a range of add-ons sensors and connected devices for the Knut, however, including sensors for moisture and water pressure, as well as a magnetic door switch, for $25 apiece. Imagine being able to open and close your front door with a tap on your phone. Come May, you'll be able to do that with Lockitron, a $179, Internet-connected device designed to fit over your deadbolt.  You can lock and unlock your doors from anywhere using a two-button iPhone app or a text message. You can authorize family members (and visiting guests) so they can open your doors, as well. Sensors alert you when someone has unlocked or knocked on your door. It's easy to install and unlike many other home automation systems, doesn't require any internal wiring, and thus, works in renters' homes, too. Nest is an intelligent, elegantly designed thermostat system from the creators of Apple's iPod. You can adjust the temperature using the dial on the thermostat or on its companion apps for iOS or Android devices. Over time, the app will learn your preferences -- shutting off the heat when you head for work, for example, and ticking up 10 degrees when your kids come home from school.  ""Teach it well and Nest can lower your heating and cooling bills up to 20%,"" its creators pledge.  A basic unit costs $249 on Nest's website; thermostats are also available at Amazon.com as well as at Apple and Lowe's stores. The company also offers professional installation, starting at $119 for one thermostat and $25 for each additional unit. Bitponics, a Kickstarter-backed ""personal gardening assistant,"" aims to give hydroponic plant growers better control over their soil-free indoor gardens, via an Internet-connected sensor device. You can use Bitponics' software (still in development) to devise plans for growing different kinds of plants, determining the amount of light hours your plants need each day, when to replace your nutrient solution, when to run your water pumps, etc. Sensors for temperature, humidity, brightness and pH will log data about your plants and alert you when something's wrong.  Bitponics pledges to release its first batch of systems (priced around $395) in September. At $6,400, Kohler's Numi Toilet (brilliantly reviewed by Sam Grobart in The New York Times) is a bit out of the average homeowner's budget. Nevertheless, it's an impressive device: It has a motion-activated lid for hands-free opening and closing and an integrated air dryer and deodorizer. Plus, it heats both the seat and foot area. Ambience lighting and built-in speakers, which can be pre-programmed or connected to an MP3 player via remote docking station, round out the experience. Imagine waking up in a fully automated home. The light on your nightstand gradually begins to brighten, your blinds unfold to welcome the morning light, coffee brews in the kitchen and music begins to play, all without you lifting a finger. Until recently, even partially automated homes were exclusive to the domains of engineers and home owners wealthy enough to hire them (or creative students with some extra time on their hands). But now those systems are becoming more affordable and easier to manage, thanks in part to Kickstarter-fueled interest in ""The Internet of Things,"" as well as integrations with SMS, smartphones and web-based applications like Twitter and Dropbox.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/20/target-super-bowl-mobile-game/,Target Skips Super Bowl Commercial in Favor of Mobile Game,"On Feb. 3, big brands and their agencies will line up to compete for what they hope will be remembered as the best TV commercial for Super Bowl XLVII, spending tens of millions of dollars in the process. One major retailer, Target, will be sitting on the sidelines, having developed a more modest (and budget-friendly) mobile game instead. Snack Bowl, which can be played on mobile web browsers as well as downloadable apps for iPhone and Android devices, is pretty basic. You're awarded points for tossing a carousel of branded snacks, including DiGiorno pizza and Coke Zero, to your jersey-wearing guests, who are inexplicably running across your living room one by one. Your guests move faster and faster, making the game increasingly difficult. Fail to feed three of your guests and it's game over. To spread awareness of the game, players are encouraged to challenge their Facebook friends to beat their high scores.  The idea for Snack Bowl was developed internally, fed by the success of earlier mobile games Target has developed for various holidays, Eddie Baeb, a spokesperson for Target, told Mashable. ""We're viewing digital as a lot more than shopping online — it's an opportunity to connect with guests better,"" said Baeb. The game will be promoted on the landing page of Target's mobile site and on its flagship mobile apps, as well as through paid mobile advertising, including search. Although the game really falls in the branding (rather than direct-selling) category, its landing page does link to shopping pages for TVs and fan gear on Target's website. Image via Target. "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/20/wikileaks-aaron-swartz/,Wikileaks Says Aaron Swartz Was a Possible Source,"In a series of tweets, Wikileaks claimed Saturday that late Internet activist and hacker Aaron Swartz was an ally and possible source for the organization. It also disclosed that Swartz, who committed suicide last week, was ""in communication"" with founder Julian Assange during 2010 and 2011. Wikileaks, which exposes classified information provided by anonymous sources, said it decided to reveal these details in light of the U.S. Secret Service's involvement in Swartz's case. At the time of his death, Swartz was awaiting trial for allegedly harvesting millions of scholarly articles over the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's network. He was charged with computer fraud and other crimes in July 2011, and faced up to 35 years in prison. Due to the investigation into the Secret Service involvement with #AaronSwartz we have decided to disclose the following facts (1-3) — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) January 19, 2013 The Secret Service took over Swartz's case two days prior to his arrest, according The Verge. Although Wikileaks doesn't elaborate on its decision, the organization has a policy of maintaining anonymity for its sources. ""As far as we can ascertain, Wikileaks has never revealed any of its sources,"" according to its website. ""We cannot provide details about the security of our media organization or its anonymous drop box for sources because to do so would help those who would like to compromise the security of our organization and its sources.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/amazon-woos-advertisers-with-what-it-knows-about-consumers/,Amazon Woos Advertisers With What It Knows About Consumers,"Google built its $38 billion business selling ads based on how people search and browse the web. Facebook, too, uses what it knows about its one billion users to sell targeted ads. But when it comes to what many advertisers value most — what people actually buy, or what they may want to buy soon — there may be no better data than the information in Amazon's 152 million customer accounts. Since last year, the world's largest online retailer has been packaging information on what it knows about consumers so that some marketers can use it to make split-second decisions about where to buy ads online and how much to pay for them. This automated process occurs on real-time ad exchanges that sell ad impressions as a person loads a web page. When this process began, Amazon used third-party technology, and its experiments were limited. Now it has developed an in-house platform for targeting ads to people who have visited and then left Amazon’s sites, making it likely that the company will open up these advertising services more widely over the next year. ""Today, if you’re browsing the web, you might see an Amazon advertisement based on Amazon’s data. Tomorrow, you may see an ad from Coca-Cola based on Amazon data, and it’ll run through the Amazon platform,"" says Jeff Green, CEO of the Trade Desk, which helps guide spending decisions by ad agencies. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment about its advertising business, and the company does not break out its advertising revenue. But it’s clear that compared to Google and Facebook, advertising has been a relatively small and low-key business for Amazon. It brought in about $500 million of Amazon’s $48 billion in revenue in 2011, Baird & Co. senior research analyst Colin Sebastian estimates. Mostly this came from selling ads on its own websites. But Amazon could soon generate much more than that with an advertising network that reaches onto many other sites. For years, Amazon has put algorithms to work in order to recommend products to people who are on its sites. Now other companies are eager to find out exactly how Amazon’s knowledge about consumers can help them find the best audiences for their ads, says Kip Voytek, digital innovation director at the advertising firm MDC Partners. Amazon would be unlikely to directly give advertisers access to its trove of information about individuals’ browsing, purchasing, and product review histories, both because of its privacy policies and a desire to keep its valuable data proprietary. Instead, Amazon would create target audiences, such as people who recently purchased digital cameras. A marketer selling digital camera accessories could then use Amazon’s technology to bid for the ability to show ads to a person in that category. Green points out that while Google might have more overall data about consumers, Amazon’s data could be more valuable for advertisers. Amazon has “a pretty clear understanding of the things I buy. They’ve learned a lot about me. Every time I’m convinced I have another medical ailment, I go to Google. But Amazon, what they have is really about my purchase intent,” he says. Using its data to expand its advertising business could open up new fronts of competition with Google, which also owns a real-time bidding exchange and an ad-delivery network. But Amazon might be mainly interested in using its ad technology to help the retailers that sell products on its sites and through its Kindle tablets and e-readers. Voytek put it this way: “The question that is open: is this Amazon competing with Google or is this Amazon competing with Walmart?” Image courtesy of Flickr, kodomut

http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/atari-bankruptcy/,"Atari Files For Bankruptcy, Company Hopes to Remain Intact","Classic video game maker Atari filed for bankruptcy late Sunday night in an attempt to break away from its financially troubled French parent company. According to a press release from Atari, its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing is a move to distance itself from Atari S.A., formerly called Infogrames, which it has been affiliated with since 2003. Atari seeks to find a new buyer for its classic video game franchises, including Pong, Breakout, and Centipede, and its logo, one of the most recognizable video game logos to consumers. Atari has recently switched its focus into the mobile space, releasing remakes and collections of its franchises on iOS and Android. Some of the more popular releases include Atari Greatest Hits and Astroid Gunner. Atari also licensed Breakout to social game giant Zynga to make Super Bunny Breakout for mobile.  These successful mobile games helped Atari S.A. to remain profitable during 2011 and 2012, but the company is still mired in debt, according to the Los Angeles Times.  SEE ALSO: The History of Atari [INFOGRAPHIC] Atari has had a tumultuous history as company. Started by Nolan Bushnell in 1972, it was originally responsible for putting Pong machines in bars and other businesses around the country, and popularizing video games in America. They created one of the most popular home consoles of the time: the Atari 2600. When the video games market crashed in 1984, the company was split and sold off. After several failed attempts to repeat its console success, the company was then sold to Hasbro in 1998. That arrangement only lasted a few years, until Hasbro Interactive was purchased by French company Infogrames, which then changed the name to Atari. Atari will operate business-as-usual while the bankruptcy proceedings continue. Image courtesy Flickr, moparx. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/baclberryz10-versus-iphone-5/,"BlackBerry Z10 Looks Like iPhone 5, Takes on Siri"," RIM is set to announce the first devices running its new BlackBerry 10 operating system at an event on January 30. A lucky few, however, have already gotten their hands on what looks to be the new hardware, including German site TelekomPresse. The site has the BlackBerry Z10, a touchscreen device with a similar look to some of the other popular smartphones out there — especially the iPhone 5. Curious to see how the two compared, they put them side-by-side in the video above, running through both the physical design of both devices as well as some of their features. Notably, the video shows a Siri-like voice control functionality in BlackBerry 10, that we haven’t seen previously. As you can see in the test above, it beats Siri for speed. SEE ALSO: RIM Adds 15,000 BlackBerry 10 Apps in a Weekend While similar at first glance, design-wise the two phones do have some differences. The Z10 has a 4.2-inch screen, slightly larger than the iPhone 5’s 4-inch display. Both phones have a power button on top, however, the button on the BlackBerry is in the center of the top of the phone, while the iPhone’s is on the right on the device.   The volume controls are on the right side of the Z10, and left side of the iPhone 5. When it comes to power, the connection for the iPhone 5 is on the bottom of the device with the headphone jack, while the HDMI and USB connections on the Z10 are located on the left. Check out the video above for a look at the full comparison of the two devices. Are you looking forward to BlackBerry 10? Can the new OS save RIM? Let us know your thoughts in the comments. You unlock a BlackBerry 10 device by swiping up from the bottom of the screen. When you swipe up, the lock screen dissolves into the home screen on the device. Swiping to the side brings up additional pages of apps. You can also navigate through pages of apps by tapping on the scroll bar on the bottom of the screen. Taking a page from Windows Phone, RIM is adding “Active Frames” to BB10. Much like the ""Live Tiles” found in Windows Phone, the frames update with information you can see at a glance. For instance, the weather app will show the current temperature as well as a 7-day forecast, the calendar app shows your next event for the day. BlackBerry Hub can be accessed by swiping across the screen. Contact cards include phone numbers, email addresses and social-networking details. RIM is taking the look and feel of its home screen and bringing it into groups. Active frames make an appearance in groups, allowing you to see chats pertaining to a particular group, people who are a part of the group, and photos that have been uploaded. Pictures change as they are uploaded to the group, so if someone uploads a new one then that image will change on the group's page. Tapping on a person in a group will bring up his or her contact card. Taking photos in BlackBerry 10 starts out much like taking photos with any other OS, with the ability to tap on any portion of the photo to focus on a specific portion of the frame. If a photo you take is blurry, or someone in the picture has his or her eyes closed, you can use the scroll bar on the bottom of the screen to move forward and backward in time to capture the perfect shot. Much like you can adjust a whole picture, you can also pic out individual faces in a photo to adjust. So, if one friend has her eyes closed in a picture, you can just adjust herface in the photo. "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/eric-schmidt-north-korea/,Here’s What Google's Eric Schmidt Said About North Korea,"Not everyone was happy with Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt's trip to North Korea or its secretive nature. Now we have details about what the whole thing was about.  Schmidt posted on his Google+ account this morning, and said the goal was to talk to North Korea about a free and open Internet. The reason many people suspected Schmidt was making the trip was to increase Google's market into the country, but why can't it be both? Google would no doubt get one of its many fingers into an open North Korean Internet, so it could be a classic win-win for Google and the North Korean people. In his Google+ post, Schmidt said that he was shown the mostly Linux-based software and technology that controlled the supervised Internet in North Korea, and mentioned that only the government, military, and universities had access to it. When Schmidt said the Internet was supervised, it seems he meant it literally. He wrote, ""There is a supervised Internet and a Korean Intranet. (It appeared supervised in that people were not able to use the Internet without someone else watching them). There's a private intranet that is linked with their universities. Again, it would be easy to connect these networks to the global Internet."" It seems like to use the Internet in North Korea at all, someone has to physically stand over your shoulder and watch what you are doing. That adds a real level of tension when you're trying to communicate about sensitive subjects, or watch adorable cat videos. There is an existing 3G network in the country, but it is not currently connected to the Internet. Making that connection, Schmidt says, would be ""very easy"" and he notes that there are already one and half million phones in the country that would be able to access the Internet through a 3G connection, with growth planned in the future. Schmidt obviously has something to gain by North Korea opening up the Internet, since it's likely that citizens would start using some Google products, but he also says it's good for North Korea itself to open up. Schmidt wrote, ""As the world becomes increasingly connected, the North Korean decision to be virtually isolated is very much going to affect their physical world and their economic growth. It will make it harder for them to catch up economically."" An open Internet allows growth and communication, and Schmidt says that if North Korea doesn't open its Internet to citizens they will fall behind. [Via Google+] Photo via Getty Images/AFP, Ed Jones

Facebook Poke hit #1 on Apple's list of free apps in the U.S. the following day, but it didn't hold onto the top spot long, dropping out of the top 25 less than a week later. Now, one month after it launched, Poke has fallen out of the top 50, the top 500 and is well on its way to falling out of the top 1,000 free apps. As of Monday, Facebook Poke had dropped to number 706 on the list of Apple's top free apps, according to data from App Annie, a service that tracks app rankings.    Snapchat, far from being killed off by Facebook, enjoyed a big boost from all the extra attention on its app. As Facebook Poke fell out of the top 25, Snapchat managed to crack the top 5 apps, rising to as high as #3. Snapchat has since declined somewhat in the rankings, but is still firmly in the top 20 at #14.  Snapchat's continued popularity suggests that the demand is still there for this kind of messaging app — just not for Facebook Poke. Image courtesy of iStockphoto, CWLawrence and App Annie "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/financial-times-digital-first/,'FT' Announces Job Cuts as it Shifts Focus From Print,"Twenty-five positions will be eliminated at the Financial Times as the paper shifts resources from print to digital, FT Editor Lionel Barber announced Monday. In a memo e-mailed to staff, Barber said the FT needs to spend less money (and time) producing the paper so it can invest in improving its online presence. ""We need to ensure that we are serving a digital platform first, and a newspaper second,"" he wrote. ""Our common cause is to secure the FT's future in an increasingly competitive market, where old titles are being routinely disrupted by new entrants such as Google and LinkedIn and Twitter,"" he explained. ""Our competitors are harnessing technology to revolutionise the news business through aggregation, personalisation and social media. Mobile alone, for example, now accounts for 25 per cent of all the FT's digital traffic. It would be reckless for us to stand still,"" he said, adding that ""deep and original reporting"" based on ""multiple sources"" and a ""sharp eye for scoop[s]"" would remain important. As part of the shift, the FT will hire for 10 new digital positions, and alter time schedules so that less people are working at night on the next morning's edition, and more are publishing online during the day. If 2013 seems like a late date for a newspaper to announce a ""digital-first"" strategy, you're right. The Atlantic Media Company has been singing that slogan for more than six years now, and annual spending on digital advertising has already surpassed print, according to eMarketer's calculations. Heavy revenue losses have forced others, in a way, to act more quickly than the FT, which fought the ongoing slump in print advertising by installing an online paywall as early as 2001 and raising subscription prices in the years since. Though the FT's operations have continued to prioritize print, the paper already has more digital-only subscribers than print ones. The FT is asking for voluntary buyouts, and will take ""further steps"" to reduce staff by 25 if necessary, Barber said. Photo courtesy of The Financial Times "

Whatever your price is, it's probably not as much as NASCAR team owner Rick Hendrick's, who just laid down more than a million bucks for the car. Hendrick bid $1.05 million for the first Stingray to come off GM's production lines — model 0001 — at the Barrett-Jackson car collector event in Scottsdale, Az., Road & Track reports. The money will be donated to the College for Creative Studies in Detroit. Charitable contributions aside, the price is exorbitant. While Chevrolet hasn't announced the final price of the new Corvette, it has said it'll be close to what current Corvettes cost now, which run about $50,000. Hendrick has paid a lot of money to be first in line for other Chevy cars, according to the Latinos Post. His winning $350,000 bid at a Las Vegas auction got him the first 2010 Camaro SS, and he also won the first 2011 Corvette Z06 Carbon Edition. SEE ALSO: Carbon Fiber: The Secret of the 2014 Corvette Stingray
 GM unveiled the 2014 Corvette Stingray last week. Released for the 50th anniversary of the car, the new model is the seventh generation of the iconic sports car and shares just two parts with the previous generation. The new Corvette departs from its predecessors with muscular lines, carbon-fiber parts, redesigned (and controversially rectangular) tail lights, and a retractable dashboard LCD. We got a chance to check out (but not drive) the new Corvette when it paid a visit to New York City, and although it's a beautiful car, we wouldn't pay a million bucks to be the first person to drive one. Would you? Tell us in the comments. The new Corvette features a top-to-bottom redesign of the iconic sports car. Now built out of aluminum and carbon fiber instead of steel, it's lighter and has more horsepower -- 450 to the 2013 model's 430. No price yet, but Chevy says it'll be in the neighborhood of current Corvettes with start around $50,000. The 2014 Corvette has a new logo as well. One of the more controversial aspects of the redesign is the back end, which ditches the circular tail lights that have been around since the first Corvette in 1953 for something more modern. The Stingray logo, not used since the 1970s, also got a makeover. The 2014 Corvette dashboard includes two HD screens, one of which retracts at the touch of a buttton. The interior design got a makeover, too, with ""adrenaline red"" seat coloring as an option. The Corvette has been redesigned only six times, for a grand total of seven generations of the car, including the 2014 model. This is the one that started it all. Photo by Mashable, Pete Pachal "

It cleans not only your phone but your iPod, earbuds, anything that will fit into the basket.  The Violight Toothbrush Sanitizer makes sure you're not getting those nasty flu germs from your partner's toothbrush when they snuggle in the cup at night. The sanitizer kills 99.9% of germs. The CleanWave is great for use on desktops, computer keyboards, remote controls and phones. The UV-C light wand says it kills up to 99.9% of germs. Here's one way to get the germs off a keyboard, wash it with soap and hot water. Logitech's Washable Keyboard can go for a dunk to remove the gunk.  The handheld, battery-operated Nano Scanner says it can protect you from infectious diseases from common cold and flu viruses to more serious viruses such as Asian bird flu, SARS viruses and E. coli. Vioguard's anti-bacterial keyboard works like a turtle. When not in use, it retracts into its housing where two germicidal 25-watt ultraviolet lights bake bacteria, viruses, and mold in seconds. The technology kills at least 99.99% of bugs like flu, MRSA, and other contagions. Purely Product's Pocket Purifier uses ultraviolet light to eliminate 99.9% of germs that cause colds and flu, mold, fungus and other germs. The UV light in the handheld device deactivates the DNA of bacteria, viruses and other pathogens, destroying their ability to multiply. Small enough for moms to throw in a diaper bag to sanitize baby toys and changing surfaces. Purely's Healthy Night Light has a built-in ionizer so it freshens the air in the room while it provides light. It generates negative ions which remove dust and mold from the room.  Have you been sidelined by the flu yet? If so, you have our sympathies. It's a particularly bad year — so bad that many of you have taken to social media to complain heartily about it. If you've managed to avoid coming down with the flu thus far, good for you! If you want to stay healthy, you'll want to follow traditional advice and perhaps take a close look at these devices in the gallery above that promise to zap the flu germs from the items you use every day.  SEE ALSO: 6 Apps For Surviving Flu Season We know the flu can spread every time you touch something that has the pesky germs on it, and then touch your mouth or nose. Experts say the flu bug can live on surfaces anywhere from a few minutes to a few days. Luckily, there are devices like the Pocket Purifier which let you zap a cellphone or desk area with UV light, killing 99.9% of the germs. Use these on your phone, your keyboards, or any hard surface.  Technology is all around us, and so are surfaces just waiting to host the bacteria and transfer it to your warm hands. Think about all the things you touch in a day. Keyboards, on average, have 60 times more germs on them than toilet seats. It might be the season for a washable keyboard. While you probably won't be waving a UV scanner around a crowded subway car, you can protect yourself in other ways. Personal contact with an infected person is the most common way these germs spread so if you hang onto a subway poll or touch stair rails and doorknobs that others have touched, you're going want to wash your hands a lot. For items you come in contact with more frequently, check out the gallery above to see what you can use to keep your stuff germ-free, and you healthy. Thumbnail image courtesy of violight "

Then again, ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos deserved the digital roasting he got on Monday morning after flubbing the ID of a very famous spectator at President Obama's inauguration ceremony.  ""That's Morgan Freeman, I think,"" Stephanopoulos eagerly exclaimed as ABC's cameras zoomed in on the white-bearded African American man pictured above.  The only problem? That is, in fact, Bill Russell — who, despite also being African American and sporting facial hair is a pretty famous fellow in his own right. Russell is an NBA Hall of Famer who was the centerpiece of 11 championship teams for the Boston Celtics in the 1950s and 1960s — which is why that Celtics cap atop his head makes perfect sense for him, but would be a rather strange fashion choice for Mr. Freeman.   After a brief moment of realization — or prodding from ABC's production truck — Stephanopoulos quickly corrected his mistaken ID. But it was already too late, as the Internet's frothing crowd of gleeful correctors was off and running. Clips and the close-captioned screenshot above have circulated widely on sports blogs and Twitter.  For Stephanopoulos, a momentary slip-up. For the social web, a fleeting moment of happy derision. And for white people everywhere, just one more addition to a long standing tradition of cringe-inducing un-coolness.

Rarest of all, though, may be the random intersection of a New York City subway rider and Google Glass-wearing Sergey Brin. Until now.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/google-removes-make-me-asian-app/,Google Removes 'Make Me Asian' App After Protests of Racism,"""Make Me Asian,"" an app that allowed users to slant their eyes and don a rice paddy hat, received much backlash over its stereotypical depictions. On Thursday, Google pulled the app from its Play Store after thousands signed an online petition calling for its removal.  App developer KimberyDeiss created the face-changing application which yellowed users' skin and decorated faces with a Fu Manchu mustache.  ""You can for a few seconds to make (yourself) a Chinese, Japanese, Korean or any other Asians,"" the description said, according to CNN.  Another app by the same developer, called ""Make Me Indian,"" broadened a person's nose, gave them long black hair, war paint and a feathered headband. Peter Chin, a pastor in Washington D.C., organized an online petition on change.org, calling out Google for perpetuating racism.  ""I've seen characterizations like this before, but I thought it particularly dangerous that it was an app and on Google Play,"" Chin tells Mashable. ""It made me afraid that the characterizations would be normalized more than I would like."" Online activist group 18 Million Rising joined the effort with their own petition and spread of the hashtag, #makemeracist. More than 10,000 people signed the petitions, and activists tweeted the campaign to Asian-American celebrities, including Aziz Ansari and Kal Penn.  Though it is unconfirmed whether or not Google removed the apps as a direct result of the petitions, Google released a statement to CNN saying, ""We don't comment on individual apps. We remove apps from Google Play that violate our policies.""  Their developer program policy prohibits hate speech, specifically the promotion of hatred toward groups of people based on factors including race and ethnic origin. No apps were found on Google Play Store under KimberyDeiss' username.  Chin was unable to reach anyone directly at Google, despite numerous attempts over more than three months. Pairing social media with the online petition set the foundation of the effort, he says.  ""It was clear it was a very opaque process with no feedback or way to gauge that anyone was listening,"" Chin says. ""I completely understand Google's concerns about free speech but at the same time they have corporate responsibilities and they have to balance things out. I'm really thankful it all came together and am encouraged to hear their response actualized."" Does this hold any changes for apps like ""Fatbooth"" or ""Make Me Old?""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/guardian-australia/,Why 'The Guardian' Is Forgoing Paywalls — For Now,"Following The New York Times' recent success, online paywalls (particularly the metered-access kind) have been popping up on newspaper websites across the globe. In the U.S. alone, nearly half of all newspapers now have some sort of online paywall, according to estimates from the Alliance for Audited Media. In the UK, adoption has been slower, though many of the country's leading dailies — The Times, The Independent, The Financial Times and The Daily Telegraph among them — now require a paying subscription for full digital access, including mobile. As mentioned, the uptake in paywalls, particularly in the U.S., can be largely attributed to the NYT's widely publicized success with its metered-access subscription model. According to Evercore Partners, the strategy generated $91 million for the paper in 2012, helping offset continuing declines in print and digital advertising, and ensuring that the NYT's financial future is less dependent on the ups, downs and whims of the advertising industry. The Guardian, however, is taking another route. In a refreshingly lucid statement published to The Economist's Leanback 2.0 blog, Andrew Miller, CEO of the Guardian Media Group, explains why a paywall isn't ""one size fits all,"" and why it doesn't fit with the Guardian's current plans — namely, to significantly boost its readership and advertising revenue internationally, and to reduce its cost base by £25 million over the next five years. Miller wrote: In some news organisations where growth in readership may not be so important and in particular where there is a strong existing print subscriber base to build on, a pure paywall may make excellent business sense. The Economist and perhaps the Times spring to mind here. It also makes sense in other publications which feature business-critical information – for example, the Financial Times and, in the Australian context, the AFR.   At the Guardian we will continue to look at, monitor and offer a blend of options, including paywalls, depending on the product we are offering. But at the same time we have to recognise that digital advertising is not yet able to fill the substantial gap between any paywall revenues and the cost of the operation — not least because advertising agencies have not yet fully aligned their spend with changing patterns in media consumption. But how to get from where we are today to where we need to be?  The main thrust of our strategy is to invest in our digital audience and revenue growth, while optimising the newspaper’s contribution in terms of both format and pricing and, crucially, managing our cost base to a level that is sustainable in the long term. Miller's explanation accompanied the Guardian's announcement that it plans to set up an online operation in Sydney, Australia, later this year. The move into Australia, which is being funded in part by entrepreneur and Global Mail chair Graeme Wood, follows the establishment of a newsroom in New York less than two years ago. Since then, the Guardian has grown its online American readership by nearly a quarter — from 8 million uniques in Feb. 2011 to 10.9 million in Dec. 2012, according to comScore. (The publication brought in a record 11.8 million uniques in Oct. 2012, surpassing the BBC's American audience for the first time, comScore said.) The Guardian now has 40 staffers in the U.S., roughly two-thirds of which are in editorial, according to Miller. Why Australia, and why now? In a phone interview earlier this week, Miller recalled that when he joined the Guardian two years ago, he was struck by the fact that two-thirds of its readership was outside the UK. The largest international audience ""by a long way"" resided in North America, followed by Australia; so, it made sense to try to grow audiences in those areas first. The launches have also been timed to align with political elections in each country — the perfect moment for the Guardian to strengthen its voice in each region, Miller said.  In a follow-up conversation, I asked Miller if he was at all nervous that the Guardian is currently so dependent on advertising for revenue when other publications, such as the NYT, have made efforts to diversify their revenue streams through circulation income. He said he was confident in the Guardian's knowledge of its audience and its ability to ""sell [that] audience properly to the advertising community.""  He added that the publication is also bringing in revenue through events, as well as through e-commerce offerings (such as this one). What's more, the Guardian may not always be ""closed off to paywalls,"" particularly on handsets, Miller said. (At present, UK readers must have a Guardian subscription for access to its iPhone and iPad apps, but elsewhere — including the U.S — access is free.) A browser paywall simply wouldn't align with the Guardian's current aim to grow its readership.  I asked Miller what he'd learned from the U.S. launch that he now planned to apply to Australia.  ""One of the most important things is to do really interesting editorial content,"" he said, pointing to a number of interactive graphics (such as this one on gay rights, shown above) that were built locally by the Guardian's U.S. team. To do it, ""you've got to find local talent and build [that content] locally,"" he added. Where could the Guardian go next? ""There's obviously a few ideas, but we're building out where we can afford,"" Miller said. After the U.S. and Australia, the Guardian's largest foreign audience resides in Canada, and then in continental Europe and India.  ""The English-speaking spine is where the audience is,"" he said, adding that there may also be opportunities in translated coverage, something the Guardian has experimented with in the past.

Hotel offerings in Hamburg will be available in February. ""Mobile technology has revolutionized the way we plan our lives, totally shifting our mindset and approach to travel. We are no longer tied to pre-planned itineraries, but empowered to make spontaneous decisions about where to go and for how long,"" HotelTonight CEO Sam Shank said in a statement.  Last-minute booking is really where HotelTonight shines. The app offers just three hotel selections each night in each of the cities where it operates. Each selection is hand-picked by the company, and is labeled with the type of experience you're likely to have there: Luxe, Hip or Basic. Suggestions are also personalized by user. Unlike other discount hotel services, hotels with the app can be booked up to 2 a.m. local time. The app was named by Apple as one of its Best of 2012, calling it one of the most disruptive services of the year. HotelTonight is currently available in 10 countries and 80 destinations around the world. Have you ever used HotelTonight to book a last-minute hotel room?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/hulu-ad-blocking/,Ad Blocking Gets Personal: Chrome Extension Targets Hulu,"Technology that blocks or skips TV ads is becoming ever more controversial and more widely known. And with the recent launch of a Chrome extension, it got personal.  No Hulu Ads, which is free, isn't the first browser extension to black out TV commercials for your viewing pleasure. It isn't the first to offer notifications letting you know when the blacked-out commercial break is over, pausing the show automatically until you return to that tab. But it is the first to block the warning Hulu has put in place — the one that asks you to disable your ad blocker, and that strongly suggests you might not be able to see the service if you don't.  It's also the first extension we've seen to call out an online TV service by name — one that increasingly relies on ad revenue. (Hulu won't say if it intends to take any action against the developer; we've reached out to the developer for comment.) It couldn't come at a worse time for Hulu. The service is plummeting in the comScore rankings of online video services, where according to last week's comScore numbers, Hulu is now out of the top 10. It still reaches less than 8% of U.S. viewers. Still, Hulu Plus subscriptions have doubled in the last year and annual revenue is up to $700 million, according to the CEO.   Meanwhile, Hulu's ads per user was the highest in the comScore rankings. The average Hulu viewer saw 65 ads in September, versus 20 for Google platforms such as YouTube.  Hulu's increase-the-ads strategy, which began back in 2011, was meant to make it an attractive online alternative for TV networks to sell ads on.  But could it be turning viewers off just as fast — so much that they'll download extensions to block the ads? Browse the Hulu discussion boards and you'll find a healthy number of comments attacking the service's ad frequency. Meanwhile, the next frontier of ad-blocking technology lets you skip straight ahead to the next segment of the show.  You may recall CBS barred its journalists at CNET from awarding the Dish Networks' Hopper their Best in Show at CES 2013 accolade. The CNET writers hadn't been particularly excited about this set-top box, but its ability to skip ads made it the best of a bad bunch of gadgets up for the award. CBS saw red. TV ads are the network's lifeblood, and they were in the middle of suing Dish over the Hopper's ""Auto Hop"" feature. Execs ordered CNET to rescind the award. By overriding the journalists, however, they forced a high-profile resignation — and made the whole story a good deal more damaging. The Hopper is far more widely known today than it would have been had CNET simply issued the award. Dish made hay with a marketing campaign; it released ads stating it had won Best of CES anyway. The ads bore a giant asterisk.   Where is ad-blocking tech going next? Which side will the courts come down on? Give us your predictions in the comments. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/hussein-twitter-inauguration/,"'Hussein,' 'Haley,' 'Lamar' Top Twitter Inauguration Names","President Barack Obama has the middle name Hussein, one that has caused controversy because of its Arabic roots and America's uneasy relationship with Islam. During today's inauguration, Twitter lit up with a discussion of the name — the willingness of some to finally say it, and the reluctance of others, most notably the event's emcee, Sen. Chuck Schumer, to utter it. ""I am proud that my President's middle name is Hussein. I am proud of diversity and of our eclectic cultural heritage,"" wrote Twitter user Brandon Hamilton ‏bran_hamilton. ""Schumer referred twice to ""Barack H. Obama"" - doesn't want to say Hussein,"" wrote user dan ‏Danmable. (It's not clear whether it was the Senator's own decision to say ""Barack H. Obama."") Obama himself and Chief Justice John Roberts used the president's full name during the official swearing-in ceremony on Sunday and in the public ceremony today. Both times, the president began with the phrase, ""I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear…"" The president may have also touched on the issue in his address, saying ""We recall that what binds this nation together is not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names.""  SEE ALSO: Top 5 Tech Initiatives for Obama's Second Term
 Another prominent name was that of ""Roots"" author Alex Haley, whom Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander quoted when introducing Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor for the vice president's swearing in. ""The late Alex Haley, the author of Roots, lived his life by these six words: 'Find the good and praise it,'"" Alexander said. Liberal users on Twitter kept the conversation about Alexander among the top trending topics long after traffic on the ""Hussein"" topic had dwindled. ""I have never and will never vote for Lamar Alexander (R-TN), but his speech was a perfect placement of thoughts and words,"" wrote Becky Brewster Sain ‏beckysain. Ana Marie Cox ‏(anamariecox), the original ""Wonkette"" political blogger, mused that conservatives must have been reeling at Senator Alexander invoking the name of Alex Haley. In fact, the two Tennesseans, Alexander and Haley, had been long-term friends. Photo of President Obama and Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. by Pete Souza, White House

http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/james-franco-poem/,Watch James Franco Read a Strange Inauguration Poem From His Bed," Earlier this month, President Obama chose the nation's fifth inaugural poet, Richard Blanco, to recite an original poem at Monday's inauguration ceremony. Yahoo News, however, commissioned its own inaugural poems from five different writers, aiming to highlight the various ways one can write about the occasion. James Franco was among the five writers commissioned, and his poem is picking up a lot of steam on the web. Maybe it's because he rambles on and on about not knowing how to write about Obama. Maybe it's because he reveals that Obama knew him from Spider-Man. Or, most likely, because he appears to recite his poem in front of a webcam while lying in bed. SEE ALSO: How Is Google Like Poetry? Let Me Autocomplete the Ways
 Yahoo said it included Franco ""for good measure — and yes for a little glamour."" In addition to the line, """"All that stuff on CNN and [T]he Huffington Post,"" here's one of our favorite excerpts: I’m not up there, but Obama is. I was asked to write something
For the inauguration of his second term, but what could I write?
I was in Asheville, studying writing, but not the political sort;
I write confessions and characters, and that sort of thing. I wrote my friend Frank about what I could do, but he was unresponsive.
I went to class and then the little burrito place where they know me,
And finally at night I got Frank’s email on my phone and pulled over
On the side of Warren Wilson Road, past the school barn with the WWC... The general consensus on Twitter is that the poem is pretty terrible:  I've tried to avoid piling on James Franco in hopes of him making me rich somehow.

On Saturday, the 18-year-old star dropped trou and posted a picture of his bare Canadian butt to his six million followers on Instagram. The moon shot landed 100,000 likes before it was taken down and prompted a response from his manager, Scooter Braun. ""As a prankster u have to respect another good prank. only makes sense. #crackdealer,"" tweeted Braun suggesting the picture was a joke. Some are speculating that it's a publicity ploy by Bieber for his new acoustic album releasing Jan. 29, but if the full-moon photo is an attempt to shock Bieber fans, it’s way tamer than the horrific #cutforbieber campaign engineered by 4chan earlier this month. Bieber's pictures regularly rack up hundreds of thousands of likes no matter how mundane the image is, thus not making this—surprisingly—not one of his most-liked photos. A picture of Bieber and his on-and-off girlfriend Selena Gomez received 149,000 likes, but his recent uploads regularly earn three to four times that. A selfie he took last week earned 600,000 likes.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/justin-timberlake-suit-and-tie-itunes-radio/,Justin Timberlake's New Song 'Suit & Tie' Breaks Records," Singer Justin Timberlake strolled into the record books with ""Suit & Tie,"" the 'N Sync alumnus' first single since 2006.  The song, which came out Jan. 13, ranked number 14 on Billboard's Pop Songs radio airplay chart with the most debut-week plays ever in the U.S. since the chart's creation in 1992.  Billboard notes that the ranking for ""Suit & Tie"" is the highest debut rank by a solo male artist.  The first-week radio spins for ""Suit & Tie"" totaled 9,394, according to RCA Records. It had the largest first-week audience of 93.4 million people, airplay monitor Mediabase reports. Meanwhile, RCA Records also says Timberlake sold 310,078 digital singles of ""Suit & Tie"" (featuring Jay-Z), which marks his best premiere-week sales ever, for a song. It reportedly reached the top spot on iTunes' singles charts in 31 countries. Timberlake had teased a musical comeback only several days before releasing the song on iTunes on the same night as the Golden Globes.  In conjunction with the release, he put this letter on Countdown.JustinTimberlake.com: I hope this gets to you the right way. It's the only way I know to do it. Some people may criticize me for the last 3 days. But it was fun, right?? Right?!?! Besides, I'd rather speak directly to all of you. And, who can knock me for having a little bit of fun with it? Well... No more teasing. Although, it was A LOT of fun. (Did I mention that I'm having fun with this?? Ha!) *Makes a serious face* This year is an exciting one for me. As you probably have heard through the ""grapevine,"" I'm gearing up for a big 2013. Back in June of last year, I quietly started working on what is now, my next journey with that thing I love called MUSIC. The inspiration for this really came out of the blue and to be honest, I didn't expect anything out of it. I just went into the studio and started playing around with some sounds and songs. It was probably the best time I've had in my career... Just creating with no rules and/or end goal in mind and really enjoying the process. What I came up with is something I couldn't be more excited about! It is full of inspiration that I grew up listening to and some newfound muses that I've discovered along the way. I'm calling it ""The 20/20 Experience,"" and it's coming out this year. I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed making it. That's all I'm giving you for now... I know, I know!

http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/lupe-fiasco-escorted/,Lupe Fiasco Escorted Off Stage at Obama Inaugural Event,"


 Rapper Lupe Fiasco was escorted off stage during a performance at an inauguration bash on Sunday in Washington, D.C.  The event was organized by StartUp RockOn at the Hamilton Live theater. Allegedly, Fiasco — well known for his outspoken political statements — was asked to leave after he performed an anti-war song, directed in part at President Obama.  Here are a few of the lyrics: 
 ""Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist, Gaza Strip was getting bombed, Obama didn't say shit, That's why I ain't vote for him, Next one either, I'm part of the problem, My problem is I'm peaceful""
 In the video above, it appears the lights are cut out mid-performance as three security guards walk on stage to remove Fiasco. StartUp RockOn  released a statement today that assured the rapper's removal was instead the result of an unsatisfactory performance on his part:   "" ... as you may have read, he left the stage earlier than we had planned. But Lupe Fiasco was not 'kicked off stage' for an 'anti-Obama rant.' We are staunch supporters of free speech, and free political speech. This was not about his opinions. Instead, after a bizarrely repetitive, jarring performance that left the crowd vocally dissatisfied, organizers decided to move on to the next act""

 Foreign Policy reporter Josh Rogin, who apparently attended the event, tweeted that Fiasco's song went on for 30 minutes before he was asked to move to the next one.  So Lupe played one anti-war song for 30 min and said he didn't vote for Obama and eventually was told to move on to the next song. — Josh Rogin (@joshrogin) January 21, 2013 Watch the video for yourself.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/mars-crater-ancient-lake/,Giant Mars Crater May Have Once Been a Lake,"New photos of a huge crater on Mars suggest water may lurk in crevices under the planet's surface, hinting that life might have once lived there, and raising the possibility that it may live there still, researchers say. Future research looking into the chances of life on Mars could shed light on the origins of life on Earth, scientists added. The discovery came from a study of images by NASA's powerful Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter that revealed new evidence of a wet underground environment on the Red Planet. The images focused on the giant McLaughlin Crater, which is about 57 miles (92 kilometers) wide and so deep that underground water appears to have flowed into the crater at some point in the distant past.  Today, the crater is bone-dry but harbors clay minerals and other evidence that liquid water filled the area in the ancient past. ""Taken together, the observations in McLaughlin Crater provide the best evidence for carbonate forming within a lake environment instead of being washed into a crater from outside,"" study lead author Joseph Michalski, of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Ariz., and London's Natural History Museum, said in a statement.  SEE ALSO: Search for Water on Mars (Photos)
 Space agencies have deployed many missions to Mars over the decades to explore how habitable its surface may have been or is today. However, the Martian surface has been extremely cold, arid and chemically hostile to life as we know it for most of the history of Mars. Instead of scanning the surface of Mars for life, scientists have suggested the most viable habitat for ancient simple life may have been in Martian water hidden underground. On Earth, microbes up to 3 miles (5 km) or more underground make up perhaps half of all of the planet's living matter. Most of these organisms represent some of the most primitive kinds of microbes known, hinting that life may actually have started underground, or at least survived there during a series of devastating cosmic impacts known as the Late Heavy Bombardment that Earth and the rest of the inner solar system endured about 4.1 billion to 3.8 billion years ago. Since Mars has less gravity — a surface gravity of a little more than one-third Earth's — its crust is less dense and more porous than that of our planet, which means that more water can leak underground, researchers said. Wherever there is liquid water on Earth, there is virtually always life, and microbes underground on Mars could be sustained by energy sources and chemical reactions similar to those that support deep-dwelling organisms on Earth. ""The deep crust has always been the most habitable place on Mars, and would be a wise place to search for evidence for organic processes in the future,"" Michalski told SPACE.com.  SEE ALSO: Search for Life on Mars: A Timeline
 While researchers currently have no way to drill deep underground on the Red Planet, they can nevertheless spot hints of what subterranean Mars is like by analyzing deep rocks exhumed by erosion, asteroid impacts or materials generated by underground fluids that have welled up to the surface. Such upwelling would first occur in deep basins like McLaughlin Crater — as the lowest points on the surface, they would be where underground water reserves would most likely get exposed. Scientists focused on McLaughlin Crater because it is one of the deepest craters on Mars. McLaughlin is about 1.3 miles (2.2 km) deep and is located in Mars' northern hemisphere. The mineral composition of the floor of McLaughlin Crater suggests there was a lake made of upwelled groundwater there. Channels seen on the crater's eastern wall about 1,650 feet (500 meters) above its floor also hint at the former presence of a lake surface. Michalski was actually originally trying to disprove the idea that groundwater breached the surface in many locations on Mars. ""Lo and behold, there was strong evidence for that process in this crater,"" he said. ""Science is special because we are allowed to change our minds."" The researchers estimate that a lake existed at McLaughlin Crater for an unknown duration between 3.7 billion and 4 billion years ago. ""That makes the deposits as old as or older than the oldest rocks known to exist on Earth,"" Michalski said. Mounds seen on the crater floor may have come from landslides or subsequent meteor impacts. These are important because they may have rapidly buried crater floor sediments. ""That is really cool because rapid burial is the scenario that is most advantageous for preservation of organic material, if any was present at that time,"" Michalski said. Since life on Earth may have begun underground, learning more about any underground life that might have lived — or may still live — on Mars could shed light on the origins of life on Earth, researchers said. ""We should give serious consideration to exploring rocks representing subsurface environments in future missions,"" Michalski said. ""That doesn't mean drilling, but instead exploring rocks formed from upwelling groundwater, or rocks naturally exhumed from the subsurface by meteor impact."" Michalski noted that some people may ask, ""'Why do I hear about the detection of water or possibility of life on Mars all the time?' The answer is because Mars is habitable in more ways than we ever realized for many years, and we are finding water in many forms and environments on Mars — many more than we predicted for a long time."" The ingredients for life the researchers describe, ""including energy sources, would have been more available early in Mars' history, but it doesn't take too much imagination to picture a scenario in which the subsurface is habitable today,"" Michalski said. He cautioned, however, ""that is much different from saying that life is there today."" The scientists detailed their findings online Jan. 20 in the journal Nature Geoscience.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/music-group-says-myspace-is-using-songs-without-permission/,Music Group Says Myspace Is Using Songs Without Permission,"The new Myspace is now open to all, shifting the aging social network's focus toward building connections between musicians and fans. With an updated design and the star power of Justin Timberlake (one of the company's backers), the site has garnered a lot of attention. Now it has its first official complaint. Merlin, an U.K.-based agency that represents many independent record labels, says Myspace is using the music of its artists without permission. The group used to have a deal with the old MySpace and its MySpace Music service, but the agreement expired over a year ago. ""What we've taken issue with is the service launched without a license from us, yet with our music all over the service,"" Merlin CEO Charles Caldas told Mashable. ""It's launching with hundreds of tracks and offering them free, on demand to consumers without the permission of the people who own the material, and certainly without remunerating them for it."" Searching for Arcade Fire and Vampire Weekend — two artists on music labels that are part of the Merlin Group — on MySpace turns up multiple tracks. A spokesperson for Myspace told The New York Times that if any music from the Merlin group is on Myspace that it was ""likely"" uploaded by individual users. The rep also said Myspace would remove any songs if Merlin requested it. That explanation doesn't sit well with Caldas, who said Merlin is preparing a legal response. ""I don't see ignorance as a justification for piracy,"" he says. ""If you're offering music, without permission, that belongs to a copyright holder in a commercial environment, the onus is on you, the business, to make sure those rights are cleared."" SEE ALSO: The New Myspace: Music Meets Social, Done Right
 Music is the primary focus of the new Myspace, with an emphasis on mainstream artists. The service has a built-in music player and users — whether fans or musicians — can easily share songs, albums and playlists with followers. Users can also associate songs with their profiles, although unlike Classic MySpace, the songs don't auto-play.  The new Myspace launched last fall in limited beta and last week shifted to an open beta, timed to coincide with the release of Timberlake's latest single, ""Suit & Tie."" The service has not yet had an official launch. Do you think Myspace should renew its deals with Merlin and other independent artists? And should it more aggressively police potential copyright violations? Share your reactions in the comments. Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images News/Getty Images Myspace is all-new, and it's all about making music social. The new site is backed by Justin Timberlake and incorporates many elements of modern web design, particularly an emphasis on visual media. Although the site excels at discovery, its iconography is sometimes perplexing. Myspace's design is based on a horizontal scroll, which incorporates a news feed of your updates and those of other users and artists you're following. Cover photos must be high quality, and your playback queue (seen on the bottom) is always present. If you mouse over the queue, as in this screenshot, album covers appear. Setting up your profile thankfully doesn't take long, and you can use your Twitter or Facebook accounts to log in. You can also log into the new site with your ""MySpace Classic"" info. Myspace asks a little about your background and interests, which determines the areas on the site where like-minded users can find you. The new Myspace keeps privacy settings simple, at least for now. Finding artists and songs to connect with is easy once you figure it out. The site encourages you to create and share playlists, called Mixes. You can make them private, too. Just start typing anywhere, anytime on the site to begin a search -- very convenient. Not sure where to start on Myspace? Browsing people in your area or who share your interests is as good a place as any. You can browse the users and artists you've connected with very easily. The site's layout is clean throughout. The Trending page has many articles on various entertainment topics, but would probably be better served by an aggregator. Here's what an article looks like -- very similar to the news apps in Windows 8. Myspace puts the focus on what you're sharing in any moment, pushing the rest of the site to the background. The icons that represent the nature of your connection with people are a little confusing at first, though the ""affinity"" you have with someone else is arguably more helpful. Videos take up you're whole browser window, but if you navigate away they get reduced to a smaller pop-up window, with no interruption in playback. Myspace's clever 404 page, which includes a Mix. "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/obama-gay-rights-inauguration/,Obama's Gay Rights Inauguration Mention Makes History," Barack Obama made history Monday, when he became the first president to mention gay rights in an inaugural address.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/obama-inauguration-nasa/,"With Obama Inauguration, NASA's Deep-Space Mission Continues","With President Barack Obama taking the oath of office to begin his second term today, it kicks off four more years for NASA to pursue its audacious goal of sending astronauts farther into deep space than ever before. Two major pieces of NASA's deep-space exploration program — full-size replicas of the agency's new Orion space capsule and Mars rover Curiosity — made an appearance during Obama's inaugural parade on Jan. 21. NASA's ""Mohawk Guy"" Bobak Ferdowsi, a Curiosity flight director renowned for his hairstyle, also marched in the parade, sporting a new hairdo to mark the event. Several NASA astronauts, including Michael Massimino — the agency's most followed space man on Twitter (@Astro_Mike) — appeared in the parade, too. In his first term as president, Obama canceled NASA's moon-oriented Constellation program and directed the space agency to pursue a new vision of deep-space exploration, a program that aims to send the first manned mission to an asteroid by 2025. By the mid-2030s, the target is Mars.  Obama unveiled the space exploration vision in April 2010 at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla. A year later, NASA's space shuttle program — already winding down by the time Obama first took office — flew its final missions. In 2012, the iconic winged space planes were delivered to museums across the country.  SEE ALSO: NASA Photos: Obama's 2nd Inauguration
 At the same time, NASA was busy developing a new spacecraft for deep-space exploration, the Orion space capsule, as well as a giant rocket called the Space Launch System to boost the capsule off the planet. The agency is developing another craft, the Space Exploration Vehicle, designed to make the trip to a near-Earth asteroid or other deep-space destination. Here's a look at NASA's human spaceflight projects that will be under way during Obama's second term. Construction has already begun on NASA's first Orion space capsule to fly and will continue throughout this year. That prototype is expected to launch unmanned atop an existing Delta 4 Heavy rocket in 2014 for an initial test.  A more ambitious unmanned test flight around the moon is planned for 2017, when an Orion capsule will make an unmanned trip around the moon after launching on the first Space Launch System booster. The first operational flights of the complete Orion and Space Launch System designs are expected by 2021. By that time, Obama's second term will have been over for several years.  SEE ALSO: Curiosity Rover Rolls In Inauguration Parade
 Last week, NASA finalized a deal with the European Space Agency on the Orion capsule's service module, which will provide power, propulsion and other vital systems for the space capsule beginning with the 2017 test flight. The move, NASA officials said, sets the stage for a true international approach to space exploration beyond low-Earth orbit. ""Space has long been a frontier for international cooperation as we explore,"" Dan Dumbacher, NASA's deputy associate administrator for Exploration System Development, said in a Jan. 16 statement. ""This latest chapter builds on NASA's excellent relationship with ESA as a partner in the International Space Station, and helps us move forward in our plans to send humans farther into space than we’ve ever been before."" In addition to exploring a near-Earth asteroid and Mars, NASA is also eyeing a potential plan to build a deep-space station on the far side of the moon that could serve as a stepping stone to the asteroid or Mars flights. While NASA works on new spacecraft for deep-space missions, the agency is also supporting the development of new private manned spaceflight vehicles that could ferry American astronauts into and from low-Earth orbit. NASA hopes the commercial spacecraft will be ready by 2017. Until then, the space agency is dependent on Russia's Soyuz spacecraft for flying Americans into orbit. NASA already has billion-dollar deals with two private companies, SpaceX of Hawthorne, Calif., and Orbital Sciences Corp., in Virginia, to provide commercial cargo deliveries to the International Space Station aboard robotic spacecraft. Last year, SpaceX flew two missions to the space station using its Falcon 9 rockets and Dragon spacecraft, and plans to launch its third flight sometime in March under a $1.6 billion contract for 12 missions. Orbital Sciences is planning to launch the first test flights of its Antares rocket and Cygnus space capsule later this year as part of a $1.9 billion contract for eight missions. In December, NASA awarded a total of $30 million in funding to three different private spaceflight companies to support their work on new commercial spaceships. SpaceX, aerospace veteran Boeing and Sierra Nevada Corp. received different amounts of the funding package to spur their individual projects. SpaceX is working to scale up its Dragon capsule to carry seven astronauts on roundtrip orbital flights. Boeing, too, is working on a space capsule (called Commercial Space Transportation 100), while Sierra Nevada is developing a small space plane dubbed Dream Chaser for its entry. A fourth contender, the company Blue Origin founded by billionaire Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, is also competing for NASA funding. NASA provided an update on the four companies' projects last week, with each firm promising big steps forward for their space vehicles in 2013. ""I think the partnership between NASA and each of these companies clearly shows that we have a very vibrant space industry in the United States,"" said Ed Mango, NASA's manager for the commercial crew program. ""The four companies here today are capable and are the leading edge of what it takes to get folks back into low-Earth orbit over time."" Official White House Photo by Pete Souza

 A panel of successful young entrepreneurs shares the strategies that are actually working. Here's what they had to say.
  Coupon codes are essential to an ecommerce startup if it is in a competitive market. Business owners can use coupons wisely in their marketing strategies by retargeting with banners or shopping cart abandonment emails to lure shoppers back to a website. Nevertheless, if you want to build a sustainable business, never make discounted product your only value proposition. - Pablo Palatnik, ShadesDaddy.com
 Here's how we've used coupons and special discounts with great results in our business: We provide partners with special discount offers they can distribute to their audiences. We set a time-based deadline or quantity-based limit. And we provide partners with commissions on sales, so they have an extra incentive to promote the offers. - Pete Kennedy, Main Street ROI
 Coupon codes are an excellent way to track and measure your advertising ROI. Simply use a different code for each ad outlet (i.e. Google vs. Bing vs. Facebook) so you can see exactly how many sales each campaign generated. With a little bit of tech work, you can also use coupon codes to track — down to the keyword level of your search ad campaigns — which is critical for optimization. - Phil Frost, Main Street ROI
 On your Facebook fan page, you can offer coupons and discounts to your fans right through Facebook, or you can choose to use third-party apps. Instead of just offering a coupon to everyone, I think it's neat to reward your most loyal fans, as one company called Earthegy does. The gemstone jewelry company offers discounts and promotions, but only to their top fans, which it determines through an app. - Natalie MacNeil, She Takes on the World
 Discount codes are great for tracking which sales channels are performing the best for you. For our Entrepreneurs Unpluggd events, we give our marketing partners unique discount codes to distribute, so we can see which channels refer the most sales and concentrate on optimizing those channels. - Tim Jahn, matchist
 Use online discount or coupon codes to offer discounts to the first buyers. This creates scarcity, so more people take action quickly and move forward with their purchase decisions. A scarcity component drives the people who may be on the fence to take the leap. - DC Fawcett, Paramount Digital Publishing
 Many businesses make the mistake of simply using coupons to increase conversions. The bigger opportunity is to utilize them to also learn more about your customers' behavior along the way. Create unique codes to be used through a variety of channels, create custom codes for partners and then test different discount formats to maximize conversions based on real data. - Anderson Schoenrock, ScanDigital
 The problem with coupon codes is that you've jumped into the game of competing on price. That might not be a good strategy for service providers or those businesses with a unique product that is only distributed on their sites. However, coupon codes can be very smart for retailers that compete with other sites to sell the same items. An extra 10% off can make a customer choose your site over the competition. - Laura Roeder, LKR
 Consumers today are programmed to find a deal, so discount coupon codes are a must-have for any online business. Our best coupon conversions come from a prominent tab labeled ""coupon"" on the left side of our homepage. When clicked, our email club sign-up form pops up. Customers can then submit their info. Shortly thereafter, they receive a discount coupon code via email. - Anthony Saladino, Kitchen Cabinet Kings
 Late last year, we had pro athletes retweet a coupon code to their followers. Cumulatively, our discount went out to 2 million Twitter users. But our conversions from that campaign were less than our current strategy, which is to give a discount to anyone who asks. We encourage people to ask us for a code in our social media bios. Our conversions are higher when people ask, rather than us doing the asking. - Brett Farmiloe, Markitors
 Give your employees a handful of discount codes in varying increments, and let them surprise customers with them. You can teach them to say: ""We appreciate your business so much! You know — I'd like to give you $50 off your next order. Thanks for being such a great customer!"" Acts of kindness like this go a long way toward building brand loyalty. - Robert Sofia, Platinum Advisor Marketing Strategies, LLC
 Never offer discount or coupon codes unless you understand the unit economics of your business. I've seen friends get buried by deal sites — not because deal sites are bad, but because the business itself did not understand its own unit economics. Before you offer any sort of discount, know your customer lifetime value (CLV), and whether offering a discount will pay off in the long run. - Sunil Rajaraman, Scripted.com
 Want to encourage affiliates to market for you? Give them a coupon code they can give to their audience. When the coupon codes are redeemed, track the affiliate's sales. In the end, users get discounts, your affiliates get commission and you get new customers. - Sean Ogle, Location 180, LLC  Thumbnail photo courtesy of Flickr, jridgewayphotography BONUS: YouTube's 20 Most-Viewed Ads of 2012 The second-biggest sporting event of the year, next to the Olympics, was soccer's Euro 2012 -- which explains why this ad was the most-viewed. The commercial is filled with soccer stars such as Ronaldo, Iniesta, Ribery and Neymar, who are challenged by a group of unknown players who invade a stadium in the middle of a game between France and the Netherlands. In this hilarious ad, Kyrie Irving joins a pick-up basketball game in New Jersey, pretending to be ""Uncle Drew."" At first, it looks like a middle-aged man struggling to keep up with younger players -- but then comes the surprise.  How would Star Wars's ""Imperial March"" sound if a group of dogs barked it? This video has the answer.  With this clever commercial, Samsung continues its series of innovative and sarcastic ads making fun of the iPhone 5.  Honda revives classic coming-of-age movie, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, with this funny ad featuring none other than Matthew Broderick himself, who skips a day of acting to take a ride in his CR-V. This Volkswagen ad features both Darth Vader and a dog that wants to get back in shape -- an unlikely combo that delivers a hilarious ad.  GoPro launched its new camera, the Hero3, with this breathtaking commercial that opens with stunning views of mountains, beaches and cities. It then showcases spectacular footage taken by skiers, surfers and kayakers. Before Clint Eastwood was ridiculed for his Republican National Convention appearance alongside a chair, he was featured in this Chrysler ad that praises Detroit's recovery after the economic crisis. Ironically, Republicans thought the ad was pro-Obama.  It's hard for an ad to go wrong when it features two of the biggest sports stars in the world. Here, tennis ace Rafa Nadal and soccer's second-best player Cristiano Ronaldo battle in an unlikely tennis match in which one of them doesn't even use a racket.  In this Super Bowl commercial, a Vampire gets to a party with his new Audi. The party comes to a screeching -- err, make that burning -- halt thanks to the car's new, bright LED headlights.  The Chevy Silverado can take you to the end of the world: That's the message of this apocalyptic-parody commercial that also takes a jab at Chevrolet's main competitor.  Snoop Lion endorses Microwaveables with this music video.  Men's deodorant Old Spice didn't rank in the top 10, but its short and funny ad is just the first of four more that made it into the top 20.  Old Spice and Terry Crews make another appearance here, hijacking sister brand Procter & Gamble's commercial.  In this somewhat odd ad, a fireman ""comes to the rescue"" to prepare a margarita for a ladies' night out. Oh, it features a cute kitty too.  Toyota reinvented the Camry, so why stop there and not reinvent other things, such as blinds made of pizza or time-traveling babies? For this Hot Wheels commercial, stunt-man Brent Fletcher breaks the record for longest corkscrew jump with a 92-foot leap. In this commercial, Charlie Sheen seems to enjoy being under house arrest. Old Spice strikes again, this time with Packers wide receiver Greg Jennings. Old Spice ends the list with another commercial, featuring Terry Crews.  "

The change comes days before the planned launch of RIM's new mobile platform, BlackBerry 10. The new name reflects the new kinds of content RIM will make available to the store, which will be available under ""Videos"" and ""Music"" sections, though at the time of this writing those types of content still aren't available for purchase. RIM claims the new store will be a ""one-stop shop for all of your entertainment needs.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/rim-license-blackberry10/,RIM May License BlackBerry 10 to Other Manufacturers,"Research in Motion could end up applying the Windows model of licensing its mobile operating system to other hardware manufacturers after BlackBerry 10 gets off the ground, the company's CEO told a German newspaper. RIM may also get out of the hardware business altogether at some point. The German national newspaper Die Welt published a lengthy Q&A with RIM CEO Thorsten Heins, in which the leader of the beleaguered Canadian company said he was keeping all options on the table to steer the company toward success. When asked directly about licensing BlackBerry 10, Heins said it was ""conceivable"" if the platform showed the world it has ""large potential."" RIM is scheduled to launch BlackBerry 10 at the end of January. The new OS represents a generational shift in BlackBerry software and devices, finally giving the company a credible response to the smartphones running iOS and Android. RIM will only offer touch-screen devices initially, and BB10 handsets sporting QWERTY keyboards will follow in the ensuing weeks or months. SEE ALSO: RIM Loses BlackBerry Subscribers But Grows Cash Pile
 Heins went on to tell the paper that his broad strategic review of the company is ongoing. He then suggested RIM may sell off its hardware production business without even being directly asked. However, he cautioned that any big strategy decisions would have to wait until the market's initial response to BlackBerry 10 becomes clear. It's anyone's guess how popular BB10 devices will be, but RIM has built some differentiating features into the new devices. There's an onscreen keyboard that predicts what you're typing in an innovative way as well as a BlackBerry Hub that lets you access often-used functions like contacts and calendars without switching between apps. Heins also describes BB10 phones as having completely separated environments for work an personal use, with different encryption. There can be ""no exchange"" between the two areas, he says. How are you feeling about BlackBerry 10 and RIM's chances to rekindle its success? Let us know in the comments. Photo by Pete Pachal, Mashable You unlock a BlackBerry 10 device by swiping up from the bottom of the screen. When you swipe up, the lock screen dissolves into the home screen on the device. Swiping to the side brings up additional pages of apps. You can also navigate through pages of apps by tapping on the scroll bar on the bottom of the screen. Taking a page from Windows Phone, RIM is adding “Active Frames” to BB10. Much like the ""Live Tiles” found in Windows Phone, the frames update with information you can see at a glance. For instance, the weather app will show the current temperature as well as a 7-day forecast, the calendar app shows your next event for the day. BlackBerry Hub can be accessed by swiping across the screen. Contact cards include phone numbers, email addresses and social-networking details. RIM is taking the look and feel of its home screen and bringing it into groups. Active frames make an appearance in groups, allowing you to see chats pertaining to a particular group, people who are a part of the group, and photos that have been uploaded. Pictures change as they are uploaded to the group, so if someone uploads a new one then that image will change on the group's page. Tapping on a person in a group will bring up his or her contact card. Taking photos in BlackBerry 10 starts out much like taking photos with any other OS, with the ability to tap on any portion of the photo to focus on a specific portion of the frame. If a photo you take is blurry, or someone in the picture has his or her eyes closed, you can use the scroll bar on the bottom of the screen to move forward and backward in time to capture the perfect shot. Much like you can adjust a whole picture, you can also pic out individual faces in a photo to adjust. So, if one friend has her eyes closed in a picture, you can just adjust herface in the photo. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/rumor-apple-to-launch-an-iphone-with-a-4-8-inch-screen-in-2013/,Rumor: Apple to Launch an iPhone With a 4.8-Inch Screen in 2013,"Apple will launch not one, not two, but three new iPhones in 2013, one of which will have a 4.8-inch screen, a new rumor claims.  According to the China Times, which cites sources from Apple's supply chain, Apple will launch a next-generation ""classic"" iPhone and a 4.8-inch device, halfway between a smartphone and a tablet, codenamed ""iPhone Math"". Furthermore, the rumor claims Apple will also launch a third iPhone model with a 12-megapixel camera towards the end of the year.  Very little is known about either of these, except for the camera on the 4.8-inch device, which should be of the 8-megapixel variety, with Largan Precision building the lenses.  The report should be taken with a large chunk of salt. Apple's 7.9-inch iPad mini and the 4-inch iPhone 5 have shown the company is willing to explore different form factors, which sparked the iPhone-tablet hybrid rumors. There has been no official word or indication that such a device is indeed being built, though it could arguably help Apple deal with competing large-screen Android smartphones which are selling extremely well, most notably the 4.8-inch Samsung Galaxy S III.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/samsung-blackberry-ad/,Samsung Goes After BlackBerry in New Ad," It looks like Samsung is turning its ad machine against a new competitor: RIM.  In a new ad that aired during the NFC Championship game Sunday night, Samsung promoted its Galaxy Note II smartphone as ""the next big thing for business"" and made fun of BlackBerry phones in the process.  The ad shows an office team working on developing a game called Unicorn Apocalypse on a tight deadline. At the same time, the team is told they can finally use any smartphone they want at work. That's when the real battle starts. Most in the office switch to using Samsung's phablet, but a handful of holdouts have trouble ditching the BlackBerry device they've always used at work, worried about whether Samsung's phones are as secure or useful. SEE ALSO: Samsung Galaxy Note II: A Giant Phone That Grows on You [REVIEW]
 Samsung uses the ad to debunk these concerns while poking fun at the BlackBerry users. One woman in the office says she has always relied on a ""system"" of using a BlackBerry at work and another smartphone at home. When another employee suggests she can just use a single Samsung phone instead, the woman says sternly, ""Respect my system."" In recent months, Samsung has mainly targeted Apple with its print and TV ads. Perhaps RIM should take this as a compliment. After months of being written off by many, RIM is finally set to unveil its BlackBerry 10 products later this month. Given the timing of the ad, it appears that Samsung, a market leader, views this as enough of a potential threat to merit advertising against.  Congratulations, RIM: Samsung thinks you're a competitor again. Homepage image courtesy of YouTube "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/samsung-galaxy-note-8-confirmed/,Report: Samsung Exec Confirms Galaxy Note 8,"A Samsung executive confirmed to a group of reporters that the company will unveil a smaller version of its Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet at a trade show next month, a Korean news site reports. The new tablet will be Samsung's direct competitor to the iPad mini. Jong-Kyun Shin, the president of Samsung's mobile business (pictured), told reporters attending a dinner in Seoul, Korea, that the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 would be fully revealed at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, at the end of February, according to iNews24 and reported by Engadget. As the name implies, it'll be an 8-inch tablet, very close in size to the iPad mini (which sports a 7.9-inch screen) as opposed to the 7-inch size of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0. Other features and specs of the device remain a mystery, but it'll certainly include the Note line's trademark stylus. Once the subject of ridicule, the Note stylus has become a key differentiator for Samsung, with many novel abilities such as translate handwriting to text and previewing emails by hovering over the subject line in the inbox. SEE ALSO: Sh*t People Say About the Samsung Galaxy Note [VIDEO]
 Currently Samsung's Note products include the 10.1-inch Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet and 5.6-inch Galaxy Note II smartphone. Samsung just updated the Note 10.1 to Jelly Bean, though it missed its own deadline to do so before the end of 2012. The Note II already runs Jelly Bean, and the original Note (a.k.a. the Note I) was promised an as-yet-unreleased update to Jelly Bean as well. And what about the rumored Samsung Galaxy S IV smartphone? For now, that product remains unconfirmed, and Shin even implied it would not make an appearance at MWC. That's not a surprise, since Samsung tends to launch its flagship Galaxy phones at standalone events. Last year, the company unveiled the Galaxy S III in early May. What's your take on the smaller-screen Note tablet? Does an 8-inch screen sound more attractive than the other options? Let us know your thoughts in the comments. Photo via Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images Samsung's latest tablet brings has a big differentiator from the iPad: a stylus. And it's a stylus that's actually useful for certain tasks, like writing notes, creating equations and sketching. It starts at $499 (for 16GB). The home screen has Samsung's usual junk (Music and Media Hubs, mainly), but they're easily deleted. The screen measures 10.1 inches diagonal and has 1,280 x 800 resolution. The sides of the Note 10.1 have no connectors The top, however, has the headphone jack, a microSD slot, an infrared emitter for remote-control abilities (assisted with an app called Peel) and the volume and power buttons. Just as spartan as the right side. Samsung puts a proprietary charging and data connector on the bottom. Here's where the stylus (Samsung calls it the S Pen) resides. That label is removable. The back of the Note is plastic, keeping the tablet relatively lightweight at 1.3 pounds. The S Note app is where you'll probably use the stylus the most. It has some well-thought-out features, like ""palm rejection,"" which lets you rest your hand on the screen without mucking up your notes. The stylus is pressure-sensitive, meaning your markings will thicken as you press harder. Here's the S Pen up close. Like its predecessor on the Galaxy Note smartphone, it has a button for advanced functions (like doing a screen capture), but unlike the previous version it has a square design so it doesn't roll. The stand the Note is resting is sold separately. With handwriting recognition enabled in the S Note app, the tablet will take your writing... ...and turn it into actual text. It works in ""real time"" (pause and the translation just happens), and it's about 65-70% accurate, though your mileage will vary greatly depending on your handwriting skills. S Note also translates equations. This tends to be much more accurate than handwriting recognition. You can have two apps actively running side by side on the new Galaxy Note 10.1, although it only works with a few apps right now. With the video player, you can take multitasking to a new level with a pop-up window. You can resize the pop-up by pinching. Pop-Up Play also works on the home screen. "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/speed-up-your-pc/,5 Easy Ways to Speed Up Your PC,"When your PC starts its steady decline into sloth-like speeds, the first thing you’d love to do (besides beating it Office Space-style) is head straight to the mall for a fancy new machine. But the reality is there are easy changes you can make to speed up your computer.  SEE ALSO: 10 Gchat Tricks and Tips for Power Users
 From startup to surfing to gaming, here are five ways you can clean up an old PC to make it look young again. If an entire pot of coffee can brew in the time it takes for your computer to boot, it’s time to make some changes. Most likely your computer is not slow – it’s the dozens of programs turning on during startup that are slowing it down. Download a comprehensive tool like Autoruns to easily disable certain programs during your startup. Or try Windows’ slightly less thorough, built-in utility, MSConfig. To find it, go to Search or Run under Start and type “msconfig.” Under the “Startup” tab, uncheck the boxes of the programs you don’t need to run every time your computer is turned on, for instance, iTunes or your printer. If you don’t recognize a program, leave it be. Restart your computer and watch it fly. If painfully slow surfing is your main problem, there are a couple quick changes you can make.  Are you an Internet Explorer user? Get rid of it. Google Chrome is the best browser on the market now, known for speedy surfing. Under Chrome, go to Clear Browsing Data and check the boxes of temporary Internet files like cookies, cache, download history and browsing history.  To take further precaution, try a program like CCleaner from Piriform. The free software program removes temporary files from all of your browsers, as well as Windows and the registry, to make your PC run faster. This involves more than just uninstalling programs you don’t use anymore. If you’re not totally committed to the usual suspects, like Windows Media Player and Microsoft Office, switch to something that requires less computing power. Free applications can easily replace go-to programs, while speeding up your PC and giving you additional features at the same time. VLC Media Player is a lightweight, open source media player that rips DVDs, streams video and recognizes any unprotected media format. FoxIt Reader, an alternative to Adobe Reader, does more than just open PDFs all while using less RAM. Edit documents, open multiple PDFs in tabs and more. AbiWord, a free and open source word processor, and Apache’s Open Office, a free and open source full-fledge suite, can easily fill the void of Microsoft Office. Updates are annoying. It’s easy to click “remind me later” and avoid the notifications, until you’re so frustrated with your computer that you finally set aside an entire afternoon to update everything.  Let’s solve this. Go to My Computer > Properties > Automatic Updates. Make sure this is set to Download and Install Automatically. To completely cover your bases, find out if any programs need to be updated manually by downloading Update Checker from FileHippo.com. The fast and free program scans your computer and reports back with any available updates in seconds. If you’re into gaming, a $150 investment in a graphics card might be worth your while. Forewarning: You’ll have to toy with your motherboard to make this upgrade happen, but there are a lot of online tutorials you can follow.  Finally, the most effective way to speed up your PC – which also requires tinkering – is to add more RAM (random access memory). You can find 4GB of memory for under $50 online. If you have less than 2GB (go to My Computer > Properties to find out), an upgrade should be in your future.  Image courtesy of iStockphoto, pick-uppath "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/storify-private-facebook-updates/,Storify Loophole Publishes Private Facebook Updates,"Your private Facebook statuses aren't as private as you thought — when it comes to Storify. A vulnerability in the popular online content-curation platform allows individuals to pull and publish statuses from any Facebook account or group regardless of privacy setting. The first to notice this was Julie Pippet, a communications and public relations professional who stumbled into the privacy breach by accident. Using the Storify extension for the Google Chrome browser, which helpfully adds a Storify button to Facebook and other social Web pages, Pippet was able to add a friend's Facebook status about Superstorm Sandy into her public Storify feed. ""I felt so terrible about what happened that I started digging and checking,"" Pippert told AGBeat, ""and I figured out that although anything can be copied, screen-captured, or otherwise shared, anyone who installs the Storify app can do it with one click, even if it is marked or otherwise set to be private."" The Daily Dot confirmed Pippet's assertion by taking a comment left in a private Facebook group and Storifying it using the Chrome extension. But when we tried to do the same using the Storify web page, it didn't work. And when we tried to Storify a private tweet, that failed too. As far as we can tell, the privacy loophole only works with Facebook statuses and only works with the Chrome extension. A Facebook representative was unavailable for comment as of this story's publication. Even if this was intentional on Storify's part, it should give Facebook users a reason to take time to truly understand their privacy settings on the social network. These can be confusing at times, as evidenced by a recent incident where Randi Zuckerberg, sister of the site's founder, had a ""private"" picture go viral on Twitter.

Craig Wall argued that the new smart search is not revolutionary, but is definitely a much-needed improvement. Tyler Mendoza commented on the potential effects the smarter Facebook search could have on social startups. Travis Wright applauded the smarter search after his own hands-on experience. Seth Fiegerman reported on the harsh words Google CEO Larry Page's had for  Dean Rodgers was not impressed by the response letter. Heather Swinney was quick to defend the term ""geek,"" arguing that not every light-saber wielding person met the high standards this term warranted.

Marcus Little had some great, insightful feedback regarding the musical style of the new Destiny's Child song. Mashable reporter Christina Warren's personal response to the death of Aaron Swartz and the need to talk about depression in the tech world received tons of positive feedback as users voiced their own experiences. Reader Doriano Carta thanked Christina for writing about the ""human side"" of Swartz's struggle. Heidi Oran shared her own struggles with the topic, saying that more must do so as well.  Last week was full of major announcements: Facebook unveiled its new Graph Search, Google's CEO, Larry Page, shared his opinion of Facebook's products, and (perhaps most importantly) Destiny's Child debuted a new song, ""Nuclear.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/21/total-boox/,"E-bookstore Lets You Read First, Pay Later","The Launchpad is a series that introduces Mashable readers to compelling startups. If you would like to have your startup considered for inclusion, please see the details here. Name: Total Boox One-Liner Pitch: An e-bookstore and e-reading platform that lets you pay only for what you read. Why It's Taking Off: Total Boox lets you sample e-books, and take in single pages or chapters, without forking over the full purchase price. In the days when books were only available in wearable and tearable bound editions, it made sense for buyers to pay money upfront. But with the advent of e-books, that model may no longer be desirable or even necessary, contends Israel-based entrepreneur Yoav Lorch. Lorch, who is also a published author, is the founder and CEO of Total Boox, a web and app-based system in early beta that lets you ""read first, pay later.""   Sign up for Total Boox through its app for Android tablets and you'll receive $2 in book-buying credit. (An iPad app is scheduled to hit the App Store in mid-February.) You can then download any e-book in the catalog. You can also browse other readers' book ""playlists"" and download them with a single tap, and create your own. Selection is limited to 10,000 e-books at present, as only a handful of small publishers, including F+W Media and Chicago-based Sourcebooks, have signed on to the platform. Lorch says he is currently in discussions with Penguin about bringing its titles to Total Boox — a deal that could bring both quality content and other big publishers to the system.  After downloading an e-book, you're welcome to flip through it from beginning to end for free. Only if you stay on a single page for more than six seconds — the minimum amount of time Lorch argues you would need to ""read"" a significant part of a page — will you be charged, and then only for what fraction of a book you read. So if you read 10 pages of a 100-page book that costs $10, you'll only pay $1. Those pages don't need to be consecutive either; you could read the first chapter and the last chapter, and won't be charged for any of the content in the middle. After you've exhausted your $2 credit, you can purchase additional credits starting at $10 using a credit card or PayPal, just as you would with Skype or the Paperless Post. The advantages for consumers are clear: Just as you might in a physical bookstore, you can download and explore a wide variety of books without committing to purchase. It's a less restrictive system for e-book discovery than Amazon's, which will often only let readers sample the first chapter of a book. The opportunities for the education market are perhaps even greater, when you think of all the students and researchers who may only require access to a single article or chapter of a book. It's easy to imagine a system — perhaps subsidized by university libraries — where they could pay for just the portion they need.  Some publishers may dislike the notion of receiving only partial payments for the books they distribute, but Lorch thinks it will encourage people to explore more and read more, confident in the belief that what they do pay for they will enjoy. ""Buying first creates a barrier,"" Lorch said in a sit-down interview with Mashable last week. ""[With Total Boox], readers may be paying smaller amounts, but there will be more of them."" Lorch also thinks there are interesting data possibilities. Total Boox could build a recommendation engine based not on what e-books you've purchased, but the ones you've actually read. Authors and publishers could see what sections are the most and least read, allowing them to expand or nix a chapter in a future edition. With limited publisher sign on, Total Boox is, at present, more interesting as a concept than as an experience. But after having tested its iPad and Android apps, both of which are pleasingly designed and easy to navigate, I can say that the experience is very promising. The real threat is the more established players in the space, like Amazon and Barnes & Noble-backed Nook, which, should Total Boox's model prove successful, could rather easily copy it themselves.

Screenshots of the posts were taken by a reader and sent to sports blog The Big Lead. ""Proud of my husband and the Pats,"" Wrote Anna Burns Welker (pictured above in 2005 as she was crowned Miss Hooters International). ""By the way, if anyone is bored, please go to Ray Lewis' Wikipedia page. 6 kids 4 wives. Acquitted for murder. Paid a family off. Yay. What a hall of fame player! A true role model!"" Lewis will retire after the Super Bowl, ending a legendary 17-year-career. He is a controversial figure, however, for his role in a fight following Super Bowl XXIV in 2000. Two men were stabbed to death but murder charges against Lewis were dropped after he agreed to testify against two friends who were later acquitted of murder. Lewis was sentenced to 12 months probation, while the NFL fined him $250,000. His reputation as an extremely hard worker and fearless, peerless leader and pep-talker, however, has rehabbed his image in many fans' eyes over the 13 years since. On the field, Lewis has put up sterling stats and is a surefire Hall of Famer. He's totaled more than 2,000 tackles since 1996 and was twice voted the Associated Press Defensive Player of the Year.  Do you think Burns Welker was right to blast Lewis' life off the field via Facebook, or should she have dealt with the Patriots loss some other way? Give us your take in the comments.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/30-rock-final-season-high-five-challenge/,'30 Rock' Fans Mark Final Season With Celebrity High-Five Challenge," Cold weather doesn't stop two comedians from commemorating the final season of 30 Rock.  Like Tina Fey's character Liz Lemon high-fiving a million angels (see clip below), funny folks Mark Malkoff and Kerri Doherty challenged themselves to high-five as many cast members of the NBC comedy as possible. But how?  The two stood outside the studio where 30 Rock is taped — Silvercup Studios in Long Island City in Queens, N.Y. — and held up signs emblazoned with their fan messages. 
 
""Kerri and I were outside for about three hours — it was absolutely freezing,"" Malkoff tells Mashable. ""30 Rock craft service bringing us hot chocolate helped a lot.""  Soon after crew members brought the duo warm drinks, an autographed poster and 30 Rock DVDs, some actors emerged from the studio to meet the comedians. The first high-five went to Jane Krakowski. And after waiting a bit longer, Fey slapped their hands.  ""Kerri thanked Tina for seven amazing seasons of 30 Rock,"" Malkoff says. ""Jane Krakowski mentioned that fans have never done anything like this before."" SEE ALSO: Adam Carolla Launches 'Video Podcast Network' on YouTube
 Missing from the high-five action was Tracy Morgan, who Malkoff notes Morgan's brother saying, ""Tracy doesn't like to walk. Maybe he'll come out on his Segway.""  30 Rock's hour-long final episode airs Jan. 31. This isn't Malkoff's first time doing something quirky on camera. He previously lived in an IKEA store for a week, hit up 171 Starbucks within 24 hours, brought a goat to an Apple Store, slept or napped in 13 Hollywood locations and watched 252 Netflix movies in a month.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/3d-printing-kickstarter-formlabs/,One 3D Printer's Astonishing Kickstarter Success,"Consumers are always on the lookout for truly innovative products, and this is no different with Formlabs, maker of a low-cost 3D printer that was embraced before it even came to market. But along with innovation often comes ethical or legal issues, and for the founders of Formlabs, that issue is the potential to use printers to create plastic guns.   The Formlabs team behind this innovative product are three MIT graduate students Maxim Lobovsky, David Cranor and Nate Linder. The three met in 2009 in MIT's ""How to Make (Almost) Anything"" class, and founded Formlabs together in September 2011.  Formlabs shattered its $100,000 goal on Kickstarter, and raised $2,945,885 — making the Form 1 3D printer the highest-funded tech campaign in Kickstarter history. The Form 1 can be pre-ordered at the discounted price of $3,299 through its website. Your products will be delivered in May; all pre-orders for April delivery are already sold out. Most 3D printers cost tens of thousands of dollars, so $3,299 is extremely low-cost, to put that price in perspective. SEE ALSO: 3D Printer Breaks Kickstarter Tech Funding Record
 If you've ever wanted to print 3D objects at home on-demand, now is your chance. Formlabs has completed development of the Form 1 3D printer, which is said to revolutionize the 3D printing landscape. Although there are a lot of 3D printers in the market today, the Form 1 is innovative and affordable compared with similar products — it is the highest-resolution low-cost 3D printer and uniquely uses a process called stereolithography.  We chatted with Maxim Lobovsky, who comments on Formlabs' Kickstarter success, offers some advice for aspiring tech startups and briefly touches on potential legal issues with 3D printing. Read on for the highlights. These days, we're seeing more and more 3D printers on the market — what differentiates the Form 1? The Form 1 is interesting for a couple reasons: 1) It is the highest resolution desktop printer available by far, and the reason for that is it uses a different process than any of the other desktop printers out there. It uses a process called stereolithography, as opposed to all the other low cost machines that use a process called fused deposition modeling (FDM) and our process allows for much higher accuracy and smaller features, and smoother surfaces than the FDM process does. We brought the technology which is gold standard to 3D printing and was only available in more expensive printers; we brought that down to a desktop and low cost. The other reason is that we made a complete end-to-end system with the software, machine, materials everything designed to work together, work out of the box; it's not meant to be maintained by the user. And in the end it is in a different class from the other desktop machines out there which are really kind of hobbyist, with our machine the goal is the get great quality output and use it in some other project. How do you see the Form 1 changing the tech landscape? I think there are a lot of applications for 3D printing and Form 1 will contribute to all of those: prototyping for new products, one-off parts for manufacturing and research, art or jewelry applications; we'll do all of those things but what we're most excited about is how we'll actually help people doing what we did, which is doing product development on a shoestring budget, launching on Kickstarter and stuff like that. This is actually the perfect tool for people doing a lot of work like that, so it's kind of a virtuous circle that we've built. Can you shed some light on your incredible success with Kickstarter? I think Kickstarter worked really well for us. Initially we were worried that Kickstarter wasn't perfectly aligned for the prosumer, higher-end product that we wanted to produce because it sort of looks a little hobbyist and informal. But I think it worked out great. We really focused on looking professional and showcasing the product and why it's innovative. We put a lot of effort into nice photography and a good video, but you know in the end it really comes down to people recognizing that this is a new and interesting product, and that's the most important thing. SEE ALSO: Everything You Wanted to Know About 3D Printing But Were Too Afraid to Ask
 Why did your team decide to use Kickstarter instead of similar platforms, like IndieGoGo? I think Kickstarter is the premier platform at this point; it has the biggest user base and more importantly for us, because it does some amount of curation of its projects it generally has higher quality content I would say, and it's important for us that we're seen in that light. What social platforms did you leverage to build awareness of the campaign? We tried to build it up before the launch by putting up the pre-launch website and doing teaser stuff on Twitter and that helped to get a number of people ready to go for when we launched. I think that is important because Kickstarter is a self-fulfilling prophecy, if you do well on the first day you get press not just about your product but about how well you did on the first day. I don't know if it's true, but it seems like how well you do on the first day really defines the rest of the campaign. So it is important to be ready to go. What tips could you give to other tech campaigns using Kickstarter? Tech campaigns are the second category least likely to reach their funding goals on Kickstarter, only above dance. Honestly I think that's a good thing and maybe the ratio needs to be even lower, because I think typically people aren't raising enough money or charging high enough prices for their actual hardware products on Kickstarter. Especially if it is your first product, people categorically always underestimate all the costs it's going to take to deliver their product. To generalize, some advice I could give is you have to prove that you can deliver on your product and it will do what you say.  Most people have a good idea for a product that somebody wants, and that part is maybe the less hard part, the harder part is convincing people that you can do it and it really is what you say it is. The biggest thing is to do everything well from the graphic design to the video — high production quality is important. One thing we did and what other successful campaigns have done was to get industry experts or people recognized in the field to talk about your video and your product, I think it helps to get a lot of third party approval. The biggest thing is tech projects need to get more serious about thinking about what is it actually going to take to deliver the project they want and on what timeframe. Are you worried about any upcoming legal action on 3D printers? Could Joe Schmoe be allowed to print a gun, for example? I think 3D printing is definitely going to bring up some interesting questions, copyright and things like that; we're following it as closely as anybody. Honestly, I think people may be overblowing the whole situation, I'm generally optimistic and I think things will work out generally positively. On the gun issue, 3D printers will change some of that, but generally you can do with 3D printers what you could do with other tools before, so I don't think 3D printers in everybody's home means there are going to be guns everywhere. That's not the case. Watch the video below to see the Form 1 3D printer in action. What would you print if you had a 3D printer? Let us know in the comments below.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/40-choice-out-loud/,Film Engages Millennials in Choice Dialogue on Roe v. Wade Anniversary," On the 40th anniversary of the Supreme Court's historic decision about a women's right to chose, the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws is kicking off a social-focused campaign targeting millennials. NARAL released the short film 40 on Tuesday to launch its new Choice Out Loud campaign.  ""40 is the beginning of a dialogue with a younger generation,"" Jeff Martin, 40's creative director told Mashable. ""We're going to have millennials be the core of the voting population in the next 15 years, and the dialogue about women's reproductive rights is a different dialogue than it's been in the past."" 40 is a stop-motion portrait of choice, incorporating the work of 40 photographers who shot (pro-bono) 40 pro-choice millennial women to make the film. While some of the subjects are models, others are teachers, activists and students. Martin said the photographers were given the freedom to shoot between 60 and 80 stills of their subjects of choice. ""We wanted to look at what choice looks like in America now,"" he said. The campaign aims to encourage a more personal and less political discussion about choice, NARAL said. ""This is a very personal topic; people don't talk about this in terms of politics,"" said Tarek Rizk, NARAL's communications director. ""We want to build a platform for a new conversation about choice, and find a place on the Internet for a conversation that's more personal and non-political. We're trying to meet people on their grounds, since there's new ways of thinking and new conversations happening."" Following the film's launch, Choice Out Loud will be screened on college campuses across the country with the hope of sparking personal conversations about reproductive rights.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/atari-games-bankruptcy/,"For Atari, Bankruptcy May Not Mean Game Over","After more than 30 years of shaping the video game industry, Atari could very well be facing its last hurrah, unless someone picks up the rights to its properties for them to live on. The company's U.S. division has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a move that is an effort to break away from its French parent company, Atari SA (formerly Infogrames), which acquired the company in 2008. A press release issued by Atari U.S. indicates that the company is looking to ""secure independent capital for future growth, primarily in the areas of digital and mobile games."" The company hasn't been pushing many retail releases as of late: Its last packaged game was the racer Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3last year. However, it's been highly active in the digital download and mobile markets, with such releases as the Xbox Live/PlayStation Network multiplayer battle game Warlords and mobile releases like the shooter Centipede: Origins and Circus Atari (which resembles the game Doodle Jump). Though Atari sees the bankruptcy as a reorganizational move, all of its assets are up for sale, including its game franchises (like Asteroids, Tempest and Test Drive), as well as its classic Atari logo.  SEE ALSO: Atari Legacy Still Going Strong At 40 Years
 The company didn't have any blockbuster games lined up at the time of its filing, but it released quite a few in the past, including Ghostbusters, a game that reunited the cast from the film (including Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, who lent their voices and likenesses to their characters) as playable video game characters fighting all-new spiritual entities. Considering the trouble that Atari has seen over the years — namely the 1983 video game market crash led by its poor video game treatment of E.T. the Extra Terrestrial — it's hard to see what its future could be like at the moment. Perhaps it will come up with a new business plan, one that forgoes blockbuster retail game releases in favor of more independent digital and mobile downloads, as it's been doing over the past few months. Atari could also find a better publishing partner, one who knows how to push a franchise into the current game scene. Ubisoft immediately comes to mind, considering the growth of its Rayman and Splinter Cell games, both of which will see new releases in 2013. Coming back from bankruptcy is always a road filled with bumps. But Atari has come back from failed partnerships and even a video game crash caused partly by its own blockbuster failure. There may be a bonus round yet. Image courtesy of Flickr, x-ray delta one

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/att-expand-wireless-spectrum/,AT&T Drops $780 Million to Expand Wireless Spectrum,"AT&T announced plans to purchase more wireless spectrum by acquiring the U.S. retail wireless operations of carrier Atlantic Tele-Network (ATNI), which is operated under the Alltel brand. The deal, which still must get regulatory approval, will cost the second-largest carrier in the U.S. $780 million in cash. Under terms of the agreement, AT&T will acquire wireless properties, including licenses, network assets, retail stores and approximately 585,000 subscribers. The acquisition includes spectrum in the 700 MHz, 850 MHz and 1900 MHz bands and is said to be largely complementary to AT&T's existing network. Under the Alltel brand, ATNI offers service to approximately 4.6 million people across six states. These include Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio and South Carolina. Once available in 34 states, most of Alltel was sold to Verizon Wireless in 2008. One year later, AT&T purchased additional parts of the company. In 2010, ATNI acquired the remaining 26 divested Alltel markets, including licenses, network assets and subscribers. AT&T will announce the company’s quarterly earnings on Jan. 24.

What people heard was a pre-recorded studio track of her singing the ""Star-Spangled Banner,"" The Times, TMZ and CNN confirmed. Before Monday's event, this photo on Beyonce's Instagram account showed her in what appears to be a recording studio.  Mashable received this statement from Marine Corps. media officer Eric Flanagan: The Presidential Inaugural Committee (PIC) requested that the Marine Band accompany Beyonce Knowles-Carter in the performance of the Star-Spangled Banner at the 2013 Inaugural Ceremony. However, there was no opportunity for Ms. Knowles-Carter to rehearse with the Marine Band before the Inauguration so it was determined that a live performance by the band was ill-advised for such a high-profile event.  Each piece of music scheduled for performance in the Inauguration is pre-recorded for use in case of freezing temperatures, equipment failure, or extenuating circumstances. Regarding Ms. Knowles-Carter's vocal performance, no one in the Marine Band is in a position to assess whether it was live or pre-recorded. Kelly Clarkson and James Taylor also performed during the inauguration, and TMZ's source with the U.S. Marine Band says Clarkson sang live.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/bill-gates-gods-work/,Bill Gates Is Now Doing 'God's Work',"Bill Gates, one of the richest men in the world, is known to be decidedly non-religious. In an interview this weekend, he broke from his usual tune with an uncharacteristic mention of God.  In an interview with UK newspaper The Telegraph, Gates addressed the consequences of his foundation's work in Pakistan. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has been working for the past few years to eradicate polio, which only remains in Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan. In Pakistan, some health workers have paid with their lives for distributing the vaccine, because Islamist groups have spread a belief that the vaccine is a Western evil. ""It’s not going to stop us succeeding,"" Gates says. ""It does force us to sit down with the Pakistan government to renew their commitments, see what they’re going to do in security and make changes to protect the women who are doing God's work and getting out to these children and delivering the vaccine."" The Microsoft co-founder rarely speaks in religious terms and previous discussion of his own beliefs have danced around the topic of God. His wife Melinda is a Roman Catholic, though she advocates for contraception in many cases against the church's teachings. SEE ALSO: Gateses Suggest 5 Tech-Savvy Ways to Give This Holiday Season
 In a 1995 interview with PBS's David Frost, he said he believed in the values derived from religion, though not the ritual itself. ""I'm not somebody who goes to church on a regular basis,"" Gates said. ""The specific elements of Christianity are not something I'm a huge believer in. There's a lot of merit in the moral aspects of religion. I think it can have a very, very positive impact."" The following year, he told Walter Isaacson for Time magazine that he found organized religion to be a waste of time. ""Just in terms of allocation of time resources, religion is not very efficient,"" he said. ""There's a lot more I could be doing on a Sunday morning."" Are we witnessing a spiritual change in Gates or is ""God's work"" just an idiom the Microsoft co-founder has embraced? Let us know what you think in the comments.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/biological-passport-sports-doping/,Can a High-Tech 'Biological Passport' End Sports Doping Forever?,"Lance Armstrong says it helped scare him off performance-enhancing drugs forever. It's already been implemented in track and field as well as cycling, and world tennis authorities are now considering adding it to their arsenal as well.  It's called the ""biological passport,"" a DNA fingerprint of sorts that may well be the next high-tech weapon to gain widespread use against doping in sports.  In his recent highly anticipated interview with Oprah Winfrey, Armstrong pointed to the biological passport as one of the main factors that thwarted his ability to take performance-enhancing drugs without detection.  ""It's a question of scheduling,"" Armstrong said. ""I know that sounds weird, but two things changed this. The shift to out-of-competition testing and the biological passport. And it really worked.""  Now Stuart Miller, who runs the International Tennis Federation's anti-doping efforts, tells USA Today that similar testing is ""being considered seriously"" in his sport, and that it could be put in place as early as next year.  The recent increase in attention raises a couple of obvious questions: How exactly does the biological passport work? And how effective could it really be?  In a nutshell, here's how the technology works: Rather than directly search for evidence of PEDs in an athlete's system, the biological passport method of enforcement uses a more comprehensive overview of athletes' individual biochemistry to search for abnormalities particular to them. Multiple samples are collected over time and stored electronically to create personal profiles, and those parameters are then used to judge future drug tests.  That, says the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport, allows regulators ""to see the big picture — any deviations from the athlete’s test-established norm that might result from doping, even if the specific drug or tactic remains unknown."" Many see the biological passport as an important step forward in the war on sports doping. And while it's gained a bit more notice in recent days, the system isn't that new. World cycling's governing body adopted it in 2008, while track and field's regulatory commission followed suit in 2010. Many cyclists have been punished for results detected under the program, and the Australian Football League just implemented a passport system of its own.  Its personalized and ""big picture"" nature, supporters say, make it better and more effective than other forms of testing. Many believe that the passport's high level of science acts as a powerful deterrent and detection tool. Armstrong, one of the most notorious dopers in sports history, seemingly confirmed that last week. Nonetheless, skeptics do caution that one be-all-end-all drug test will likely never exist in sports. As hard as regulatory bodies work to kill doping, athletes and their handlers will just as feverishly try to gain a competitive edge through whatever means possible.  Ross Tucker, a South Africa-based scientist who specializes in exercise physiology, has analyzed the biological passport on his website, The Science of Sport. He compares it to a set of well-positioned cameras placed in an area known for dangerous, speeding motorists. People will still find ways to drive faster than allowed, he argues, but overall instances of abuse will be curbed.   ""Will people still speed? Of course,"" Tucker writes. ""But will they speed less severely, and try to speed only when not being observed? Yes, and the end result is positive. Similarly, cyclists will dope, there is no doubt of this. But they will be more careful, and that has positive consequences."" How do you think sports doping should best be addressed by regulatory bodies? Give us your take in the comments.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/booking-com-35-million-ad-campaign/,This Is One 'Booking' Funny Ad Campaign," An Amsterdam-based travel site is looking to make a bigger name for itself in the U.S. with an estimated $35 million ad campaign that makes ""booking"" sound like a dirty word.  The campaign, via Wieden + Kennedy, Amsterdam, seeks to illustrate the feeling you get when you've booked well — especially when your friends and family are depending on you. The 60-second ad above shows various travelers experiencing that moment and presents a new use of the word ""booking,"" as in ""You've got it booking right"" and ""It doesn't get any booking better than this.""  Founded in 1996, Booking is a unit of Priceline, but one that competes with its parent company. Booking has been offering deals to U.S. customers for the past six years, but felt this was the time to draw more attention to its offerings. The brand faces a crowded list of competitors, though, including Orbitz, Travelocity, Hotels.com and Priceline. While those brands have run campaigns with memorable mascots (like the Travelocity gnome and Priceline's William Shatner), Booking is outlining some real pain points for U.S. travelers, who, after all, have the fewest average weeks of vacation per year of anyone in the industrialized world and are therefore under a lot of pressure to get it right.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/can-humans-live-on-mars/,Are We Meant to Live on Mars?,"Mars One will soon open the application process to be part of the first Mars colony in 2023, and it recently released the basic requirements to become a future member of this Red Planet community.  Are you at least 18 years old? Proceed. Do you have a ""can-do"" attitude? Keep reading. Are you in good physical health? Check.  Are you willing to spend the rest of your life on Mars without the possibility of returning to Earth? Pause. Re-read that sentence. Your future home on Mars is permanent, and understanding that is the most important criteria of an applicant. ""Once on Mars, there is no means to return to Earth. Mars is home. A grounded, deep sense of purpose will help each astronaut maintain his or her psychological stability and focus as they work together toward a shared and better future. Mars One cannot stress enough the importance of an applicant's capacity for self-reflection."" This isn't the first we've heard of colonizing Mars without the possibility of return. In fact George Herbert first introduced the concept in 1990 with a plan called ""Mars to Stay."" It proposed sending astronauts on a one-way mission to Mars to avoid the technological hiccups and costs associated with launching a return flight.  Mars One, a non-profit venture based in the Netherlands, is headed up by Dutch entrepreneur Bas Lansdorp. It plans to launch at least six groups of four people that will spend at least five years training together before launch. Every two years, another team of colonists will settle on Mars, adding to the overall population.  Other private Mars colonization projects — Mars Society and 4Frontiers are just two examples — operate under a similar lofty plan, with some minor differences. And these movements have their share of big-name supporters, including former astronaut Buzz Aldrin.  Even with a one-way flight, however, many political and technological concerns remain. When it comes to putting a man on Mars — let alone letting him live out his life there — some of the greatest minds in science remain divided on the subject.  Let's assume the technology exists (Mars One and other similar ventures say it does; other experts say it will take longer) and that the funding is there (Mars One estimates it will cost $6 billion. Meanwhile, NASA says it's hard to put a price on it, but for reference, the highly sophisticated Curiosity rover cost $2.5 billion.).  Even if all these seemingly unreachable factors fall into place, there still remains one basic problem that we'll never be able to control: human nature. Aside from the unknown physical health risks associated with living with 40% gravity, could we psychologically handle Mars without return? That's the question we wanted answered, and it's one that Mars colony supporters don't tend to address. Isolation and depression will be these colonists' darkest demons.  A few years ago, NASA put together a wildly imaginative plan for a round-trip manned mission to Mars. According to this report, one of the key challenges for a mission like this is behavior and performance deterioration during long-term spaceflight missions — and that's for astronauts who will actually return to Earth. The study points out that ""humans have never embarked upon spaceflight missions approaching the scale of exploration now envisioned."" So far, the best research that we have regarding this type of isolation comes from Antarctic and undersea expeditions. Marc Shepanek, lead for aerospace medicine at NASA, has been on one of these Antarctic missions himself. ""I prepared for the vast majority of things that I was going to experience,"" he explains. ""I had the benefit of having worked at NSF, working with people who had worked down South. I was very well-read, even for the research I helped report when I went down."" Despite months of training, heavy gear, knowing — and mentally absorbing — the fact that there would be a 90-degree drop in temperature, Shepanek didn't really understand the Arctic until he first stuck his head out the window. ""My face hurt from the drop of temperature [...] then it fully registered with me.""  ""I imagine the first time an astronaut experiences micro-gravity, sees the earth from that great height — no matter how much you have read, no matter how many pictures you have seen — I imagine that it's an experience,"" he says. ""Being human beings — even the most controlled, disciplined, capable human beings — it's going to be different when you do it.""  Shepanek does say humans are easily trained when it comes to social skills, and that includes mentally preparing for an extended period of isolation.  Mars One Medical Director Norbert Kraft agrees that no one can really understand how an isolated life on another planet will really affect them until they are actually there — of course by then it's too late.  Kraft says Mars One will do its best to prepare these pioneers with ten years of training that includes spending three months of every year inside an isolated habitat. ""Then we will see if they can handle that environment,"" Kraft tells Mashable. ""It's tough for someone to imagine that environment. You have to experience it to know if you're the person that can do this."" Even NASA has trouble assessing astronauts for long-term missions. During selection for a mission of this kind, applicants identified with a psychiatric disorder that would impede on-the-job success are removed from further consideration. As a result, some astronauts hide preexisting psychological conditions that could jeopardize their flight status. ""If someone were to go [into space] and something were to happen, there are regular private psychological conferences every two weeks and more frequent on a long term mission,"" Shepanek says. ""You can always request a private conference, and you always have access to a crew medical officer that's on board every mission."" However, even successful precautionary measures doesn't necessarily guarantee a healthy crew. The average age of onset depression for people who have no family history of depression is 41 years old. Astronauts selected for the Astronaut Corps can be as young as 26. Mars One will consider applicants as young as 18; those participants would be 28 when they land on Mars. The European Space Agency recently conducted a Mars mission simulation in which six volunteers were locked inside a spaceship for an unprecedented 520 days, making it the longest spaceflight or simulation in history. The results? The crew's overall movement progressively decreased, entering what the researchers called ""behavioral torpor."" They also experienced notable disturbances in sleep behavior.   ""Five of six crew members slept more, and it is usually sleep deprivation that is linked to depressive symptoms. [Of the six] only one crew member showed signs of (self-reported) depressive symptoms,"" says Mathias Basner, study co-author and assistant professor of Sleep and Chronobiology at University of Pennsylvania.  Basner says insufficient light in the chamber may have contributed to the depressive symptoms in the crew member. A Mars colonist would be subjected to similar indoor lighting conditions and confined spaces, but for an even longer period of time. When asked if, based on the information we currently have about Mars' environment, it's possible to predict how a human would psychologically react once he or she is there, Basner says ""absolutely not."" ""At this point, it is pure speculation, he says. ""The partial gravity and a longer than 24 hour day alone will be very challenging.""  Mars One has already received more than 1,000 emails from people interested in this mission, and the application process hasn't even started yet. But how will Mars One — or any Mars colonization project for that matter — whittle down the applicants into a small group of serious people in which private investors will pour billions? When assessing potential astronauts, NASA not only applies the rigorous background checks that come standard with government jobs, but the agency also puts its candidates through various physical tests and extensive interviews with both psychologists and psychiatrists.  However, Mars One's selection process is quite different. Certified physicians and scientists with years of experience will not select the future Mars colonists — you will. The public will choose the candidates who make it to the final round after a televised gameshow-like reality competition. There will be a national selection in which 20-40 applicants per country will participate in challenges ""that demonstrate their suitability to become one of the first humans on Mars."" This whole process will more than likely be broadcast on television, and the the audience will select the one applicant from their respective country that will move forward. Mars One will still have the final say of who goes to Mars, and crew selection will also depend heavily on how the members get along with each other, a key interpersonal component NASA also looks for when assessing astronaut candidates.  ""These people should be comfortable with being observed all the time,"" says Kraft. ""They won't have a lot of privacy."" On paper, a future colonist's day on Mars sounds similar to the life we live on Earth — do a job for eight hours per day, after which they can go ""home"" to call family or watch television. But, in reality, it's more like an extraterrestrial version of The Truman Show — a life lived under surveillance.  Like the vast majority of federal space agency experts, Shepanek believes that a round-trip manned mission to Mars should precede Mars colonization. An extended stay on Mars ""would be something to answer after we go for a short period of time,"" he says. The astronauts' health is NASA's No. 1 priority, according to Shepanek. When it comes to putting a man on Mars to live, however, there just simply isn't enough information to guarantee that. ""Working for NASA and knowing astronauts as I do, I want to keep them healthy. If given a choice, we like to bring our people home,"" Shepanek explains. ""It's not unlike the field — we leave no one behind. We will take care of health and safety no matter what. Failure is not an option."" Mars to Stay proponents, though, don't believe this one-way journey is a suicide mission. Its supporters point out that, historically, man has gone to the ends of the Earth without the promise of return in the name of exploration. Columbus, Frobisher and Scott embarked upon their missions at the expense of huge personal risks.  That notion of boundless exploration is one of the only things that both federal agency experts and Mars colony supporters can agree on when it comes to putting humans on the Red Planet.  ""If the kings of Spain and England could send people around a world that was potentially flat, I couldn't imagine that we wouldn't be capable of going to Mars and coming back,"" says Shepanek. ""People are flexible; they adapt. There are all kinds of people in history who have survived heroically [...] It's amazing what people can do when they have to.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/coca-cola-super-bowl/,Coca-Cola to Run Its Own Game During the Super Bowl," Coca-Cola is hoping some cross-media storytelling can maximize its estimated $11 million-plus Super Bowl ad spend and that consumers are up for another game during the Big Game. The cola giant on Monday unveiled a campaign called ""Coke Chase"" that pits three teams against each other and lets fans determine which of the teams will be featured in a post-game ad. The creative concept is that a group of Cowboys, Mad Max-style ""Badlanders"" and Showgirls are battling in a hot, sweltering desert for refreshment. The ad, which shows the three teams racing toward a giant Coke bottle only to see that they still have 50 milles to go, asks viewers to go to cokechase.com, where they can vote for the team they like best.  Coke is releasing a 30-second teaser for the ad on Tuesday and will run a 60-second version during the Super Bowl. (Coke will also run a :30 for another, yet-undetermined Coke brand.) The winning ad will run immediately after the game and complete the narrative of the spot. Though voting starts on Tuesday, the final votes will be tabulated during the game, so the winner will be chosen in real time. In addition to voting, fans can also opt to sabotage another team to set them back in the race. For instance, you can opt for a film in which the cowboys get stuck at a stoplight. This is the second ambitious cross-media campaign from Coke in as many years. Last year, the brand ran ads during the game that featured the brand's iconic polar bears reacting to the action on field. Meanwhile, a live feed during the game showed the bears watching throughout the full four hours or so of the game. The brand later claimed that 9 million people across various platforms checked in to see the polar bears.  ""People aren't going to necessarily interact with your product unless you tell a compelling story,"" says Pio Schunker, SVP of integrated marketing at Coke. ""This is the most engaging and compelling way in to talk about [Coke] as the ultimate thirst quencher.""  Image courtesy of Coca-Cola via YouTube "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/cracked-iphone-importance-screen-protectors/,When is a Cracked iPhone not a Cracked iPhone?,"Have you ever been unfortunate enough to crack your smartphone screen? I did — or at least I thought I did.  When I dropped my iPhone 4S on the kitchen floor last month, I told myself it was bound to happen at some point. I've been an iPhone user since the first one came out in 2007 and was pretty lucky until now. It usually landed on its case or a soft surface, but this time I actually heard the crunch as it hit the tile and saw the jagged crack on my screen. But as it turned out, after weeks of agonizing, my phone wasn't really cracked at all — just the screen protector was. I've spent years reporting on accessories, including cases and screen covers designed to protect your phone. But I've always used a case to hold my phone more for fashion than function. I finally put on a screen protector about six months ago, but not really for safety. I knew it would help keep the screen scratch-free, but I wanted a purple-rimmed iPhone and Apple doesn't make one. Thankfully, that thin, purple piece of glass saved my phone from the recycle bin.  SEE ALSO: Avoid These iPhone Danger Zones in Your Home  The below picture is what my phone looked like after it dropped. Looks bad, right? I brought it into work and showed it off in a meeting, which elicited the proper amount of sympathy. However, I showed my son who had less sympathy.   I continued to use it for a week or two and then upgraded to the iPhone 5. When I started to peel the screen protector away from the phone, I was amazed. The screen was perfectly fine — not a scratch on it. But the screen protector, well, that broke into pieces.  The screen protector I was using at the time — called Shell Shock by Cellairis   — is supposed to withstand more pressure than a regular screen protector, the company later told me. It's made of impact resistant tempered glass, so it absorbs pressure or damage that would normally scratch or shatter the screen. Although I didn't realize it was going to lay down its life to protect the phone, I certainly dodged a bullet. Cellairis says in cases like this, customers are able to receive a replacement screen, if the protector is still under the one-year warranty. SEE ALSO: The 10 Coolest iPhone and iPad Cases From CES Not all screen protectors are the same. Many on the market are shields that protect the screen from scratches from being jostled around in your bag, while others have a sturdy case with a lip that extends to the front. Whatever you opt for, just be sure to consider one that could end up saving your smartphone's life. Have you ever cracked the screen on your iPhone? How do you protect your screen?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/email-auto-filtering-marketing/,Email Auto-Filtering: What's a Marketer to Do?,"There has been a lot of conversation recently around the increasing presence of auto-filtering for managing inbox clutter. With companies like OtherInbox, SaneBox and AOL Alto, the reality of your email communication being filtered out of the inbox and into a folder may be a reality you already face. And if not, it will be one you will likely face soon as adoption of these types of tools continues — both by consumers and business users alike.  While there has been a lot of conjecture around this reality, very little has been shared around the considerations we need to make as marketers, such as how it will affect our engagement rates, offer adoption and impressions on subscribers. Let's dive into these considerations a little deeper. Whether it's a folder or a ""stack,"" your email marketing message has found itself tightly aligned with other email communications from competitors and other vertically aligned organizations. Many systems have default categorizations that look at a variety of information within the marketing message and the email envelope to tuck the message away neatly for the recipient.  There are a number of challenges associated with this, but one of the biggest is that it doesn't matter when you sent that message — you aren't appearing at the top of the inbox. You may be at the top of the ""travel"" or ""shopping"" folder — right alongside the likes of your competitors, or the other four messages you sent in the last seven days.  The landscape and view of how and when your subscribers see your email is changing. Does this fact impact your business? For some of you the answer is absolutely. For others, you may be less concerned. Let's take a more positive look at what this might mean for a marketer. Let's say you are a travel and hospitality organization and your email has been placed into the ""travel"" category. The act of the subscriber clicking into the ""travel"" folder means that she is likely already in the mindset to engage with a travel offer or communication — otherwise she would be in the ""social"" folder or someplace else.  While the impressions may be slightly more limited, it's very possible that a recipient looking at messages with a very specific focus might just be more inclined to engage than if the message were in the inbox. Every ""pro"" has its ""con."" One of the advantages of sending messages that resonate with the customer, leveraging behavior and predictive opportunities, is to ""remind"" the customer that she wants to engage, subconsciously.  By removing the message from the inbox and placing it in the ""travel"" folder, the consumer has to make a conscious choice to look in the travel folder. Sometimes the mere act of seeing a great deal in the inbox is enough to drive the engagement — even if the consumer didn't ""know"" she was looking for it. The ability to engage spontaneously is greatly minimized, if not removed completely, by email auto-filtering. Unless the consumer is regularly checking a specific folder (or all of her folders), the days of last-minute deals catching the eye of the customer may be gone (or greatly impacted). Imagine if a customer opens up the travel folder only to find a number of deals from you and your competitors that are all expired.  This reality may frustrate consumers. A potential solution here is to use technologies and partners that optimize and render content at the moment of an open (Moveable Ink is an example). While it has historically been applied in very specific situations, the need for such an ability may increase if auto-filtering really takes hold. Delivery and inbox placement aren't going to be enough to gain proper insight into what is happening with your email. And the reality of an open action occurring days (vs. hours) after a message has been sent is a strong reality. If you're starting to see great lag times in engagement metrics or decreasing engagement, it may be time to consider the possibility that auto-filtering (or auto-foldering) is impacting your performance. There isn't a lot of fodder out there right now about how to combat, address, or embrace the possibility of auto-filtering really taking off, but it's important to start thinking about it now. Consumers are increasingly fatigued on email clutter. This just may be their solution to it. How are you going to address it? Image courtesy of Flickr, Ryan Somma

""We were surprised by how many people have a negative experience from Facebook with envy leaving them feeling lonely, frustrated or angry,"" researcher Hanna Krasnova at Berlin's Humboldt University told Reuters. What Krasnova's team did, in a couple of separate trials, was to record emotional responses to posts in 600 representative Facebook users. No prizes for guessing which emotion came out on top.  The causes of envy were many, and some read like some fascinating conversation-starters: holiday photos started more than half of the envy incidents. People in their 30s were more likely to be envious of scenes of family happiness.  They also found some very bad news for Mark Zuckerberg & Co.: Facebook envy is a very real factor in reducing Facebook usage.  ""From our observations some of these people will then leave Facebook or at least reduce their use of the site,"" Krasnova said.  ""Our findings signal that users frequently perceive Facebook as a stressful environment, which may, in the long-run, endanger platform sustainability,"" added the study. User numbers suggesting Facebook is becoming a mature market in the U.S., which could exacerbate the problem. The Facebook honeymoon is over. So how does ""Facebook envy"" and ""Facebook stress"" reconcile with the previous study on ""Facebook togetherness?"" Quite easily, as it turns out. One experiment focused on people being active on Facebook; they were writing more than the average user. The other was explicitly trying to determine how emotions were linked to passive use. ""Passive following triggers invidious emotions, with users mainly envying happiness of others, the way others spend their vacations and socialize,"" read the report, called ""Envy on Facebook: A Hidden Threat to Users' Life Satisfaction?"" Clearly more study is needed. But here's a sensible conclusion to draw thus far: Either you're creating content on Facebook, or you're consuming it. The former will give you an uplifting sense of community; the latter will make you green with jealousy. Zuckerberg had better hope you feel more than the former.  Image via Flickr, Steel Wool "

The FBI and USA Networks have created ""Real Life White Collar Crimes"" to let people help the FBI solve real crimes revolving around stolen items. The campaign will live online via photo galleries and investigative tidbits about open cases, while on-air promotions will showcase one stolen item each week. Participants can submit leads to the FBI and earn GetGlue stickers related to ""Real Life White Collar Crimes.""  One case involves the 286-year-old Davidoff-Morini Stradivarius violin. A thief stole the violin, which is valued at more than $3 million, from its owner's deathbed in 1995.  USA Network tells Mashable the stolen items include ""various artifacts, antiques, artwork and other valuables from around the world"" such as Walt Whitman's notebooks, Native American Ledger Paintings and paintings by Puerto Rico's Jose Campeche y Jordan.

The phone, developed by Geeksphone (in partnership with Telefonica), is a mid-range smartphone by today's standards: it's powered by a 1 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S1 CPU, has a 3.5'' HVGA multi-touch screen, a 3-megapixel camera, 512MB of RAM and 4GB of ROM memory.  It comes with a microSD memory card slot, Wi-Fi N, MicroUSB slot, plus a variety of sensors, including light, proximity and g-sensor.  Finally, the device supports 2G, 3G HSPA and comes with a 1580 mAh battery.  Those specs are nothing to write home about, but it's in line with Mozilla's idea of making a very accessible mobile platform.  The device should become available in February, at a yet unannounced price.  Mashable Composite. Images courtesy of Mozilla "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/first-photos-black-holes/,What Will First Photos of Black Holes Look Like?,"A giant black hole is thought to lurk at the center of the Milky Way, but it has never been directly seen. Now astronomers have predicted what the first pictures of this black hole will look like when taken with technology soon to be available. In particular, researchers have found that pictures of a black hole or, more precisely, the boundaries around them will take a crescent form, rather than the blobby shape that is often predicted.  By modeling what these pictures will look like, scientists say they are preparing to interpret the photos that will become available from telescopes currently under construction. ""No one has been able to image a black hole,"" said University of California, Berkeley student Ayman Bin Kamruddin, who presented a poster on the research last week in Long Beach, Calif., at the 221st meeting of the American Astronomical Society. ""So far it's been impossible because they're too small in the sky. Right now we're just getting some details about the structure, but we don't have an image yet.""  SEE ALSO: Gallery: Black Holes of the Universe
 Black holes themselves are invisible, of course, as not even light can escape their gravitational clutches. However, the boundary of a black hole — the point of no return called the event horizon — should be visible from the radiation emitted by matter falling into the black hole. ""A black hole's immediate surroundings have a lot of really interesting physics going on, and they emit light,"" Kamruddin said. ""Technically speaking, we aren't exactly seeing the black hole, but we are effectively resolving the event horizon."" A new project called the Event Horizon Telescope combines the resolving power of numerous antennas from a worldwide network of radio telescopes to sight objects that otherwise would be too tiny to make out. ""The Event Horizon Telescope is the first to resolve spatial scales comparable to the size of the event horizon of a black hole,"" said Kamruddin's collaborator, University of California, Berkeley astronomer Jason Dexter. ""I don't think it's crazy to think we might get an image in the next five years."" The Event Horizon Telescope already has been gathering some preliminary measurements of the object called Sagittarius A* (pronounced ""Sagittarius A-star"") at the center of our Milky Way galaxy. Kamruddin and Dexter have matched this data to various physical models and found that they best fit images that are crescent-shaped, rather than the blob shapes called ""asymmetric Gaussians"" that had been previously used in models. The crescent shape emerges from the flat doughnut, called an accretion disk, formed by matter orbiting a black hole on its way to falling in. As gas spins around the black hole, one side of the disk comes toward view on Earth, and its light becomes brighter because of a process called Doppler beaming. The other side, representing receding gas, gets dimmer because of this effect. In the center of the crescent is a dark circle called the black hole shadow, which represents the black hole itself — an incredibly dense object where space-time is extremely twisted. ""There's really extreme bending of light happening because of general relativity and the extremely strong gravitational field,"" Kamruddin said. Knowing that the crescent model best fits the data allows the researchers to discriminate between different models describing the physics around the black hole. Ultimately, the astronomers hope to use the first photos of Sagittarius A* to accurately weigh the behemoth at the center of the Milky Way. ""Just getting an image itself will be mind-blowing,"" Kamruddin said. ""It will provide direct confirmation of the event horizon, which has been predicted, but no one's ever actually seen it. Seeing what it is like will rule out certain physics."" Images courtesy of A. Fujii /NASA; Kamruddin/Dexter

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/flu-advice-online-reliable/,How Much Flu-Related Advice Should You Take From the Internet?,"The flu is particularly nasty this year. Flu season is typically the worst at the beginning of the year, but can start as early as October and last as long as May. And this year's virus is especially bad.  On social media, 626,379 people reported having the flu in the last six weeks — a  2,336% increase from the previous month. With the recent outbreaks of both colds and flu, whether you're sick, or trying to avoid getting sick, we're guessing you've turned to Google to search for information. But how much cold and flu information can you trust from a web search? Dr. Charles Chiu, M.D., Ph.D., an infectious diseases physician at University of California, San Francisco Medical Center, tells Mashable you should be very cautious with any information you find using a Google search.  SEE ALSO: Track the Spread of Flu With These Apps ""I'm actually not in favor of members of the general public searching for online (health) information and making self-diagnoses without sharing this information with their physician,"" he says. ""There’s a lot of inaccurate information out there and in some cases it’s inconsistent.""  However, the online source from which you find your health information is very important, he says. Sites like the CDC website, state and local public health departments, and dedicated medical sites are much more reliable than message boards, for instance. If you're finding information from articles, message boards and forums, that information could be inaccurate. Whereas health information on sites like WebMD, PubMed, UpToDate or MDConsult may have been reviewed by doctors, Chiu says. Those sites could be a good place to find information, but shouldn't take the place of a doctor visit.  Chiu says he thinks it's OK to diagnose yourself so long as you confirm your suspicions by talking to a doctor.   ""It is possible, for instance, that the illness is not routine flu but something more serious that needs medical attention,"" he says. ""Such as strep throat, atypical bacterial pneumonia, hantavirus (if history of exposure), etcetera.""  A basic Google search is also OK for specific things related to health, like if you want to know if something is covered by your health insurance, or if you want to read others' reviews about which OTC medication is best for treating the flu, so long as you don't diagnose yourself using information from the web.  SEE ALSO: For Health Answers, People Consult the Internet Over Doctors [STUDY]  ""I think of it as this can give you important ancillary information so long as you're not using that as your only source of information and not exclusively relying on that,"" Chiu says.  Dr. Michael Smith, chief medical editor for WebMD tells Mashable, that the information on WebMD is ""intended to educate and inform readers on health and wellness issues, so that they can have more efficient and more informative discussions with their doctors."" Smith is confident you can rely on WebMD's information. However, the website also encourages patients to always consult with their physicians. To ensure the flu information you're reading on the Internet is reliable, make sure there is a physician involved in creating the content, Smith says. And make sure sources are cited. Credible sources include the CDC and NIH, nonprofit health organizations and peer reviewed medical journals. Also, make sure the information is current. Based on how often health information changes, your best bet is to look for flu information that has been reviewed within the last couple of years, Smith says.  ""Medicine, just like any other field, is rapidly changing,"" Chiu says. We have websites that review doctors and healthcare providers, but he predicts that in the future that will expand into rating medical advice, like forums and other health information on the Internet so consumers can find the most accurate information. Regardless of what you find on the Internet, it's probably best to see a specialist if you're experiencing new symptoms or just want to be sure.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/france-internet-tax/,France Considering an 'Internet Tax' on Personal Data,"France is considering a so-called ""Internet tax"" on data collection activities by Facebook, Google and other technology companies.  The proposed tax would put a financial value on the personal information scooped up by those firms and used for advertising and other user-based customization. Dues would then be calculated based on the amount of personal data collected, as measured by outside observers. The idea was proposed in a report on the matter commissioned by French President François Hollande delivered Friday, first reported by The New York Times. Personal data is considered by some to be among the brightest possibilities for Internet-based economic growth. The report acknowledges this possibility, calling data the ""raw material"" of Internet business. The French report also argues that users of services such as Google or Facebook are, in effect, working for those companies without pay by providing them with their personal information. Many, however, see that information exchange as the ""cost"" of using the otherwise free services those companies provide. There's an economic rationale behind the tax as well: France's technology sector is dominated by well-established American players that pay little in French taxes while trouncing local competition, aggravating some French business owners and lawmakers. ""We want to work to ensure that Europe is not a tax haven for a certain number of Internet giants,"" France's digital economy minister, Fleur Pellerin, told the Times and other reporters in Paris on Friday. Google told the Times that it was reviewing Friday's report. ""The Internet offers huge opportunities for economic growth and employment in Europe, and we believe public policies should encourage that growth,"" a Google spokesperson added. SEE ALSO: Google Reportedly Dodged $2 Billion in Taxes With Bermuda Tax Haven Google, specifically, has been the subject of a two-year French investigation into its tax practices. Google and other American technology companies have been accused by French officials of dramatically reducing their taxes in part by placing their European headquarters in Luxembourg or Ireland, which have lower tax rates. ""It appears that Google, Facebook or others, who are located in France, are not submitted to the same conditions, as far as tax and [Value Added Tax] are concerned, as the French players,” Pellerin said in an earlier interview with Bloomberg TV. ""That doesn’t set the right conditions for a fair competition."" Google maintains that its tax practices are fully legal. “Google complies with tax law in every country in which it operates and we are confident we comply with French law,"" a Google spokesperson told Bloomberg.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/google-q4-earnings/,Google Has Its First $50 Billion Year,"It looks like 2012 was a pretty good year for Google.  The company hit $50 billion in annual revenue last year for the first time ever thanks in part to the strength of its fourth quarter earnings. Google generated $14.42 billion in the December quarter, an increase of 26% from the same quarter in 2011, and beating Wall Street's estimates of $12.36 billion in revenue for the quarter. By comparison, Google generated just under $38 billion in revenues in 2011. ""We ended 2012 with a strong quarter,” said Larry Page, CEO of Google. “Revenues were up 36% year-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter. And we hit $50 billion in revenues for the first time last year – not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half."" Investors had been somewhat concerned about the earnings report in recent days after Google's treasure and chief accountant advised analysts to re-think their estimates to account for the sale of Motorola's set top box business. While revenues handily beat Wall Street's estimates, not everything in the report was positive. Google's cost-per-clicks declined by 6% from the same period a year ago as mobile ads continue to become more prominent. Even so, this earnings report went better than the previous quarter, when Google's filing agency accidentally leaked the earnings report early during trading hours. This, combined with a big miss on net revenue and earnings, sent Google's stock crashing down below $700 a share.  Google's stock was up more than 4% in after hours trading following the earnings report. Image courtesy of Flickr, Joi "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/hacker-finds-easy-way-to-secretly-save-snapchat-poke-pictures/,Hacker Finds Easy Way to Secretly Save SnapChat Pictures,"A kink within the controversial SnapChat app may let users secretly capture screen shots of private pictures without notifying the sender. Although SnapChat has developed a reputation as being a sext-friendly platform — allowing people to share sexy or naked pictures before it's automatically deleted a few seconds later — and Facebook has been experimenting with a similar private photo platform with its Poke app, senders are typically notified when the recipient takes a screen shot of the image as a part of a security measure. But according to University of Michigan student and hacker Raj Vir — and first reported by TechCrunch, it's easy to sneak screen shots of incoming images without the sender knowing. SEE ALSO: App Turns Smartphone Into a Sex Toy for Couples
 ""I was curious about how SnapChat detects screen shots and discovered they aren't as secure as you'd think,"" Vir told Mashable. ""If you are a SnapChat user, you just assume it's protected, but it's not that hard to get around."" After taking a screen shot of a picture sent via the SnapChat app, Vir said users can double tap the home button to bring up the multi-tasking bar.  ""While taking a screen shot by holding the home and power button at the same time, keep a finger on the screen to hold the picture. When you let go and see the snaps section again, tap the home button twice before the picture disappears,"" Vir said. ""This cancels SnapChat's detection and you can view the picture on your phone as many times as you want."" Vir said there are other ways to get around it too, such as putting the phone in standby mode by making it sleep, and logging in and out of the app to turn on Airplane Mode. ""This work-around occurs because Snapchat isn't officially supported by Apple, so it's a hack in the first place,"" he said. ""Although Facebook does it differently for its Poke app, you can force quit the app and take screen shots this way with Poke too."" Does this hack make you hesitant to use Snapchat or similar apps?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/hbo-rules-girls-gif-tumblr/,HBO Has Surprisingly Strict Rules for 'Girls' GIFs on Tumblr,"A new Tumblr from HBO called ""What Should We Call Girls"" (WSWCG) is the official home for GIF animations for the hit TV show. Fans of the show, which follows four women as they navigate relationships and jobs in New York City, are also encouraged to submit their own, only there's a catch. The blog's right hand column features the ""GIF (SPIRIT) Guidelines,"" a list of requirements that must be followed when submitting animations gleaned from the Golden Globe-winning show, including ""All GIRLS content in GIFs must be obtained from authorized sources of HBO programming""  ""What Should We Call Girls"" borrows its name from a meme, and its format from other successful single serving blogs like #myfriendsaremarried, which feature funny GIFs with funny phrases above them. But in this case, each funny phrase must be ""a direct quote from GIRLS.""  Despite the strict GIF rules, WSWCG has published more than 100 animations, averaging around 100 notes each. But that hardly compares to unofficial Girls-related Tumblr blogs like Fuck Yeah Girls HBO and Girls Caps, which are stocked with random GIFs and images that have collected thousands of notes. Such restrictions on how content is shared or interacted with are nothing new for HBO. Over the past year, HBO has refused to offer its beloved HBO Go streaming service to people who do not have a cable subscription. Currently, HBO Go is free with the purchase of an HBO subscription, but many people are willing to pay between $4 to $40 a month just for the streaming service. The restriction inspired the poll Take My Money, HBO! in June where people could vent their frustrations and share how much they would pay for HBO Go. The Girls Tumblr blog has not caused any sort of outrage (yet) but has made GIF artist collective Mr. GIF question HBO's intentions. ""It is pretty funny that they put so many constraints on what you can submit,"" Mr. GIF told the Daily Dot. ""It looks like its a legal thing. I mean it seems like a odd barrier for entry though. You would imagine that the goal is to get as many people as possible to submit."" Images courtesy of HBO; What Should We Call Girls

 The ad shows Upton standing around and posing in slow motion while a bunch of average-looking dudes in football jerseys wash the new-model Benz. While it's doubtful the video, posted by the official Mercedes-Benz USA YouTube account is an actual leak as speculated by the New York Post, it probably does foreshadow what Upton and Mercedes hope will be a Super Bowl splash.  Either way, the video posted Monday has proven popular, already amassing nearly 75,000 views. Check it out above and let us know what you think in the comments.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/khoi-vinh-joins-etsy/,Former 'NYT' Web Design Director Khoi Vinh Joins Etsy,"Etsy has acquired the four-person team behind photo collage-making app Mixel to build up its mobile team, Etsy confirmed on Tuesday. By all appearances, the online crafts marketplace acquired Mixel not for its product, which allows users to collaboratively create, edit and share photo collages, but for its talent. Mixel's parent company, Lascaux Co., was co-founded in early 2011 by Khoi Vinh, the well-known former design director of the NYTimes.com (who will now assume the role of product design director for mobile at Etsy), and Scott Ostler, co-founder of real-time image sharing site dump.fm. The company's two employees, software developer Akiva Leffert and designer Roy Stanfield, will also be joining Etsy's mobile team. Given Mixel's double focus on mobile and design, its team appears well qualified to take charge of Etsy's mobile strategy going forward. It's well-timed, too: Etsy expects to receive more traffic from mobile than desktop devices by the end of 2014, according to CTO Kellan Elliot-McCrea.  And what about Mixel? In a note posted to its website, Mixel promised users that they can continue to use the app to make and download collages, but the app's social features will soon be phased out. An Etsy spokesperson said that Etsy, for its part, has no intention of getting into the photo-sharing/collage business. Photo courtesy of Flickr, FontShop "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/lg-optimus-g-pro/,Powerful LG Optimus G Pro Has Surprise Debut in Japan,"The LG Optimus G was already a powerful smartphone, but now LG is taking it up another notch with the Optimus G Pro. A Japanese wireless carrier just unveiled the phone as part of its new lineup, and the specs are impressive. The LG Optimus G Pro, announced by Japan's NTT Docomo and spotted by Engadget, has a large 5-inch screen with full HD resolution — 1,920 x 1,080. That gives the display a pixel density of 440 pixels per inch (ppi), the same as the HTC Droid DNA. We found the DNA's screen to be extremely crisp, so it's stands to reason the Optimus G Pro will look just as good. The phone is slightly thicker than the non-pro version — 0.4 inch to 0.33 inch — likely to accommodate the larger battery, which holds 3,000 mAh of juice. The processor is a 1.7GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 quad-core design, and it runs Android 4.1 ""Jelly Bean."" Of course, it's equipped to connect with NTT Docomo's LTE network, and Wi-Fi tethering supports up to eight devices. SEE ALSO: Hands-On: LG's New Flagship Smartphone, the Optimus G
 At 13 megapixels, the Optimus G Pro's camera is in line with the resolution of other top-shelf phones, and the front-facing camera is improved, too, with a 2.4-megapixel sensor. Although the camera and screen resolution are probably overkill, it's good to see flagship smartphones are moving into quad-core, with larger batteries and better front-facing cameras. It's hitting Japan in April, but here's been no official announcement of the phone from LG, so a U.S. release is still an unknown at this point.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/library-use-study-pew/,Libraries' Love Affair With Print Is Far From Over,"While residents of Bexar County, Texas, may be embracing a proposal for the nation's first local library free of printed books, not all Americans are crazy about the notion, a survey released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center indicates. The survey reveals just how important libraries are to their communities, and ranks the popularity of the services they offer. According to Pew, six in 10 Americans above the age of 15 either visited a library or bookmobile, or accessed a library website, in the past year. Uses varied: Most (around 73%) visited a library to borrow print books, and nearly as many (66%) used the Internet. More than half stopped by to do research or solicit the help of a reference librarian. Others simply passed the time reading and or studying (49%), checked out DVDs (40%) or CDs (16%), or met with a group (23%). Although more e-books are now sold each year than hardcover books, e-books are not yet very popular at libraries. As mentioned previously, nearly three-fourths of library visitors go to check out print books. Far fewer turn to their libraries for e-books: Of the 25% of survey participants who visited a library website in the past year, only 22% said they borrowed or downloaded an e-book. That may be partly because many libraries don't yet offer e-books for checkout. In a focus group conducted by few, several said e-book borrowing would ""rekindle their interest in the library."" ""While many patrons appreciate bring able to access new digital resources at libraries, they also say they value having print books and other traditional resources at libraries and still want a personal connection with library staff,"" Kathryn Zickuhr, research analyst at Pew, observed in a press statement. ""Many libraries are torn between expanding their digital offerings on the latest platforms and still providing quality resources for patrons who may lack experience with technology or the means to own the latest devices."" In addition to use habits, Pew compiled a laundry list of items patrons want from their libraries: The ability to borrow books (80%).
 More e-books (83%).
 IPS navigation for locating books (62%).
 Access to reference librarians (80%).
 Redbox-style kiosks for renting books in public spaces outside the library (63%).
 Free access to Internet-connected computers (77%).
 An online ""ask a librarian"" service (73%).
 Access to library materials via apps (63%).
 An area to try out new devices (69%).
 Amazon-style recommendation engines based on past checkout history (64%).
 Free literacy programs for young children (82%).
 Yet when asked whether they would be willing to give up existing resources to make room for these things — to move some books to off-site storage centers to make sense for a device-testing center, for instance — only 20% of survey participants said they were in favor. Thirty-six percent said libraries should ""definitely"" not move books off-site. Which sums up the whole problem, really. Image courtesy of Flickr, AZ Adam "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/mailbox-app-review/,Is Mailbox the Best Email App for iPhone Yet?,"The first thing I did after becoming a smartphone owner in late 2009 was check my email. There were no new messages when I checked that morning, but that didn't matter: After years of using feature phones, nothing seemed more exciting to me than just having the option to check my email on the go. Over time, though, this proved to be more of a curse than a blessing to my email inbox. I've never considered myself the most digitally organized person, but even I noticed my inbox spiral out of control after getting a smartphone as my friends and I started sending each other more messages and I forwarded myself more articles, tweets and reminders for work.  Within a few months, I went from having hundreds of unread messages at any given time to thousands. Even the best email apps on the market only made it easier to check and send messages, not to organize them.  That's why my ears perked up a couple months ago when I first heard about Mailbox, an as yet unreleased iPhone app from Orchestra — the startup behind the popular to-do list app of the same name — which promised to help users keep their inbox at zero by introducing a scheduling option for when to read and respond to incoming messages.  So for instance, you can opt to have a message resent to your inbox later that night when you get home from work or over the weekend when you have more time to respond.  Prior to this, the only real options for email were to respond immediately or let it sit in your inbox; Mailbox offered a third way. I'm not usually one to get antsy for the launch of an app, but I found myself pinning all hopes for a better future for my inbox on Mailbox — and it looks like I'm not the only one. The company posted a teaser video (see below) for the app in mid-December, which was viewed 250,000 times in the first day and has since racked up more than 600,000 views. Meanwhile, about 70,000 people have signed up to be on the waiting list for the app. It will still be another ""few weeks"" before Mailbox hits Apple's App Store, but on Tuesday the company launched a formal reservation system on its website and plans to start rolling out the app to those who sign in the order that they signed up. (The reason for the staggered roll out is just to make sure that there are no server issues with the app as more people sign up.) So does the app live up to all the hype? I've been testing Mailbox for the past few days and the app is definitely better than any other app on the market in helping to manage the flow of emails, but there is still room for improvement.  Mailbox certainly isn't the first app that has tried to improve on Apple's default email application. Both Sparrow and Gmail launched on the iPhone to plenty of hype, adding more bells and whistles to the standard email app. But the goal of Mailbox isn't just to make Apple's email app better, it's to rethink email for mobile all together.  ""For the most part, apps that exist have tried to cram an existing desktop experience into a mobile phone. That's not a very effective way of building a good tool,"" said Gentry Underwood, CEO of Orchestra. ""I think most people have a poor email experience on the phone and are hungry for something better."" Perhaps the biggest difference between checking email on mobile and desktop is that on mobile, people are performing what Underwood calls ""triage,"" meaning they are just trying to make quick decisions about how to handle their messages while away from their desktop.  With that in mind, the team at Orchestra set out to build an app that makes it easier for users to sort messages as they come in. The centerpiece of Mailbox is a feature called ""snooze"" that lets users swipe across a message in their inbox to schedule being reminded about it at a later date.  When you take this step, the message is removed from your main inbox and placed in a separate folder (think of it as your Read It Later folder) and it will be re-sent to your inbox at the designated time or date. In addition to scheduling messages, you can also use Mailbox to organize email on the go by swiping to add messages to one of several built-in lists, including ""to watch,"" ""to read"" and ""to buy."" Each of these lists also show up as folders in Gmail. All of these features are intended to keep your inbox uncluttered without actually deleting incoming messages.  Sparrow has been my go-to app for the iPhone pretty much since it launched last March — though I will sometimes rely on the Gmail app just to search through old messages and sorting my inbox lists. Sparrow's strength, in my eyes, is that it has intuitive swipe gestures, displays my many Gmail labels, makes it easy to manage multiple email accounts and adds pictures for each of my contacts, all of which somehow make the inbox feel a little more personal and pleasant to deal with. Mailbox, on the other hand, is missing some of the simpler perks that come with Sparrow and other email apps. You can't see your Gmail lists, or swipe to send messages to an existing Gmail list, which would be very useful for staying organized. You can't add pictures to your contacts, like you can with Sparrow. And there is also no option to select multiple emails at once as you can with Gmail or Apple's mail app, though that's mainly because Mailbox is designed to handle each message as it comes in. That said, the app has far more potential than any other on the market as an organizational tool and it improves on some basic features as well. For example, email threads are presented more plainly and all on one page, which makes it easier to track long back-and-forth conversations, and the search functionality is on par with Gmail. Ultimately, the selling point of the app is a single feature — scheduling — which raises the question of what would happen if other competing apps simply decide to copy this feature. Underwood acknowledged this was a potential risk in our interview. ""Once you create something that's so obvious, it will change what comes down the road,"" he said. ""We're going to need to continue innovating because other people will almost certainly follow."" The Mailbox team already has several big ideas in place for future updates, which focus on using the built-in strengths of mobile to make the email experience better, including finding ways to automate the organizational process, develop new options for users to respond to incoming messages and perhaps incorporate location and other data for scheduling emails. If Mailbox can implement this suite of features, it may just define email for the mobile era.   The best and worst thing I can say about Mailbox is that it taps into the power of procrastination. I felt a strong sense of relief while using the app just knowing that I had a way to delegate incoming messages for later, but after a few days I found it allowed me to deal with many of my emails by not dealing with them.  In a way, it's fitting that Mailbox refers to its scheduling feature as ""snooze."" Just as with an alarm, it's nice to have the option to hit snooze once or twice to give yourself a little more time, but there is always the potential for procrastinators like me to abuse this system and mistake the choice to delay being productive for productivity itself.  In the time I've used Mailbox, I've noticed that the number of read and unread messages in my inbox hasn't increased by as much as usual, but I know many additional messages are still hiding out in folders, waiting for a response. Now that we're stuck with email following us everywhere we go, at least we can get a little respite, even if sometimes that means we're just basically playing mind games with ourselves.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/mega-complete-guide/,Everything You Need to Know About Kim Dotcom's Mega,"Mega is the new cloud-based storage service from Kim Dotcom. Born from the ashes of Megaupload, the service purports to be a secure way to trade files, regardless of type. To create a Mega account, you simply need an email address. Remember the password you choose. There is no account recovery and Mega users who can't remember their passwords will be unable to access their accounts. After signing up for Mega, the server creates a 2,048-bit  public/private key pair. This pair encrypts all access to the Mega servers from your web browser. The file manager is sparse. It supports drag and drop for file uploads or via a menu option. You can upload files or folders to the service. Files are queued and upload one after another. If you need to do multiple uploads, you can upload additional files in a separate browser tab. Downloading files is simple, simply double click the file's name or right click and select download. Users can share folders with individuals they choose. Right click on a folder and choose share.  Enter an email address for the person you want to share with (or if they have a Mega account, you can select them from your contacts) and choose what access level they have to your files. Read-only access means a person can just download a file. Read-write means they can also add additional files to a folder. Full access means the person can make changes and delete content. Individual files can also be shared. Click on the link icon next to a file. You'll be given a number of share options, including a direct link. The link contains the encryption key in its URL. For that reason, Mega cautions security-conscious users from sharing those links in public. Still, Mega says it will never reveal user data tying a user to the file-specific key in a URL. This is what it looks like if you visit a link shared from Mega. You can download the file in the browser or if you are a Mega user, import the file directly into your own account. Free users have 50GB of storage. Additional capacities are available via resellers. Users can configure their access settings, including the number of parallel downloads and uploads, upload speed limits and the way identical files and SSL is handled. Users who want to upgrade to a Pro membership do so by purchasing a voucher from a reseller. The reseller provides users with a code which can be redeemed via account settings. Session history shows the IP address, browser and platform of the last 10 sessions with the service. Mega is going after Dropbox and other cloud services by offering tons of data for low prices. For $113 a year (USD), users can get 500GB of storage and 1TB of premium bandwidth. This is roughly 5 times what Dropbox offers for the same price. For now, Mega recommends users use Chrome over Firefox, Safari or Opera.  While upload and download features will work with other browsers, Chrome is the only browser to support JavaScript write access, which Mega uses for some of its functions. Mega — the long-anticipated file sharing and cloud storage site from Kim Dotcom — is now open to the public. Thanks to its association with the now-defunct Megaupload — and the legal issues facing its founder Kim Dotcom — the amount of press, user interest and hype surrounding Mega is greater than any file hosting/cloud storage launch in recent memory. SEE ALSO: An Appointment With Kim Dotcom According to Dotcom, more than 1 million users signed up for Mega in the first 24 hours. On Twitter, the larger-than-life entrepreneur has continued to share usage stats and traffic graphs that compare Mega with perennial cloud favorite, Dropbox. If you're curious about the inner workings of Mega, how it works and how it handles security, we've got you covered. Mega is the spiritual successor to Kim Dotcom's last business, the insanely popular file-hosting service Megaupload. Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice shut down Megaupload and pursued criminal charges against Dotcom. Dotcom, a New Zealand citizen, is actively fighting U.S. extradition orders. Megaupload was targeted by the DoJ because of its role in illegally distributing copyright material — including digital copies of movies, TV shows, books, music and software.  Rather than try to start a new service eschewing the potential for copyright material to be uploaded and shared, Dotcom is positioning Mega as a service that cares about and protects its user's privacy. In fact, Mega's tagline is ""the privacy company.""  On the surface, Mega is a bare-bones cloud storage host. After signing up for accounts, users can upload files and folders of all types to the service. Those files can then be shared with others. The free plan gives users 50GB of file storage. There are no hard limits on file size, meaning users can use Mega as a way to back up photos, documents and other data. Obviously, this means users can use Mega as a way to store media content — video files, music, DVD images — as well. For now, Mega is optimized to work on desktop web browsers. Mega strongly encourages users to use Google Chrome. And while Mega has big plans for developers and client-side apps, for now, the only way to access files is via the web browser. Files can be uploaded to the service using drag and drop or a file-upload menu. Users can create folders in the file manager. Uploads and downloads take place in parallel. If you upload a large number of files at once, each file uploads one at a time. In the future, Mega says users will be able to change the upload order. If you need to upload or download multiple files at once, simply open a new Mega tab in your browser and select that file. You can upgrade to a higher-tiered storage plan from within your account. Mega doesn't sell these plans itself; instead it has resellers who sell vouchers for a service. A 500GB storage plan with 1TB of enhanced bandwidth is 9.99 euros a month or 99 euros a year (a little over $110 U.S. dollars). That's cheaper than most of its competitors.  It's very important to remember the password you select when setting up your Mega account. The password is a big part of how Mega encrypts data on both ends. During the sign-up process, Mega uses your password to create a 2,048-bit RSA key. This is the key that tells the system you are who you say you are. If you forget your password, you're not going to be able to get into your account. Right now, Mega doesn't even have a password reset or recovery feature. In the future, Mega says it will have a reset mechanism but it will only allow users access to files or folders they have file keys for (more on file keys below). Users won't be able to access other files until or unless they remember their password. Because your Mega password is also your master encryption key, it's important that users choose a secure password. We recommend using a password manager and printing a copy of the password to store in a safe place.  Mega is focused on end-to-end encryption. This means that files are encrypted both on upload and on download. With most traditional file hosts or cloud storage lockers, a public link to a file also includes a file path. With Dropbox, for example, the public or shared link includes the file name. With Mega, things are a bit different. While users can share specific files to other Mega users or via email, the URL to a file doesn't contain a file name; instead, a cryptographic key is appended to the URL. Without this key, you can't access the file. Once decrypted by the server, a user has the option to download the linked file. Mega's promise, in other words, is that users control who has access to their files and accounts and no one else.  For important files or folders, users might want to make a note of the file key and keep it in a safe place — if they are worried about getting locked out of their account. Since Mega is touting itself as ""the privacy company,"" it's important to look at how the company stores files and content. The end-to-end encryption scheme is only part of how Mega secures data. Still, some are already criticizing the service, noting that it's not as secure as it says it is. An article for Forbes cites two professionals who have problems with Mega's security. Matthew Green, a cryptography professor at John Hopkins University, is particularly critical of the way Mega uses JavaScript to verify its encryption method telling Forbes that ""it makes no sense."" Mega has responded to Green's claims on its own blog, noting that its scheme ""basically enables us to host the extremely integrity-sensitive static content on a large number of geographically diverse servers without worrying about security."" Meanwhile, at Ars Technia Lee Hutchinson raises concerns about how Mega comes up with its crypto key at sign-up, as well as how the company handles deduplication, or how it eliminates duplicate copies of data. Again, Mega has taken to its blog to attempt to clarify its policies and the way it handles data. While Mega's crypto system certainly doesn't seem any less secure than any other file locker, we do agree with critics who note that the system might be more about giving Mega culpability against claims that it knows infringing content is on its servers, rather than about protecting that data itself. The service is still in beta and much of its code is available via open source, so security purists might want to watch how Mega's system evolves before trusting it with important, sensitive data. While security experts can quibble and argue over the way Mega uses cryptography and how it stores data on its array of servers, the bigger issue, for us, is long-term survival. While I would argue that most users who actively used Megaupload were not using it as a traditional cloud service, the fact remains that when the service was shut down, user files went with it.  Already anti-piracy groups are campaigning to shut down payment processors to Mega's resellers. One of the reasons Mega isn't taking payments itself and is instead using resellers is to prevent those groups from shutting down payment processors or trying to seize funds. This is worrisome because in addition to outside capital, Mega needs professional accounts to keep its site working. It's too early to say if Mega will be around for the long haul or not, but our advice is not to use Mega as your only file storage solution. Keep backups of crucial files on disk or other cloud-based services. What do you think of Mega? Let us know in the comments. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/microsoft-hires-andrew-kim/,Microsoft Hires Young Designer Whose Rebranding Project Went Viral,"Remember Andrew Kim, the young design student who proposed an extensive rebranding of Microsoft's many products and services? Well, Microsoft hired him. ""I'll be designing for Microsoft as of summer. I promise that I’ll make the my greatest work ever while I'm there,"" he wrote in a blog post.  Kim's ideas for a Microsoft rebranding were noticed by many when he posted his designs online last July. Interestingly, the software giant changed its logo just several months later, releasing a minimalist design similar to Kim's. By his own admission, Kim was approached by ""countless companies"" with offers after his Microsoft rebranding project went viral, but he eventually chose to go with Microsoft.  ""Working at a company is like getting married, it becomes a fundamental part of your life. I want to work with awesome people on awesome projects that I can get excited about. If you’ve been watching Microsoft over the past year, it’s been exciting, regardless of what your ecosystem preference is,"" he wrote.  Kim will be working in Microsoft's Xbox division, and we're excited to see how his design ideas will help shape a new visual identity for Xbox, which was left unchanged after the company's recent rebranding.

In a new book set to launch Tuesday, Joachim Kempim criticizes Microsoft, and says Ballmer is not the right person to lead the company. ""For Microsoft to really get back in the game seriously, you need a big change in management,"" Kempin told Reuters. ""As much as I respect Steve Ballmer, he may be a part of that in the end."" Before retiring in 2002, Kempin worked as the company's senior vice-president, overseeing worldwide OEM sales and marketing activities. He first joined Microsoft in 1983.  Entitled Resolve and Fortitude: Microsoft's ""secret power broker"" breaks his silence, Kempin's book details how the company botched its entry into tablets, phones and social media, according to Reuters. This mistake, he said, helped Apple and other competitors gain ground on Microsoft.  ""They missed all the opportunities they were talking about when I was still in the company."" Kempin also accused Ballmer of intentionally getting rid of executives who he saw as threats. Among them is former Windows chief Steven Sinofsky, whose sudden departure last November surprised many. In an op-ed, Mashable's Lance Ulanoff said, ""Maybe Ballmer thought Sinofsky was eclipsing him."" Kempin's call for a leadership change is similar to criticisms made by David Einhorn, founder of the Greenlight Capital hedge fund, in 2011.  ""Ballmer is stuck in the past and is, at best, a caretaker at Microsoft,"" Einhorn said at the time. Ballmer has been CEO of Microsoft since 2000. Image via Mashable "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/new-asteroid-mining-venture/,New Asteroid-Mining Venture Unveiled,"A new asteroid-mining company launched Tuesday with the goal of helping humanity expand across the solar system by tapping the vast riches of space rocks. The new firm, called Deep Space Industries, Inc., announced today (Jan. 22) that it plans to launch a fleet of prospecting spacecraft in 2015, then begin harvesting metals and water from near-Earth asteroids within a decade or so. Such work could make it possible to build and refuel spacecraft far above our planet's surface, thus helping our species get a foothold in the final frontier. ""Using resources harvested in space is the only way to afford permanent space development,"" Deep Space CEO David Gump said in a statement. Deep Space Industries will hold a press conference today in Santa Monica, Calif., at 10 a.m. PST (1 p.m. EST/1800 GMT) to unveil more details of its bold mission plan; you can watch the webcast live at SPACE.com.  ""More than 900 new asteroids that pass near Earth are discovered every year,"" Gump explained. ""They can be like the Iron Range of Minnesota was for the Detroit car industry last century — a key resource located near where it was needed. In this case, metals and fuel from asteroids can expand the in-space industries of this century. That is our strategy."" Deep Space is the second company to jump into the asteroid-mining business. The first, the billionaire-backed firm Planetary Resources, had its own unveiling last April. 







 Deep Space will inspect potential mining targets with 55-pound (25 kilograms) spacecraft it calls FireFlies, the first of which are targeted for launch in 2015. FireFlies will conduct asteroid reconnaissance on the cheap. They'll be made from low-cost ""cubesat"" components and will hitch a ride to space aboard rockets that also carry large communications satellites, Deep Space officials said. ""We can make amazing machines smaller, cheaper and faster than ever before,"" Deep Space chairman Rick Tumlinson said in a statement. ""Imagine a production line of FireFlies, cocked and loaded and ready to fly out to examine any object that gets near the Earth."" The FireFlies' work will pave the way for 70-pound (32 kg) spacecraft called DragonFlies, which will blast off beginning in 2016. DragonFlies will bring asteroid samples back to Earth during missions that last two to four years. Some samples will help the company determine mining targets, while others will probably be sold to researchers and collectors, officials said. The public will get to fly along with both probes, whose activities will likely be funded in some measure by corporate sponsorship, Deep Space officials said. ""The public will participate in FireFly and DragonFly missions via live feeds from Mission Control, online courses in asteroid mining sponsored by corporate marketers and other innovative ways to open the doors wide,"" Gump said. ""The Google Lunar X Prize, Unilever and Red Bull each are spending tens of millions of dollars on space sponsorships, so the opportunity to sponsor a FireFly expedition into deep space will be enticing."" These activities are all precursors to Deep Space's ultimate goal, which is the harvesting and in-space utilization of asteroid resources. The company intends to begin extracting metals and other building materials from space rocks within 10 years, officials said. These components will first be used to build communications satellites off-Earth, with the construction of space-based solar power stations coming later. Precious metals such as platinum will also be delivered to Earth for terrestrial use. Deep Space's construction activities will be aided by a patent-pending 3D printer called the MicroGravity Foundry, officials said. ""The MicroGravity Foundry is the first 3D printer that creates high-density, high-strength metal components even in zero gravity,"" company co-founder and MicroGravity Foundry inventor Stephen Covey said in a statement. ""Other metal 3D printers sinter powdered metal, which requires a gravity field and leaves a porous structure, or they use low-melting point metals with less strength."" Deep Space Industries will also focus on extracting asteroid water, which can be split into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen — the chief components of rocket fuel. The company's mining efforts could thus lead to the establishment of in-space ""gas stations"" that allow satellites and journeying spacecraft to top up their tanks relatively cheaply and efficiently. ""We will only be visitors in space until we learn how to live off the land there,"" Tumlinson said. ""This is the Deep Space mission — to find, harvest and process the resources of space to help save our civilization and support the expansion of humanity beyond the Earth — and doing so in a step-by-step manner that leverages off our space legacy to create an amazing and hopeful future for humanity."" Deep Space Industries' ambitions are similar to those of Planetary Resources, which also plans to tap asteroid metals and water to help open the solar system up to exploration and exploitation. Planetary Resources could prove to be a tough competitor. It was founded by private-spaceflight pioneers Peter Diamandis and Eric Anderson, and its deep-pocketed investors include Google execs Larry Page and Eric Schmidt.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/pbs-nova-drones-doc/,PBS' NOVA to Premiere Documentary on 'Rise of the Drones'," The robotic planes more commonly referred to as drones have gone from a secret, rarely covered military and CIA program to a regular fixture on the national media as well as technology websites.  As one of the leaders behind the U.S. drone program, White House adviser John Brennan, gets ready to face confirmation hearings to head the CIA, drones have never been more in the spotlight. Popular science show NOVA hopes to shed more light on these flying bots with a documentary titled ""Rise of the Drones.""  The documentary will tackle both the military and civilian side of drone technology, exploring how the military trains drone pilots at the Holloman Air Force base in New Mexico, as well as the role drones will play in domestic law enforcement.  There are controversies in both of these worlds. Are drone strikes in accordance with international law? Are they killing too many civilians? ""We’ve entered an era where we’re conducting an array of operations using unmanned systems that in a previous generation we would have called war, and we would have treated like war,"" Peter W. Singer, an expert in the future of warfare, says in the documentary. ""When you’re conducting more than 300 air strikes in a country, you’re conducting an equivalent of at least an ‘Air War’ campaign. But we don’t call it that now."" On the civilian side, most of the questions are related to privacy and security. Can citizens' privacy be respected when there are thousands of eyes in the sky? ""I think anybody that can use a device to peer into your activities even if it’s the air outside your window or the air above your property, I think there is a right to privacy,"" Rep. Rand Paul tells NOVA. ""The worry is that in two [to] three years we will have 30,000 drones crisscrossing the sky accumulating all this information."" SEE ALSO: Student Tweets Entire History of US Drone Strikes
 In addition to Singer and Paul, to try to answer all these questions NOVA interviewed the ""father"" of the Predator drone, the most widely used killer drone in the U.S. arsenal, several drone pilots and Vijay Kumar, a University of Pennsylvania roboticist, particularly known for his studies in the control and coordination of multi-robot formations. Check out the teaser trailer above to have an idea of what ""Rise of the Drones"" is all about.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/report-amazon-planning-zombieland-series/,Report: Amazon Planning 'Zombieland' Series,"Amazon is bolstering its fledgling lineup of original programming with a series based on the 2009 film Zombieland, according to a report. Broadcast Now reports that Amazon is developing a series based on the horror comic film, though it's unclear when it will be available via Amazon's Prime streaming service. Such a TV show has reportedly been in the works since late 2011. However, originally the show appeared to be headed to CBS. i09 also reports that a casting call just went out for the show, so it wil likely be some time until it is available for viewing. Last June, Amazon announced a slate of original programming for Prime, including a handful of comedies and a children's program. The comedies include an animated show about Hell, a ""mockumentary"" about the end of the world and another series about a magician's helpers turned arch-rivals. The children's show features a sheep named Buck with a penchant for high-speed driving. Amazon vies with others in the streaming video space, including Netflix and Hulu, that are developing their own original program. Netflx's next big move in this arena is season 4 of Arrested Development, which is expected to hit later this year. Hulu, meanwhile, is planning to release The Awesomes, an animated series featuring Saturday Night Live's Kenan Thompson, Bill Hader, and Taran Killam.  Image courtesy of YouTube "

The case, which is made by Griffin, can be yours for just $14.99 on the company’s website. The company also sells an owl and a hippo version. The case is only made for the iPod touch — so while it may have appeared the tween was sporting a smartphone, it looks like that’s a privilege still only held by her older sister Malia.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/secret-service-bionic-ears/,Secret Service Mulls Bionic Ears to Detect Gunfire at Large Events,"The Secret Service is shopping for camouflaged sensors that can decipher gunshot details amid city hubbub, contracting documents suggest. The agency, responsible for guarding inaugurations and other U.S. special events, would exercise sole control over the surveillance system, rather than let private analysts send assessments, as many cities are starting to do. ""Due to the secure nature of these sites, a high gunshot detection rate (more than 95%) is strongly desired while daily, operational monitoring of the system by external parties is undesirable,” stated a Jan. 18 survey form for contractors who have products ready to sell. As prices drop, and geospatial tracking and sound monitoring sharpen, police are embracing gunfire identification technologies. Cities nationwide, including Chicago, Kansas City, Mo., and Palo Alto, Calif., have leased gun detection services online, through the cloud, from security vendor ShotSpotter. It is unclear whether the Secret Service's system would be stationed in specific locales or moved for each event.   Agency officials said they want ""technologies for fixed site surveillance applications,"" covering from ""10s to 100s of acres per site, located within urban areas."" But the questionnaire also inquires, ""Is the system portable (i.e., can it be quickly relocated to another site)?"" Special event safety increasingly relies on a variety of high-tech monitors, such as city traffic cameras for presidential debates and facial recognition tools for the Super Bowl. Secret Service officials are asking retailers whether their gunfire sensors can be ""integrated to communicate with other detection systems."" A deep data dive on each incident apparently appeals to the agency. Officials want to know whether gunfire reports are able to detail, for instance, the caliber of the weapon, route the bullet took, elevation of the shot and projectile velocity of the ammunition. One challenge with shot detection is that the location of the shooter – be it hidden inside a car or in a wind tunnel — can mask blasts. Potential vendors are asked to disclose factors that might impair a system’s perception. And they must address the technology’s ability to parse certain tricky situations such as, multiple shots occurring in a short time interval, from the same or different locations. The Secret Service is pursuing technologies that are ""easily concealed"" or could ""aesthetically match their surroundings,"" according to the survey sheet. Shot detectors have sparked privacy concerns because they can pick up ambient noise, like a loud street argument that accompanied a fatal shooting in New Bedford, Mass., according to The New York Times. ShotSpotter officials told The Times that concerns about privacy are generally unfounded since the detectors ""don’t turn on unless they hear a gunshot.""  Authorities can obtain critical tips about what to expect upon arriving at a crime scene and potential evidence — such as how fast and in what direction a shooter in a car was traveling, the report added.

It was recently announced that a new game inspired by the SimCity virtual reality game is coming to the classroom. Teachers will be able to upload educational content to the game that requires players to build virtual cities.   Launching this March, SimCityEDU was developed by a partnership between game-maker Electronic Arts, Inc.

In fact, according to new Nielsen data, you're 52% more likely to own a tablet. Although the findings — which were released on Tuesday in Nielsen's 2012 Year in Sports report — aren't entirely surprising, it further confirms what we already knew: sports fans are highly connected to tech and digital world.  In fact, about 60% of tablet and smartphone owners who use mobile devices for sports content do so at least once a day.  Sports fans in general are also more likely to have other tech-related tools and gadgets than their non-sporty counterparts, from DVR for taping games (42%) and gaming consoles (33%) to smartphones (21%) and HDTV (20%).  Yes, sports fans love to go on Twitter to discuss news and games in real time, but perhaps one of the most fascinating discoveries revealed in the data is that more than 40% of all TV-related tweets are about sports, even though it only makes up 1.3% of TV programming.  ""Live sports are all about real-time action, and mobile devices allow sports fans to keep up and discuss that action, while also providing instant access to the sports content they want — whether that's score updates, fantasy stats or tweets to their favorite athlete,"" Stephen Master, senior VP of sports for Nielsen, told Mashable. ""Smartphones and tablets haven't quite changed the live sports viewing experience yet — TV is still the top platform — but our research shows that more and more people are frequently using these devices while watching TV, indicating that these devices are enhancing that viewing experience."" Sports-related apps are also highly visited by fans. The top sports apps based on average monthly time spent by each user are as follows: ESPN Streak for the Cash (No. 1), Yahoo!

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/suface-pro-availability/,Microsoft Surface Pro Goes on Sale Feb. 9,"The Surface Pro -- the version of the Surface tablet that runs full Windows 8 Pro -- will hit store shelves Feb. 9. It packs an Intel Core i5 processor and is thicker and heavier than the Surface RT. It'll come in two capacities: 64GB and 128GB, for $899 and $999, respectively. Like it's RT brother, the Surface Pro also sports a kickstand. The Surface Pro comes packaged with a stylus -- or digital pen -- for precision work. The Pro has a cooling vent built into the backside of the enclosure, expelling air from all sides of the device. Touch Covers are optional for the Surface Pro. The Surface Pro's pen is designed to specifically work with the tablet. Microsoft made a version of its Wedge Touch mouse that cosmetically matches the Surface. It costs $70. The Surface's famous Touch Cover will get three new designs on Feb. 9, too. If you liked the Microsoft Surface RT tablet but wished you could run classic Windows apps on it, you won't have to wait much longer. The Surface Pro — the more powerful version of the tablet that runs full Windows 8 Pro — will be on store shelves Feb. 9. The initial availability of the Surface Pro, explained in a blog post, will be limited to the U.S. and Canada. As Microsoft had previously announced, it'll come in two capacities: 64GB ($899) and 128GB ($999). The famous magnetic Touch Cover keyboard is a $120 option for the Pro tablet, although a specialized stylus is included. The Surface Pro is also getting a couple of special accessories. Since the Pro is more of a productivity device than the RT version, users will likely want to pair it with a separate keyboard and mouse, and Microsoft will offer a special version of its Wedge Touch Mouse, cosmetically designed specifically to match the Surface, for $69.95. There will also be three ""limited edition"" Touch Cover designs for $129.99 each. SEE ALSO: Microsoft Reveals Surface With Windows 8 Pro Price and Specs
 Microsoft will stop forcing the Touch Cover on some Surface RT buyers, too. As of Feb. 9, the 64GB version of the Surface RT will be available without one for $599. Previously Microsoft only offered that model with the cover. Finally, Microsoft says it will be expanding the number of markets the Surface RT is available to more than double. Currently the tablet is available only in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, China, France, Germany, and Hong Kong. We got a little hands-on time with the Surface Pro while we were at CES. While the tablet is noticeably heavier than the Surface RT (by half a pound), it struck us as a logical choice for a specific use case: The tablet resides in a workstation most of the time but is easily detached for taking home or into meetings. Battery life, which is rated at half of the Surface RT's approximately 8 hours, could be a concern, though. Will you be lining up for a Surface Pro? Let us know why or why not in the comments.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/technology-edelman-trust-barometer/,Technology Ranks World's Most-Trusted Industry in 2013,"The technology industry has been ranked most-trusted for the seventh consecutive year, ahead of the automotive, and food and beverage industries, according to the 2013 Edelman Trust Barometer. ""As an industry, I think tech companies pre-anticipate and solve problems for consumers,"" Ben Boyd, Edelman's corporate global practice chairman, told Mashable. ""I also think in today's world where technology is connecting people, it's the companies that get credit for making it happen. It really creates a halo effect for the industry itself."" The findings of the Trust Barometer, an annual survey of 31,000 people in 26 countries evaluating trust in leaders, institutions and industries, were released Monday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Edelman's primary takeaway from the study of people in 26 countries was an overwhelming distrust in leadership compared to institutions. The 20-minute online survey was conducted between Oct. 16 and Nov. 29, 2012 by research firm Edelman Berland. The survey was completed by 26,000 general population responders and an oversample of 5,800 informed publics (college educated, high earners who regularly watch the news).  Among respondents, 77% say they trust technology companies, which is down from 79% in 2012. Boyd warns that the tech industry will face more scrutiny should larger data breeches occur.  ""It's a double edged sword: As technology enables more data capture and data dissemination, data concerns are going to rise,"" Boyd says. ""For the tech industry, that's how do we continue to deliver value while not compromising things customers' value.""  The least trusted industries are media, banks and financial services, which have been embroiled in major recent controversies. The second-ranked automotive industry, Boyd notes, has regained trust after its late-2000s crisis. Though media institutions, are more trusted in 2013 than they were last year, they still rank less-trusted below NGOs and businesses. This year, 57% of people surveyed trust media, ahead of government institutions (48% trusted), but behind NGOs (63% trusted) and businesses (58% trusted). Boyd says that distrust in the media industry comes from scandals in recent memory. ""When you think about the BBC scandal, or you think about News Corp., I think the distrust creeps from one enterprise across an industry,"" he says. There is a considerable gap between emerging and developed markets' trust in the media industry. Among respondents in emerging markets, 71% trust information found through online search engines, 65% trust traditional media outlets and 58% trust social media. In contrast, just 47% of respondents in developed markets trust online search engines and a mere 26% trust social media. ""In the west we're very computer dependent and I think those emerging markets are so much more mobile savvy as far as the way they consume media,"" Boyd says. ""In those emerging markets you're starting to see info share more quickly and they know it's less controlled by state government than traditional media is.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/the-dream-is-now/,Steve Jobs' Widow Launches Immigration Reform Web Project,"Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of the late Apple founder Steve Jobs, has long been advocating for immigration reform and the passage of the DREAM Act, which would give undocumented young people a path to American citizenship. Now the wealthiest woman in Silicon Valley has partnered with award-winning documentary filmmaker Davis Guggenheim to launch The Dream Is Now, a video-based web project to bring attention to the stories of undocumented youth. The Dream Is Now invites undocumented young people to record and post video messages about the ways their situation might change if the DREAM Act were passed. Others who might support the bill, including educators and lawmakers, are also welcome to post video messages of support on the site. Guggenheim will eventually collect footage from the site and combine it into a documentary on the DREAM Act. ""There needed to be a demystification — to put a face to these people, to hear the individual stories,"" Powell Jobs told Yahoo News. The most prominently featured video at launch time includes footage of undocumented youths announcing their immigration status to the world. Their last names have been withheld likely to protect their privacy. ""Today, I am going to take a really big step in my life and I'm going to step out of the shadows and into the public sphere to be part of a larger movement, to be part of a greater cause,"" says Osmar, an undocumented young man from San Diego, Calif. ""I have a secret that I'm very hesitant to share,"" says Cendy, from Aurora, Colo. More personal videos can be viewed below the home page's main player. The site also includes a petition which supporters of the DREAM Act can sign. Supporters are also asked to tweet or post to Instagram about the campaign using the hashtag #TheDreamIsNow. Visit The Dream Is Now. SEE ALSO: New Bill Welcomes High-Tech Entrepreneurs to the U.S.
 The DREAM Act, first introduced in 2001, would legalize undocumented residents who arrived in the U.S. as minors and have lived in the country for at least five years. Applicants who keep a clean criminal record and attend college or serve in the military would be granted a path to American citizenship. The DREAM Act has bipartisan support but has never passed, coming closest to doing so in December of 2010. The timing for The Dream Is Now is no accident: President Barack Obama has said that immigration reform will be among his top priorities during his second term, which began Sunday.

During his time in office thus far, Obama's managed to handle the spotlight pretty well. He's had a few shots of his bad side, but managed to mask any bad hair days, keep those pearly whites camera-ready and knows what light he looks best in.  And smizing? Please!

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/the-onion-diamond-joe-biden/,Is The Onion's 'Diamond' Joe Biden Anything Like Our Real Veep?,"Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference between Joe Biden, the vice president of the United States, and ""Diamond"" Joe Biden, his doppelganger on The Onion.  One instance was Monday, when the real VP was running zigzags down the inaugural-parade route, gesturing toward the crowd as though he was the star of the show. They are both larger-than-life characters, and there are times when headlines about one could be written about the other. For instance:  Real Joe Biden: Hangs out with bikers at a campaign stop and nuzzles one on the head. Onion ""Diamond"" Joe Biden: Asks White House visitor if he wants to ""check out the roof."" Real Joe Biden: Flirts with senators' mothers during swearing-in. Swears in a baby. Onion ""Diamond"" Joe Biden: Washes Trans Am in White House driveway, shirtless. ""He's one part 1980s high school dirtbag, one part your disgusting uncle, and there's a part of him that has a natural charm,” says Chad Nackers, an Onion writer who has been on the Biden beat for five years and a lead writer on a new Biden ""autobiography"" released last week.  In another breath, he described Biden as being akin to those rebel teenagers who stand outside high schools smoking cigarettes. You know, ""those kids out there with their Pantera shirts talking about metal concerts."" In reality, that description doesn't make any sense at all. The vice president is a straight edge: He never drinks, he's a devout Catholic and he is very much a family man. He likes folk music, for heaven's sake. But on The Onion, Biden has become a swashbuckling, ponytail-wearing dirty uncle, someone who slacks off from work, ""ignoring his responsibilities, cruising for chicks."" It's not just The Onion; the vice president has proven to be a political character with an uncanny Internet appeal. For instance, when he used a funny word at the VP debate, malarkey, we got this. White House petitioners have even called for a Biden reality show.  But you wonder at times if the vice president is also aware of his pull on the web. For instance, is he aware that when he goes to Costco, the pictures of him shopping around the store will go viral? Especially seeing how that November trip to the wholesaler was used as a platform to discuss middle-class taxes (not to mention a possible kickback to Costco cofounder Jim Sinegal, a longtime Democratic supporter who spoke at last year's Democratic National Convention). The Onion version of Joe Biden is a character who both wildly diverges from, yet reflects, the real living vice president. Their writers take the Biden who hangs out with bikers, but they make him a drunk. They take the Biden who swoons women and have him make out with Janna Ryan after the VP debate.  ""I'm sure Joe Biden would deny most of our coverage,"" Nackers says. But he seems to like it. Last January, Biden told Yahoo News that he thought the spoofs were ""hilarious."" Then, on Friday, while the fake Joe was taking questions on Reddit, the real VP sent this tweet insulting the former's taste in cars: Q for @reddit AMA with my @theonion pal: A Trans-Am? Ever look under the hood of a Corvette? #imavetteguy –VP twitter.com/VP/status/2923… — Office of VP Biden (@VP) January 18, 2013 The Onion's new e-book, The President of Vice, follows the tale of the dirty-uncle Biden, the one who, in that glorious summer of 1987, had a ""mystical experience"" in the New Mexico desert.  ""I think it's brought on by sniffing Oxycontin or something,"" Nackers says. ""But the whole time he's talking about this perfect time that he could light up a joint in front of a cop and that cop can either ask for a hit off of it or throw him in the clink for the night, and then he'd make some awesome friends while he was in jail. No matter what, it was all kind of smooth sailing for him."" With section titles such as ""Places I've Gotten Down and Dirty in D.C.,"" there aren't many passages in the book that are safe for work. Here's ""Diamond"" Joe talking about his congressional legacy: OK, now here's the achievement that I was most proud of and will be the centerpiece of my legacy. It was in that Summer of '87 that I became the first member of Congress to break the 3-minute barrier for keg stands. That's enuf said.… Let's just say I blew Strom Thurmond's 2 minutes and 15 seconds out of the water. We asked Nackers how The Onion conceives of such adventures. It's not exactly scientific. Here's his description of the pitch meeting when the shirtless Trans Am idea came up.  ""I think originally there was a headline that was pitched that was a little more intense, like he was hammered or something, and crashed his car,"" he says. ""And we were thinking there’s more of a story to be told if he's hanging out. And a lot of times that's how an idea is pitched, and then it transforms into something else."" That story transformed further when the publication set out to find a body double for the veep, ""on Craigslist or something,"" and lucked out to find a white Trans Am owner who also ""was quite like Joe Biden in a way."" Perhaps the publication’s affinity for Biden echoes its own editorial roots. The classic Onion story is a spoof on the ""local man"" story that you might see in the pages of a small-circulation paper. Such as ""Area Man Winded After Particularly Lengthy Wendy's Order."" Biden's that guy to them, but in Washington. ""He's like the real guy in Washington,"" Nackers says. ""A lot of politicians hide that, they're kind of glossy and they're all about reaching out to their constituents or whoever, or climbing up that D.C. ladder, and Joe is just a real guy.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/the-second-space-race-its-on/,The Second Space Race: It's On,"Fans of Joss Whedon's cult TV sci-fi hit Firefly will be glad to know the show lives on — as the name for a new kind of one-way exploratory vehicle launching in 2015.  That's if the newest space startup, Deep Space Industries, gets the commercial sponsorship it is seeking. A scrappy collection of NASA veterans, entrepreneurs, aerospace and mining consultants, with as-yet unknown sources of funding, DSI seems to embody much of the spirit of Firefly.  Like the motley crew of the good ship Serenity, this asteroid mining company is talking a bigger game than it currently has. It's running an angle on the best intersteller plunder available, while trying not be outfoxed by its wealthier competitors. Shiny.   The company launched Tuesday as a direct competitor to Planetary Resources, which was up until now the only company on the planet seeking to mine those $20 trillion-dollar rocks flying around far above our heads.  Planetary Resources has an impressive roster of billionaires (such as Larry Page and Eric Schmidt) backing it, and some lofty plans. But DSI may have gone it one better in the budget and innovation departments.  It plans to send inexpensive CubeSats on one-way missions of up to six months. They will prospect for the richest asteroids up close, rather than send up space telescopes to scan them from afar, which is Planetary Resources' goal. The new startup also says it has a patent on a space foundry, a 3-D printer that can use asteroid metals and minerals as its raw materials. ""The MicroGravity Foundry is the first 3D printer that creates high-density, high-strength metal components even in zero gravity,"" DSI co-founder Stephen Covey said in a statement. If you need a primer on near-Earth asteroids, or how easy much easier it is to grab one of these near-Earth rocks than to go to the Moon, read this story. Or check out DSI's fantastically overproduced CGI movie trailer of a promotional video:  The launch came just two days after Planetary Resources issued a rather more down-to-Earth vid, in which it boasted that it was under contract to NASA to produce its asteroid-finding space telescope, the Arkyd-100:  Competing companies. Competing business models. Trillion-dollar resource goals. And just like that, ladies and gentlemen, the second space race is on.  The first space race, between the USSR and the USA, was primarily political. It was Cold War rivals flexing their exploratory muscles. The only reward was worldwide kudos and bragging rights to the Moon.  This one will be primarily economic, and the potential rewards are incalculable.  Neither DSI nor Planetary Resources are the first companies to be founded around the goal of asteroid mining. But they are the first companies to compete for it. That sound you heard is Adam Smith's invisible hand of the market reaching into Near Earth orbit. Just as in the first space race, there's no guarantee either side will succeed. Space itself may present insurmountable challenges, not least of which (now as in the 1960s) is funding. But DSI's CubeSat-based proposal seems to do everything it can to get over the funding hurdle.  The whole idea of CubeSats is that they can hitch a ride on any space-bound rocket for a nominal fee; it's the province of university engineering departments the world over. Six nations successfully launched the new class of micro-satellites for the first time in 2003.  There have been dozens of similar launches since then, most recently in October. The first Kickstarter-funded Cubesat, ArduSat, is set to be launched this July. (The project asked for $35,000 in funding, and got more than $100,000.) Planetary Resources has tentative plans to launch its first Arkyd in 2014. The pictures that produces should spur more interest and investment. If DSI launches the next year as planned, marking the first time a private company has sent a mission to an asteroid, that should goose interest still further — and both companies will find it easier to go on to their respective next stages, gathering samples from promising-looking rocks.  This is the most important way in which the second space race differs: if one of these companies wins in any way, they both do — as do more potential competitors. A rising tide lifts all asteroid miners. ""There are 2 to 3 million near-Earth asteroids,"" DSI CEO David Gump pointed out. ""There's room for everyone to prosper."" He estimated that each ton of asteroid minerals would be worth $1 million in orbit. At that rate, it wouldn't take much for DSI to become wealthier than the wildest imaginings of the Serenity crew.

The mobile communicators of the modern age have found all sorts of creative uses for the iPhone's Unicode pictographs, but there are a couple more inventive applications for Emoji that you might not know about. We've got the scoop on three unexpected uses for Emoji that'll make your iPhone a more fun — and organized — place to be. 1. Contacts — Add appropriate Emoji based on your favorite people's interests. It adds personality, and it's a good memory-triggering device, too. Met a fellow skier at a party? Stick her number in your phone with little skis. Emoji is also a good way to find groups of friends. Add a little cocktail emoticon by all of your girlfriends. When you want to go out on Friday night, search for the cocktail in ""All Contacts,"" and there they are. 2. App Folders — Instead of having random apps strewn about your phone, you can organize them into ""folders,"" which are essentially collections of similar applications. But some category names, like Photography, are long and clutter the home screen. Using a camera emoticon instead keeps home-screen chaos down to a minimum. 3. Alarms — Trouble waking up, sleepyhead? Maybe a sunshine Emoji will inspire you. Try it for doctor or dentist appointments and as weather reminders when the forecast predicts rain or snow.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/22/urban-gardens-across-america/,Crowdfunding for 100 Urban Gardens Across America,"Whole Kids Foundation, PACT and Indiegogo have joined forces to create an inspiring crowdfunding initiative: building 100 urban gardens across the United States. This is the first time a non-profit, a brand and a global crowdfunding platform have partnered to help drive change in local communities around the country. Whole Foods' non-profit arm will facilitate each grant and provide online resources, while PACT, an organic apparel company supporting global causes, will provide physical perks in exchange for donations. Indiegogo will provide the platform through which donations can be made until Feb. 28. SEE ALSO: A Look Back at Indiegogo's Successful Year in Crowdfunding
 The main goal of the partnership is to increase accessibility and consumption of fresh produce in local communities through sustainable gardening. The initiative also aims to inspire community members to become activists and raise money through crowdfunding. The idea isn't just to build gardens, but also to equip community members with a working knowledge of gardening in order to sustain them. ""[This is] awesome, because it's not just a non-profit spending its own dollars to fund gardens as an attempt to educate the country of the importance of healthy eating,"" Danae Ringelmann, co-founder of Indiegogo, told Mashable. ""It's a non-profit foundation — Whole Kids — partnering with PACT and Indiegogo to unleash action and inspire supporters not just to fund gardens, but actually raise money for their own local gardens."" Whole Kids Foundation and PACT reached out to their networks and organized 78 people across the country wanting to take action and take the lead. Over the course of the Urban Gardens Across America initiative, these activists — dubbed ""PACTivists"" — will run campaigns side-by-side, raising $2,500 for each garden. All of the local garden campaigns are housed on a partnership page on Indiegogo. ""So, if you're someone who is living in New York City, but you're from Wichita, you can go on and fund the garden in Wichita and the garden in New York,"" Ringelmann said. ""Or, if you have a sister who has a husband and kids living in San Francisco, you can go on and fund the garden for them as well.""  As the non-profit arm of a major brand, Whole Kids Foundation probably could have funded the gardens itself, but Ringelmann explained that partnering with PACT and Indiegogo, and educating community members, is far more sustainable, and also helps large brands engage customers on a local level. ""You know the saying: 'Give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day; teach a man to fish and he eats for life.' We're going a step further and we're empowering people to teach their own communities how to 'fish' so their whole communities will be self-sustaining and will be able to eat for life,"" she said. Whole Kids Foundation launched a similar initiative, its school garden grant program, in 2011, receiving 3,000 applications for $2,000 grants. The non-profit was able to fund 1,000 of those applications. ""The need for support and opportunity to connect kids to the roots of food became clear to us,"" Nona Evans, president and executive director of Whole Kids Foundation, told Mashable. ""And we have, in partnership with FoodCorps, continued to fund school gardens in the U.S., Canada and the U.K."" While Whole Kids Foundation works with experts in many fields, the Urban Gardens Across America campaign is the non-profit's first experience with crowdfunding. ""When we discovered that together our work and passion could support dozens of gardens for deserving schools and community organizations, we knew we had an invaluable partnership. Clearly both PACT and Indiegogo are leaders in their fields,"" Evans said. The gardens will be built after the campaigns are complete, and the unique partnership between the three entities will help move each campaign toward its goal through motivation, collaboration and empowerment. ""I just think it's really exciting that we're coming together,"" Ringelmann said. ""We're changing cause marketing, we're changing non-profit fundraising and we're showing how a foundation, a brand and a crowdfunding platform can work together to make change and empower the country to make its own change.""

Verizon revealed during its earnings call Tuesday that it activated 6.2 million iPhones in the fourth quarter, almost half of which were LTE-enabled iPhone 5 devices. That means Verizon sold about 3 million iPhone 5s in the December quarter, up from 651,000 in the previous quarter (when the device had only been on sale for nine days). In total, the carrier activated 9.8 million smartphones in the fourth quarter, a new record for quarterly smartphone activations. In a pre-earnings estimate earlier this month, Verizon credited the higher number of activations to a ""higher mix of Apple smartphones."" Despite the record number of activations, Verizon reported a whopping $1.93 billion loss for the fourth quarter due to charges incurred from pensions and Hurricane Sandy.  AT&T and Sprint haven't reported their iPhone sales figures yet, though AT&T did reveal that it too had a record quarter for smartphone sales — with 10 million smartphone activations — which many assume is due to demand for the new iPhone. Apple's earnings report for the December quarter will be released on Wednesday. Apple's stock was up by about half a percent pre-market following the positive iPhone sales figures.

The show features some gaming elements, which makes sense. Machinima, a video entertainment network for gamers that collectively has nearly 4 billion (with a ""b"") video views, produces Bite Me. THNKR is not exactly a show; it's a channel that produces four shows -- Bookd, Prodigies, Podium and Epiphany -- all of which are absolutely brilliant. These are the types of videos you can't stop watching. They're inspiring, thought-provoking and extremely well-produced. Krogzilla, a mild-mannered monster, was recently downsized. As a result, he lost his job as a city destroyer. This emotionally riveting 10-part series chronicles his quest to find a new career.  Similar to MTV Cribs, OffBeat Spaces is less ""lifestyles of the rich and famous"" and more lifestyles of the quirky and interesting. The most recent episode features Carleen Farabaugh, who lives in a house in Pennsylvania shaped like a shoe. Whether you're religious or not, this show will hook you from the very first second. You won't believe the show's host, Andy Zohoury, is not a professional. He will mesmerize you with his deep, mellifluous voice and continuous stream of poetic philosophizing -- loaded with esoteric facts. Zohoury, a medical student, has been producing the show in his free time since 2009.  At the end of the first episode, he states his goal for the program: ""If god is both the first-hand author of the universe and second-hand author of the scriptures, it is my hope in investigation of the two to provide an accurate and unbiased way to perceive reality, regardless of one's sense of spirituality or religious affiliation."" Media company MyMusic made a satirical mockumentary about itself. The show is an allegory in which ""Indie,"" the snobbish hipster boss, tries to manage a crack squad crew that includes ""Metal,"" ""Dubstep,"" ""Scene,"" ""Intern 2"" and more. There's not much to the plot, but After Hours features the kind of witty back-and-forth dialogue the characters on The Newsroom wish they could pull off.  In this episode, the gang answers ""life's most important question:"" Which Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle are you? They eventually come to the realization that the four turtles, along with many other TV and movie quartets, resemble the Hippocratic four humors.  Doc Talk is a meta-documentary series with more than 100 episodes to date. The episodes are usually less than six minutes long and feature interviews with documentary producers. It's a great way to decide whether or not to check out a documentary you had considered watching. Members of the human race sheepishly inject themselves with computers. The computers get a virus. Things get dramatic, very dramatic. If you like your technological, dsytopian drama in five-minute bursts, this is the show for you. YouTube probably isn't your number-one option when you're looking for an entertaining series. With the amount of professionally produced content available on Netflix and Hulu+, it doesn't make sense to pour through YouTube's seemingly endless archives in search of something resembling a TV show. And anyway, even if there are great indie shows out there somewhere, YouTube doesn't offer a really intuitive way to find them. Well, save the hugs for later — we did it for you.

The house, pictured below, will resemble an ever-looping Mobius strip, allowing landscape to ""flow through and under the house,"" he says.  The Los Angeles Times reports that Ruijssenaars will use what's called a D-Shape printer. The machine combines thin layers of sand with a bonding agent to create a material similar to marble. The house, then, will be printed in chunks — about 20 feet by 30 feet — and be constructed from the ground up.  SEE ALSO: Print Your Own 3D-Printed Robot
 And the project won't come cheap. The BBC reports the house will cost between $5 million and $6 million to build. Ruijssenaars plans to have it finished by 2014.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/3d-printed-clothing-paris/,3D-Printed Clothing Hits Paris Fashion Week,"We’ve seen a few instances over the years of high technology colliding with high fashion, but maybe never in a way as direct and striking as this. 3D printing has come to the world of fashion, and the latest example of this collaboration is the Voltage collection, which is currently on display at Paris Fashion Week.  Three-dimensional printing refers to a very new way of creating goods – a model is designed using a CAD program, which is then sent to a 3D printer. There are tons of different 3D printers out there, all of which can use certain materials to build the desired product, layer by layer. Usually, the material in question is something hard, like plastics or metals, but lately the range of materials has been expanded to include softer materials like rubber and polyurethane. It’s that latter development that has made 3D-printed fashion a possibility. The Voltage collection is an 11-piece set from designer Iris van Herpen, 3D printer manufacturer Stratasys and Materialise, which brands themselves as a software company dedicated toward working with additive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing refers to the fact that 3D-printed objects are made from the ground up, layer by layer, as opposed to traditional fashion being cut from a larger piece of cloth, or a sculpture being created by chipping away pieces of marble or metal (subtractive processes).  The collection features a wide array of apparel, including a combination skirt and cape and a form-fitting dress. This was a collaborative design with Julia Koerner, who is an architect and a UCLA professor. Both of those articles feature both hard and soft materials, and it sounds like that’s going to open up some new avenues in fashion.  ""The ability to vary softness and elasticity inspired us to design a 'second skin' for the body acting as armor-in-motion,"" says Co-designer, Neri Oxman. ""In this way we were able to design not only the garment’s form but also its motion.""  Oxman was largely responsible for the Imaginary Beings collection, a host of 3D-printed articles based on mythology that debuted last year. This year's Voltage collection aims to be a little more practical, producing articles that could actually be worn in daily life. Photos courtesy of Stratasys Ltd/PR Newswire

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/500px-removed-app-store/,500px Removal Highlights App Store Inequalities,"The removal of 500px from Apple's App Store raises questions over review equity, fairness and API functionality. When Evgeny Tchebotarev started the day, he wasn't expecting to end up spending so much time fielding calls from the media. Tchebotarev is the COO and co-founder of 500px, a popular photo site and community for professional and amateur photographers. Yet that's exactly what happened after Apple removed the 500px app from the App Store. After more than 16 months in the App Store and over 1 million downloads, a routine app update had unintended consequences. On Monday night, Tchebotarev tells Mashable that he received a call from Apple. There was a problem with 500px. Like many other apps with photo communities, including Tumblr and Flickr, some of the photographers who use 500px use it to take photographs that contain nudity — not pornographic images, but nudity nonetheless. According to Tchebotarev, Apple reps told him that it was too easy for users to find nude photos using the app. As a result, the app was in violation of Apple's content policy and would be removed from the App Store. Tchebotarev offered to make the necessary changes to the app to comply with Apple's rules, but it was too late. As of Tuesday morning, 500px was gone from the App Store.  A few hours later, TechCrunch reported on the story. Other outlets followed, including CNET, MacRumors and The Verge. Soon, the story was viral. The general reaction from both 500px employees and app users was disbelief. For one thing, 500px actually makes it difficult for new users to browse or search for nude photos. A user who signs up using the app can't see those types of photos; instead, he or she must log in through their desktop, and turn off a safe-search setting. For another, 500px is hardly the only app that could potentially expose users to nude images. Web browsers — including Apple's Safari — can display nude photos of all types. Plus, the aforementioned Tumblr and Flickr apps are much easier to use to track down nudes. To add insult to injury, while 500px is gone, a dozen apps that use 500px's API and replicate the functionality of the official app are still available.  Then, Apple released its own statement on the matter. It said: ""The app was removed from the App Store for featuring pornographic images and material, a clear violation of our guidelines. We also received customer complaints about possible child pornography. We've asked the developer to put safeguards in place to prevent pornographic images and material in their app.""
 This statement was confusing to Tchebotarev and other 500px execs because it was the first any of them had heard about complaints regarding ""possible child pornography."" Apple never mentioned that to the company before pulling the app, Tchebotarev said.  He added that 500px has made the necessary changes to its app, and re-submitted to the App Store. With any luck, the app will be back in the store very soon. Normally, this is where the news story would end. But what the 500px incident showcases, however, is that although more than four years have passed since the App Store opened, Apple's app-review process is still occasionally hampered by incongruities and unclear policies. My initial guess was that 500px was removed for not having the correct content rating. Apple assigns content ratings to apps to give users an idea of who the app is suitable for. A rating of 4+ means that there is no objectionable content in the app; a 9+ means there might be cartoon violence; a 12+ means there may be infrequent or mild sexual content/nudity and mild violence; and a 17+ means the app may contain heavy violence and mature themes. These content ratings can be arbitrary at best. Tumblr has a rating of 4+ despite the fact that it's very easy to find hardcore pornographic images using the tag search function within the app. Third-party web browsers such as Chrome and iCab have 17+ ratings because they can be used to access any site on the Internet (assuming it doesn't use Flash). Before Monday's incident, 500px had a content rating of 4+. Tchebotarev told me that the copy of the app in the submission queue has a rating of 12+. Based on feedback he's heard from other developers, Tchebotarev's theory is that Apple's review team (a team that is notoriously overworked) doesn't always check to ensure that apps have the proper content rating. Instead, it takes a series of complaints or a particularly conscientious review-team member to force an app to change its rating. This makes sense to me. Still, I'm utterly unsure how Tumblr, of all apps, has managed to avoid even a 12+ rating.  Another issue raised with the 500px case is the role of an API within the app-review process. Apple initially said it was going to pull Pulpfingers' ISO500 app from the App Store. 500px acquired Pulpfingers (and ISO500, by extension) last month. As of this writing, ISO500 is still in the App Store, and doesn't appear to have been pulled.  It wasn't clear why ISO500 was going to be removed, but some pundits worried that it was because the app uses 500px's API. The API allows read-access to the site and search, including, presumably, access to nude photos. This opens up an interesting question when it comes to third-party apps that use 500px's API, such as Flipboard. Flipboard can do virtually everything the official 500px and the ISO500 apps can do (at least, as far as displaying content), so would it be at risk? Right now, that seems unlikely, but it does raise some interesting questions that few of us have considered over the years: Is an app that plugs into another app's API going to be rated based on the functionality of that API?  It's unclear. At the time of this writing, 500px is still missing from the App Store. While I fully expect the app to appear within the next day or two, I can't help but feel empathy for the startup caught in the middle of this.  What do you think of the latest App Store hijinx? Let us know in the comments below. "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/active-games-angry-birds-kids-television/,Active Games Like 'Angry Birds' Are Better for Kids Than Watching TV,"Allowing your kids screen time is not necessarily a sedentary activity depending on what they're doing. A new study shows that playing video games is probably better for your young ones than letting them sit in front of the television.  Researchers in the Games Research and Interaction Design Lab at Queensland University of Technology examined the effects of games and television shows for children ages 2-5. They separated the media into two categories: passive or active. Active experiences can refer to content that stimulates them either physically or mentally. It turns out video games can stimulate kids both mentally and physically, and therefore are probably a better option, at least according to this study, than television.  Some games require light to moderate physical activity, while others require children to interact with the game.  The researchers determined active games can encourage young children to be physically active, and can also exercise their cognitive skills. Such games ""can improve academic performance, social skills and self esteem,"" says Dr Penny Sweetser, who was involved with the study, reported The Border Mail.  SEE ALSO: Can Gaming Help Kids Learn? [INFOGRAPHIC]  Still, this isn't a free pass to let Angry Birds babysit your child. Dr. Sweetser says parents need to engage with their children to really enhance their cognitive skills. But next time you need to let the screen distract your child long enough to make some food or brush your teeth, letting them play a video game might be a better option than plopping them in front of the television.  Keep in mind, though, there have also been reports that parents blame video games in particular for exposing their children to violence. And just this month, President Obama suggested more research be conducted to see the impact of violent video games and other media on children.  Parents: what media do you prefer your child to take-in — video games or television? What programming and/or games do you think are acceptable for your kids to watch or play? Tell us in the comments.

The performance will be her first televised one in the U.S. since the Grammys in 2012.  ""It's an honor to be nominated and terrifyingly wonderful to be singing in front of people who have captured my imagination over and over again,"" Adele said in a statement. ""It's something I've never experienced and probably only ever will once."" The song is nominated for Best Original Song against ""Before My Time"" from Chasing Ice, ""Pi's Lullaby"" from Life Of Pi, ""Suddenly"" from Les Misérables and ""Everybody Needs A Best Friend"" from Ted. Adele recently won Best Original Song for ""Skyfall"" at the Golden Globes.   In October, Adele teased ""Skyfall"" on Twitter with a photo of what appeared to be a pile of sheet music, and Adele's Facebook page revealed the single's artwork. Soon after, audio leaked, and a radio station played ""Skyfall"" too early before the studio version came out. Adele recorded the song along with a 77-piece orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London. ""When we recorded the strings it was one of the proudest moments of my life,"" Adele previously said. ""I'll be back combing my hair when I'm 60 telling people I was a Bond girl back in the day I'm sure.” In 2012, the Oscars didn't have any performances from the Best Original Song category.  ""We have enormous respect for Adele's unique artistry as a songwriter and a singer,"" Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, producers of the 2013 Oscars, said in a statement. ""She is currently one of the most successful recording artists in the world, and we believe that her performance of 'Skyfall' will be an exciting Oscar moment for audiences watching at the Dolby Theatre and on television screens around the world.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/amazon-kindle-canada/,Amazon's Latest Kindles Finally Come to Canada,"There are fewer than 100 miles between Amazon's Seattle headquarters and the Canadian border, but Canadians are only now getting access to Amazon's latest e-readers, the Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite. Although Amazon has already launched local Kindle stores in Europe, Asia and South America — the first as early as 2010 — Canadians didn't get their own e-bookstore until December, and access to Amazon's two-day shipping program until earlier this month. Amazon's entry-level E Ink reader, the Kindle, costs CDN $89, the same price as the ad-free version of the Kindle sold in the U.S. (the exchange rate is currently roughly equal). The two versions of the Kindle Paperwhite — one with 3G, and one without — have also been priced to match their U.S. counterparts, costing CDN $199 and CDN $139, respectively. They are available for purchase on Amazon's website, as well as around 1,000 other retail locations, including The Source, Staples, and Shoppers Drug Mart, an Amazon spokesperson tells Mashable. Now that Canada has its own Kindle store — which is said to offer 1.5 million e-books, 50,000 of which are French-language titles — Kindle owners can buy e-books directly from their devices, as well.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/amiigo-weareable-sensor/,Amiigo Is a Smart Wearable Sensor That Knows What Activity You're Doing," Wearable sensors or fitness-tracking bracelets, such as the Nike+ FuelBand or Fitbit Flex, are starting to go mainstream. But now, there's a new competitor in town — the Amiigo.  The team of entrepreneurs behind this new wristband claims their product is better than the others because it can automatically tell what kind of exercise you're performing. Amiigo will also be able to differentiate more than 100 exercises, track your movements and collect a number of physiological metrics like heart rate and blood oxygen levels.  ""Amiigo provides a more personalized fitness tracking experience because we can detect exactly what you are doing and how your body is responding,"" the group states in their Indiegogo campaign. Amiigo offers two sensors, a wristband and a shoe clip. They both collect data independently and users won't need both to track their fitness activity, although using them together will increase accuracy. One collects data from upper body activity, while the other focuses on the lower body.  The sensors pair up with the iOS and Android apps to give you a detailed breakdown of your exercise as well as the ability to share your workout on social networks. ""Our main focus is to make fitness more fun,"" Abe Carter, one of the co-founders, told Wired. ""That whole social environment is a lot better and engaging if you have more data to share and you can use your actual workouts to compete."" SEE ALSO: With Fitbit Flex You Never Stop Monitoring Your Fitness
 The team has recently launched a crowdsorucing campaign on Indiegogo to raise money to fund the project. Depending how much you donate, you will receive an Amiigo in return. At the time of writing, the campaign has reached more than $160,000, easily surpassing the initial goal of $90,000.  To find out more about this tracking sensor, check out the video above.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/apple-q1-earnings/,Apple Revenues Hit Record High With 75 Million iOS Devices Sold,"Apple had record sales in the December quarter, but the numbers were still not strong enough to please Wall Street. Apple sold 47.8 million iPhones in the quarter, compared to 37 million in the same quarter a year ago and a new record for the company. However, it missed Wall Street's estimates of 50 million iPhones. Meanwhile, the company reported selling 22.9 million iPads for the quarter, which came in just shy of the 23 million iPads analysts had expected Apple to sell.  Apple reported revenue of $54.5 billion — more than the entire annual revenue of Google in 2012 and a new record for the company — but it still came in slightly below analysts' estimates for revenue of $54.7 billion. On the bright side, Apple's profits beat estimates with earnings-per-share of $13.81 compared to estimates that it would fall to $13.44 per share. ""We're thrilled with record revenue of over $54 billion and sales of over 75 million iOS devices in a single quarter,"" said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, in a statement. ""We're very confident in our product pipeline as we continue to focus on innovation and making the best products in the world."" The company's stock has taken a beating in recent months, declining by about 30% since September on concerns about iPhone supply issues, management changes and a potential decline in the company's profit margin. In recent days, Apple's stock has hovered around the $500 mark as investors appeared unsure whether the company was heading back towards its high of $705 a share or lower into the 400s. These earnings numbers appear to have confirmed investor fears of the latter. Shares of Apple declined by nearly 5% in after hours trading to $490 following the earnings report.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/apple-q4-earnings-preview/,Apple Earnings Preview: What to Expect,"Every Apple earnings report is a big event, but today's earnings report is especially significant. Apple's September quarter earnings report disappointed investors. Though the company beat expectations for iPhone sales by a decent margin, it fell short on iPad sales and perhaps more importantly, Apple projected that it would report a significantly lower profit margin in the following quarter than analysts had expected. Apple's stock fell below $600 the next day for the first time in three months and has continued to decline, falling to as low as $483 a share in intraday trading last week. In recent days, Apple's stock has hovered right around the $500 mark, as investors appear unsure whether the stock is set to skyrocket back towards its high of $705 just after the iPhone 5 was released or plummet lower into the 400s. That, in a nutshell, is what hinges on the December earnings report. Investors are waiting to see how well Apple's new products have sold and how much they have started to cut into the company's profit margin.  AAPL data by YCharts Much of the focus will be on the iPhone 5 in particular. Ever since the device was released in mid-September, there have been reports that Apple's suppliers were struggling to manufacture enough phones to meet demand. More recently, there have been multiple reports that Apple has cut its supply orders for iPhone 5 parts in half for the March quarter, suggesting to some that demand is lower than expected. Even so, analysts are expecting a record quarter for iPhone sales, but the range of estimates varies from as low as 43 million to more than 60 million, with a median estimate of about 50 million.  Apple is also expected to have strong iPad sales of 23 million, according to Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster, 9 million more than were sold in the previous quarter thanks largely to the release of the iPad Mini in October.  Based on the strength of iPhone and iPad sales, Apple is expected to report record revenue of $54.73 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by compiled by Thomson Reuters. While that's an impressive figure, it would represent the slowest growth in Apple sales since 2009. To make matters worse, Apple's net income is expected to decline for the first time in a decade due to higher costs associated with producing new products like the iPhone 5 and iPad Mini and lower price tags for older iPhone models and the iPad Mini. Right now, the consensus estimate is that Apple will report earnings-per-share of $13.44 for the quarter, down from $13.87 per share in the same quarter a year ago — a decline of about 3%.

However, as usual, Apple's conference call with analysts gave a glimpse into how big exactly the company has become. Below are some numerical highlights: Apple sent 4 trillion notifications to customers in the quarter. Some 450 billion iMessages were sent. Game Center has 200 million users. Apple has $137.1 billion in cash on hand.  The company sold 22.9 million iPads in the quarter. It also sold 47.8 million iPhones. Sales of iOS devices topped 75 million. Mac sales for the quarter were 4.1 million, compared to 5.2 million in the comparable quarter in the previous year. Apple has 401 Apple Stores; 150 are outside the U.S. The company sold 2 million Apple TVs in the quarter, a 60% jump over the comparable year-ago quarter. Image courtesy of Apple "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/biden-google-hangout/,Joe Biden Will Talk Gun Control in Google Hangout,"Vice President Joe Biden will discuss the Obama administration's position on gun control in a Google Hangout on Thursday at 1:45 p.m. EST, Google and the vice president's office announced Wednesday. Biden's hangout will be a resurrection of the so-called ""Fireside Hangouts,"" the White House's series of conversations with top officials via the video chat feature on Google+. The name is a play on the radio-based Fireside Chats famously held by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt between 1933 and 1944. Joining Biden on Thursday will be Guy Kawasaki, one of the original Apple employees, video blogger Phil DeFranco and moderator Hari Sreenivasan of PBS NewsHour. Questions can be submitted ahead of the panel by replying to Google+ posts from the participants or from the White House (Biden notably doesn't have an active Google+ profile). SEE ALSO: President Obama's First Google+ Hangout: How'd He Do?
 Biden was charged with leading a gun reform task force by President Barack Obama following the December shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., that claimed 27 lives including that of the shooter.  The Obama administration is pushing for Congress to pass criminal background checks for all gun sales, reinstating the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, limiting magazine rounds to 10 rounds and other reforms. Last week, Obama took more than 20 executive actions in an effort to reduce gun violence.  Obama last held a hangout in January. What would you ask Biden in the Google Hangout? Share in the comments.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/blackberry-enterprise-service-10/,RIM Offers Early Taste of BlackBerry 10,"Ahead of its BlackBerry 10 launch later this month for its new line of smartphones, Research In Motion (RIM) announced on Wednesday the latest version of its mobile management solution for businesses. The BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10, which is now available for download, will run on BlackBerry 10 smartphones and is compatible with Android and iOS devices. The software will be instrumental in how BlackBerry 10 will be publicly received and could determine the overall future of the struggling company. As of now, the software is available to government agencies and corporate clients. Among the key functions is a separation of work and personal applications on individual devices, as well as data, to make it easy for those using the same phone for corporate and individual use to separate work and play. SEE ALSO: RIM May License BlackBerry 10 to Other Manufacturers
 The company also promises better support for work email, content and secure connectivity to “behind the firewall” applications and data. The software will also come with BlackBerry World for Work, the new corporate app storefront for BlackBerry 10 smartphones that allows organizations to set up their own app stores for employees. “BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10 empowers employees to be more productive and better equipped to serve customers while it provides business and IT leaders with the confidence that corporate data is protected and manageable in the same way they have long enjoyed with BlackBerry,” said Peter Devenyi, senior vice president of enterprise software at Research In Motion, in a statement. “BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10 makes mobility easy for businesses to help keep them moving.” The news also coincides with the ending of the company's mobile device management software Mobile Fusion as a standalone product. Moving forward, it will be a part of the new BlackBerry Enterprise Service, and the company specified an upgrade path on its official blog. Image via Flickr, Official BlackBerry Images You unlock a BlackBerry 10 device by swiping up from the bottom of the screen. When you swipe up, the lock screen dissolves into the home screen on the device. Swiping to the side brings up additional pages of apps. You can also navigate through pages of apps by tapping on the scroll bar on the bottom of the screen. Taking a page from Windows Phone, RIM is adding “Active Frames” to BB10. Much like the ""Live Tiles” found in Windows Phone, the frames update with information you can see at a glance. For instance, the weather app will show the current temperature as well as a 7-day forecast, the calendar app shows your next event for the day. BlackBerry Hub can be accessed by swiping across the screen. Contact cards include phone numbers, email addresses and social-networking details. RIM is taking the look and feel of its home screen and bringing it into groups. Active frames make an appearance in groups, allowing you to see chats pertaining to a particular group, people who are a part of the group, and photos that have been uploaded. Pictures change as they are uploaded to the group, so if someone uploads a new one then that image will change on the group's page. Tapping on a person in a group will bring up his or her contact card. Taking photos in BlackBerry 10 starts out much like taking photos with any other OS, with the ability to tap on any portion of the photo to focus on a specific portion of the frame. If a photo you take is blurry, or someone in the picture has his or her eyes closed, you can use the scroll bar on the bottom of the screen to move forward and backward in time to capture the perfect shot. Much like you can adjust a whole picture, you can also pic out individual faces in a photo to adjust. So, if one friend has her eyes closed in a picture, you can just adjust herface in the photo. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/bloomberg-billionaires-index/,Bloomberg Billionaires Visualization Lets You Track World's Wealthiest People,"Bloomberg on Tuesday launched a new Bloomberg Billionaires data visualization and research tool, giving users an easy-to-use interactive way to track the world's wealthiest people. The Bloomberg Billionaires index previously listed the name, estimated net worth, country and daily financial changes of the top 40 wealthiest people. The new index takes the same core principle but adds a wealth of additional data displayed in maps and charts with options that turn the index into an interactive encyclopedia of knowledge about the richest people on Earth. The new Index's opening view shows headshots of the world's richest people. Hovering your mouse over a billionaire's face reveals their name and some other data, while clicking takes you to a biographical page with the person's history, net worth, Bloomberg stories about him or her and other information updated daily. Note that some faces are left blank due to a lack of current photographs of some individuals. Also note that Bloomberg founder Michael Bloomberg is not on the list as it's company policy not to cover Bloomberg L.P.  It's the new graphical displays, however, that are most interesting to play around with. A ""ranking"" option lets you track billionaires' wealth compared to one another over time. A ""plot"" option gives you the ability to plot any of the available data points on individual billionaires against other data points, i.e. net worth rankings against percentage of wealth held in private assets. And a ""map"" option shows a heat map of the concentration of wealth across the planet.   All of the options, too, are highly customizable: One may isolate billionaires based on home country, industry, age, gender and source of wealth (whether it was inherited or self-made). Users can also define a range of dates for which to search, revealing interesting trends about billionaire's fortunes over time, the transfer of wealth and the planet's overall economic health.  Bloomberg has previously held this data internally, but is now providing it to the public free of charge. The idea, Editor of Bloomberg Billionaires Matt Miller told Mashable, is to provide Bloomberg's data on global billionaires to a mass audience. Accordingly, the new data visualization tool should prove useful in the hands of reporters, students, researchers and anybody who just happens to be curious about the wealthiest people on the planet.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/bluetooth-device-track-phone-valuables/,Bluetooth Device Keeps Track of Your Phone and Other Valuables,"The hipKey, a new Bluetooth device designed to keep track of your personal items, is now available in the U.S. Apple Online store. We first saw hipKey at the 2013 International CES and, while it's not the only Bluetooth tracking device out there, we were impressed with its design and function. The hipKey is shaped like a tiny crescent moon, made of smooth aluminum that attaches to your bag or keys. Or, as some have pointed out, you can attach it to a child who has a tendency to wander, or perhaps a pet. We like the design because the function keys are hidden inside the crescent, making them difficult to press by accident. By using low-energy Bluetooth 4.0, it has a range of about 50 meters, or 164 feet, and battery life is purportedly between three and four weeks. The battery can be recharged via micro-USB.   The hipKey app offers a little more functionality than other Bluetooth trackers we've seen, like the SticknFind. Like the others, it has an Alarm mode which warns you if your iPad or iPhone leaves your side. However, it also has a Safe Zone feature that lets you control and personalize locations. So if you're engrossed in texting on your phone and your iPad slowly leaves your side, the alarm will sound. But if you're home and your partner or kid grabs the iPad to look something up, it won't sound because that's been designated a safe zone. The Find Me mode is helpful for those of you who constantly forget where you put things. Pushing the button triggers an alarm that sends you the location of your bag or iPad. The Motion mode alerts you if someone moves the item attached to the hipKey, helpful if you're not in a position to keep an eye on things.  SEE ALSO: Did You Know Bluetooth Was Named for a Danish King?
 Lastly, the Child mode helps keep track of your kids in a crowded public place. Or if you want to cheat at Hide-and-Seek. You can set a perimeter that the kids are allowed to be in, but once they leave that area, the alarm sounds to warn you they're out of range. You can then use the Find Me feature to locate them.   I haven't used these tracking devices on kids but having seen enough toddlers walking around busy streets and malls with a real leash or tether tied around their waist that I think this might be a good option.  The hipKey first launched in European Apple Online Stores in December and quickly sold out. The U.S. version will cost $89. Have you used a Bluetooth tracker to help locate kids or personal devices?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/broadband-access-ports-rail-electricity/,"Access to Broadband Is the New Access to Ports, Rail, Electricity","In the 21st century, a small business in Kansas City, Mo., has at least one very important thing in common with a small business in Seoul, Korea: Both have access to ultra high-speed Internet — Kansas City via Google Fiber and Seoul on account of its government championing the rollout of fiber optic internet for over a decade. That’s one way to look at Akamai’s quarterly ""state of the internet"" report, in which the content serving company samples requests to its own servers to reveal internet connectivity speeds all over the world.  As usual, countries with the most people with Internet connections faster than 10 megabits per second are the densely populated, rich economies of Asia (South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong) and Scandinavia (Switzerland, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Finland). There are also a couple of surprises: Latvia and the United States. The U.S. is both sprawling, making connectivity more expensive and beset by broadband monopolists. The list of countries by average connection speed is similar, although the Czech Republic squeezes Sweden off the list. This measure of internet speed can be skewed by a small number of much faster Internet connections, so it's arguably a less democratic measure of high-speed Internet access.  One thing these rankings don't show is the distribution of Internet speeds within a country. In the U.S., for example, it varies a great deal depending on whether you're in an urban area with access to a fiberoptic hookup from Google or Verizon or in a remote area with nothing but the a rural telephone collective to connect you. It's difficult to disentangle cause and effect when it comes to broadband. Do rich countries spend on it so their citizens can stream more movies, or does having broadband make you rich? But it seems likely that broadband is a great enabler, like mass transit, good ports, a system of functioning courts and other hallmarks of developed economies. As Daniel Ek, CEO of Spotify, emphasized to me the last time we spoke, the one reason a country as small as Sweden has a disproportionate share of successful Internet startups is that Swedish teenagers grow up taking gigabit Internet connections for granted. And it's not just traditional web startups and IT giants that need fast internet connectivity. Arguably, as businesses move more functions to the cloud and mobile becomes increasingly important, everyone needs fast Internet connectivity.  Whether you’re a manufacturer who has to conduct remote meetings with suppliers in distant countries or a sales department that requires its cloud-based customer relations management software to be fast and responsive, fast broadband Internet is now a core infrastructure requirement not unlike reliable transportation and energy.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/business-cards-review-is-coming/,'Business Cards' Let Restaurants Know You Might Write a Review,"Have you ever left a restaurant after experiencing either fabulous or really lousy service and went online to write a review of it? Congratulations, you too can now be a restaurant reviewer. Self-described ""lifelong entrepreneur"" Brad Newman says his ReviewerCard program is a great way for people to let a restaurant or business know they'll be writing a review about it. He's selling Reviewer ID cards for $100 bucks a piece to bloggers he thinks merit ReviewerCard status. He tells the LA Times he screens the applicants to make sure they only go to worthwhile applicants. Newman says he got the idea for the card after he was treated rudely by a waiter on a trip to France. When he complained, he mentioned he planned to post a negative review on travel site TripAdvisor. That brought a visit from a manager who apologized and comped his breakfast.  SEE ALSO: By 2014, 1 in 10 Social Media Reviews Will Be Fake And therein lies the issue of the threat of a negative review. With our reliance on social media and review sites like Yelp for restaurant suggestions, most anyone can be called a ""reviewer"" these days. And when you read a review, if you're like us, you'd probably rather get an honest account of how the average person is treated. If someone walks in carrying the threat of a bad review with them, they may get preferential treatment, or something the average Joe may not ever taste or see.  In fact before the Internet, NY Times restaurant critic Ruth Reichl went out of her way to make sure her identity wasn't known when she entered a restaurant. That way she was assured an unbiased experience — no preferential treatment or special food. In this video from 2001 she describes using wigs and make-up to conceal her identity. Newman defends his cards saying they ""empower reviewers and protect businesses."" He says businesses want to know when a review is coming but the flip side of that plays on the fears of the restaurant owner who might be worried about a negative review. SEE ALSO: Yelp Cracks Down on Fake Reviews With New Consumer Alerts Consumers want to read real accounts, not fakes. Yelp already began an effort to crack down on fake reviews by introducing a consumer alert label that appears on the pages of businesses who are caught buying reviews. So what do you think?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/clinton-benghazi-hearings/,Hillary Clinton's Very Long Day Testifying to Congress,"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spent Wednesday in Congress, splitting her time between Senate and House hearings on the September 2012 attack against an American consolate in Benghazi, Libya.  Her treatment in both hearings was split along party lines: Most Democrats praised her service while many Republicans criticized her for what they see as a failure to prevent the attack that took four American lives including that of Ambassador John Christopher Stevens. Here's what Clinton's day looked like: Clinton choked up discussing the State Department's lost employees during her opening statement during the Senate hearing: Video courtesy NowThisNews She defended U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, who appeared on Sunday talk shows following the attack and claimed the consolate attack was in response to an anti-Islam YouTube video: Video courtesy NowThisNews Clinton brushed off further criticism from Ron Jonhson (R-Wis.), who aggressively questioned her over the video. ""With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans,"" responded Clinton amid Johnson's interruptions. ""Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk last night who decided to kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It's our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator."" Video courtesy NowThisNews And here's what Clinton looked like while rebuking Johnson: Photo via Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said that Clinton's upcoming depature from the Secretary of State position means that she accepts ""the culpability for the worst tragedy since 9/11.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/customix/,New Web App Customizes Music for TV and Movies,"Music can make or break a TV show, movie or even an advertisement. In entertainment media, a perfectly selected song will complement the visuals and dialogue, and enhance the overall impact. If you begin to notice more of those befitting songs in the coming months and years, a new web app released Wednesday could be the reason why. Extreme Music, a popular music production library, just introduced a new feature called Customix to its website. Customix lets music supervisors quickly edit songs they plan to license. The app allows users to adjust the volume to individual elements of a track (vocals, drums, guitar, bass, etc.), change a song's tempo without changing its pitch and edit the length of a song without cutting it into pieces. ""This is a really dramatic change in the way in which we work and in which our clients work,"" Extreme Music CEO Russell Emanuel told Mashable. ""The whole ethos behind this is that it breathes many different lives into one single musical track."" Customix works with many of the 13,000 songs in Extreme Music's library, which includes tracks from artists like Hans Zimmer, Quincy Jones, George Martin and Snoop Lion. One doesn't need one of those producer's acumen to use Customix, however — it was designed as an easy-to-use tool. ""One of the powers of this application is that it turns you into a music editor without needing the deep music knowledge that a skilled music supervisor would need,"" Emanuel said. SEE ALSO: The New Myspace: Music Meets Social, Done Right
 Given a demo version, I was able to customize a track in under five minutes. After logging in, I first selected a type of music — ""Celtic Punk."" Then I picked a song called ""Craic Addict"" (craic is an Irish term for fun). I entered that I wanted the song to be one minute in length, at which point the app smartly adjusted. Then I muted the vocals, drums, electric guitars and lowered the volume on the bass. Lastly, I dropped the tempo to 120 beats per minute. In just a short time, I turned an agressive song with a driving beat, which sounded like it should have been in The Departed, into a mellow and sweet tune, perfect for my imaginary one-minute clip. Check out the screenshot below to see my customized ""Craic Addict.""   Songs from Extreme Music's library grace the soundtracks of works such as Lincoln, Mad Men and Dexter.  Kevin Edelman, of Metalman Music, is the music supervisor for several shows, including Homeland and Criminal Minds. He recently demoed a beta version of Customix. “To be able to create my own mix on the fly, plus the ability to change the speed of a track, makes my life so much easier,"" Edelman said in a press release. ""This really is a giant leap forward and seriously changes the game.” According to Emanuel, Extreme Music is the only production library that offers anything like Customix, but that will not last long.  ""There's no question in my mind that everyone will be working this way,"" Emanuel said. ""It's a dramatic change in the industry."" Information about Customix leaked last week. Immediately UJAM, the app's developer, began getting requests from other companies for similar products.  ""We cannot disclose who we are in negotiations with, but we have seen enormous interest since the Customix information has leaked,"" UJAM CEO Axel Hensen told Mashable. ""Businesses in this space realize this technology is essential for a competitive advantage."" Customix is only available to Extreme Music's subscribers, which means it's probably not for you unless you're an industry pro, or if you're independently producing high quality content for digital distribution. On the bright side, that means you can just kick back and relax, knowing that more felicitous music is on its way to the shows and movies you love to watch.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/dna-replace-hard-drive/,Why DNA Will Someday Replace the Hard Drive,"DNA could someday store more than just the blueprints for life — it could also house vast collections of documents, music, or video in an impossibly compact format that lasts for thousands of years. Researchers at the European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton, U.K., have demonstrated a new method for reliably encoding several common computer file formats this way. As the price of sequencing and synthesizing DNA continues to drop, the researchers estimate, this biological storage medium will be competitive within the next few decades. The information storage density of DNA is at least a thousand times greater than that of existing media, but until recently the cost of DNA synthesis was too high for the technology to be anything more than a curiosity. Conventional methods of storing digital information for prolonged periods continue to pose problems, however.  The magnetic tapes typically used for archival storage become brittle and lose their coating after a few decades. And even if the physical medium used to store information remains intact, storage formats are always changing. This means the data has to be transferred to a new format or it may become unreadable. DNA, in contrast, remains stable over time—and it’s one format that’s always likely to be useful. “We want to separate the storage medium from the machine that will read it,” says project leader Nick Goldman. “We will always have technologies for reading DNA.” Goldman notes that intact DNA fragments tens of thousands of years old have been found and that DNA is stable for even longer if it’s refrigerated or frozen. The U.K. researchers encoded DNA with an MP3 of Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech, a PDF of a scientific paper, an ASCII text file of Shakespeare’s sonnets, and a JPEG color photograph. The storage density of the DNA files is about 2.2 petabytes per gram. Others have demonstrated DNA data storage before. This summer, for example, researchers led by Harvard University genetics professor George Church used the technology to encode a book. The difference with the new work, says Goldman, is that the researchers focused on a practical, error-tolerant design. To make the DNA files, the researchers created software that converted the 1s and 0s of the digital realm into the genetic alphabet of DNA bases, labeled A, T, G and C. The program ensures that there are no repeated bases such as “AA” or “GG,” which lead to higher error rates when synthesizing and sequencing DNA. The files were divided into segments, each bookended with an index code that contains information about which file it belongs to and where it belongs within that file—analogous to the title and page number on pages of a book. The encoding software also ensures some redundancy. Each part of a file is represented in four different fragments, so even if several degrade, it should still be possible to reconstruct the data. Working with genomics company Agilent Technologies of Santa Clara, California, the researchers synthesized the fragments of DNA and then demonstrated that they could sequence them and accurately reconstruct the files. This work is described today in the journal Nature. Goldman’s group estimates that encoding data in DNA currently costs $12,400 per megabyte, plus $220 per megabyte to read that data back. If the price of DNA synthesis comes down by two orders of magnitude, as it is expected to do in the next decade, says Goldman, DNA data storage will soon cost less than archiving data on magnetic tapes. Victor Zhirnov, program director for memory technologies at the Semiconductor Research Corporation in Durham, North Carolina, says that because the current cost is so high, data-storing DNA will probably find its earliest use in long-term archives that aren’t accessed frequently. Looking ahead, he says, he can envision “a more aggressive technology” to replace flash, the nonvolatile memory technology found in portable electronics, which is already reaching its scaling limits. The key will be developing entire hardware systems that work with DNA, not just sequencers and synthesizers. Harvard’s Church says he is working on this very problem. “We can keep incrementally improving our ability to read and write DNA, but I want to jump completely out of that box,” he says. Church is currently developing a system for directly encoding analog signals such as video and audio into DNA, eliminating conventional electronics altogether. Image courtesy of Flickr, micahb37

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/facebook-more-memorable-faces-books/,Facebook More Memorable Than Faces or Books," Facebook posts and reader comments are more memorable than human faces or sentences from books, a new study says. Researchers found that status updates are one-and-a-half times more memorable than sentences from books and two-and-a-half times more memorable than faces.  The same researchers from the University of California, San Diego, and the University of Warwick are looking into how microblogs relate to human memory, with the same results applying to tweets, and most likely text messages.  The succinct, unedited tone of microblogging brings people closer to natural language, making it ""mind-ready,"" says cognitive psychologist Laura Mickes.  ""I think this works across the board,"" Mickes tells Mashable. ""It's not just who you're writing to, it's your audience. It's how you sit down and write these things with unfiltered, spontaneous language.""  All those seemingly-trivial snippets all over your news feed aren't as forgettable as you may think. Shared information does have a privileged status and is remembered more readily, the study says.  Mickes and her colleagues gathered 200 anonymous Facebook posts and removed emoticons, all-CAPS, multiple exclamation points and other distractions. Statuses included philosophical musings such as, ""i am 7,689 days old..."" and ""Bc sometimes it makes me wonder."" Random sentences from books were also given to subjects, including ""Cody raised his .40 Sig Sauer in a shooter’s grip,"" and ""Even honor had its limits."" The self-paced recognition tests showed that posts were more memorable.  SEE ALSO: How Facebook Can Make You Envious
 The same type of method was applied with faces, but Facebook posts trumped facial recognition. In a similar fashion, CNN news headlines were tested with reader comments. User posts like ""I am an unemployed teacher in the deep south"" won out over breaking news sentences of the same length.  Entertainment headlines with a ""gossipy"" tone, much like Facebook posts, were also easily recalled. Users who posted were of all ages, showcasing that the effectiveness of ""mind-ready"" language is not limited to the young.  What impact do you think microblogs have on your memory?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/facebook-most-used-app/,ComScore: Facebook Is Now the Most Used Mobile App in US,"Facebook is the most popular mobile app in the U.S. in terms of unique users — at least for now.  The signature Facebook app passed Google Maps in October of last year to become the most used mobile app in the U.S. and held onto the top spot through the end of the year, according to data released Wednesday by comScore Mobile Metrix.  Facebook's app enjoyed strong growth in 2012 with 85.5 million monthly unique users in the U.S. in December across iOS, Android and RIM's mobile platforms, up from just under 65 million in March, when comScore first started tracking mobile app data. (In October, Facebook reported 604 million monthly mobile users worldwide.) Google Maps, on the other hand, saw its active user numbers dip from about 80 million in August and September to a little more than 70 million in October after it was removed as a default app on iOS 6.  ""Both Google Maps and Facebook were growing nicely throughout the year until that happened,"" Andrew Lipsman, VP of industry analysis at comScore, told Mashable. ""Facebook continued that trend and Google Maps took a dip that one month and now it's climbing back."" Google launched a new Maps app for iOS 6 in mid-December, and Lipsman says it's likely Maps will grow its user numbers at a faster rate going forward, though it's unclear whether and when the app will return to the top spot.  ComScore's mobile app data is based on browsing behavior tracks from a panel of users as well as supplemental data from publishers showing app usage. The numbers represent active visitors to apps — rather than app downloads — similar to the way that comScore tracks visitors to websites. While Facebook currently held the top spot at the end of the year, Google had the next five most used apps, including Google Maps, Gmail and YouTube. Lipsman credited this to the growth of Android and the popularity of Google services in general.  Aside from having the largest audience, Facebook's app also has by far the highest level of engagement. According to comScore, Facebook's app accounted for 23% of time spent on mobile apps while all of Google's apps collectively account for 10% of time spent. Who says Facebook doesn't get mobile?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/fitness-gadget-gym-cost-comparison/,Fitness Gadgets: Cheaper Than a Gym Membership?,"No one ever said staying or getting fit was easy — or cheap.  There are so many fitness tracking gadgets to chose from these days, and many more reasons why you might want one. Wearable trackers offer convenience and constant motivation. But price-wise, how do they compare to your gym membership? How do they compare to each other?  Nike+ Kinect, naturally, wants to convince you its Xbox-based system is an effective price proposition. Below is their gym cost infographic; we've gone further and added the details and cost of other fitness gadgets.   The fee listed for an average gym membership seems high to us (living in San Francisco, I still pay slightly less than that and go to a pretty good gym). A spokesperson for Nike+ Kinect said they were surprised at the high number — but when they factored in high-end gyms (like Equinox), it added up.  A site called Statistics Brain suggests the average gym cost is $55 per month, seconding that information. Also, keep in mind many gyms have an initiation charge of about $100.    SEE ALSO: Nike+Kinect Training on Xbox Will Whip You Into Shape  We also compiled a cost breakdown of gadgets and game consoles that you can use in place of, or along with, your gym routine. And this isn't an either/or situation, you can take your Fitbit tracker or LINK armband to the gym, or workout using Wello while you're on vacation.  Check out how the prices of these gadgets and consoles compare:  Wii Fit: The Wii Fit requires you to buy the Wii console, plus a balance board. The console costs about $165 and the board retails for about $100. The Wii Fit will certainly make you sweat, and it's a lot of fun. You can workout with up to 8 people, so long as everyone has a balance board. It comes with preloaded workouts, like yoga and strength training.  larklife: From company Lark, the larklife is a two-wristband system to track your steps/calories burned, and another to track your sleep. The larklife system comes with a daytime band, a nighttime band, one larklife core (the brains that you move from the day to the night band), a micro-USB charging cord, a USB AC adaptor and syncs to the free larklife app for iOS devices. It retails for $150. Fitbit: This company offers a number of fitness trackers that all sync using Bluetooth to the free mobile and web applications. The Fitbit Zip costs monitors steps, distance and calories burned. It costs $60. The Fitbit One tracks what the Zip does, plus stairs and you can wear it at night to track your sleep. It costs $100. Launching this spring is the Fitbit Flex, a wristband that monitors activity and sleep. It costs about $100. MOVband: You wear this tracker like a watch; you can even buy changeable wristbands for about $5 each to mix-up the colors. The MOVband tracks all your movements and syncs that data (via USB) to your free online account where you can monitor your activity level. The tracker costs $30. Nike+ Kinect: Kinect for Xbox 360 is a pretty intuitive device. It uses a sensor to read your steps, so unlike the Wii, no board is needed. Just place the Kinect on a shelf by your TV or on your media stand facing you. Combine that technology with Nike's fitness know-how and you have a kick-butt at-home workout. Create a custom workout on Nike+ Kinect that matches your fitness level. It retails for $50, and the Xbox 360 plus the Kinect devices costs as low as $99 plus a two year contract for about $15 per month, or buying the Xbox 360 4GB with the Kinect without a contract costs about $300.  Wello: This is not a gadget or device, but a website where you can connect with a personal trainer and workout together live via video chat. It's important both people have a good Internet connection for this to work. Training sessions are offered in 30 or 60 minute sessions, and prices depend on the level of training the instructor has and range from $19-119 per session. BodyMedia LINK: The LINK armband is the only armband BodyMedia sells with Bluetooth (a must-have feature on a tracker). The LINK counts steps, calorie burned, sleep and it can sync to a heart rate monitor. It retails for about $150. You can sync the data the LINK tracks to the free SparkPeople website, a massive community of fitness enthusiasts, where you'll also find lots of health and fitness information. Or to the free BodyMedia FIT app on your iPhone or Android device. BodyMedia also gives you three months free access to its web application as part of the LINK purchase price. If you want to continue using the web app after three months it costs $7 per month. Up by Jawbone: This waterproof wristband tracks sleep and exercise habits. You can also track calories by entering food items, or for a faster way to record your eating habits, Up lets you take pictures of your meals and write how you felt afterwards. It retails for $129.99. There have been complaints, though, that the end cap on the wristband falls off easily. And you need to take the cap off when charging or syncing the device (it does not have Bluetooth). The iOS app has a 4+ rating, and reviews for the Up are mixed on Amazon (keep in mind the newest model seems to have much better reviews that the original). Nike+ FuelBand: This wristband tracks your activity level with an accelerometer. You can set a goal and monitor how close you are to reaching that goal through the app. The data from the wristbands syncs to a several apps. It costs $150.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/free-ipad-second-screen-app/,Turn Your iPad Into a Second Monitor for Free,"So you want to expand your real screen estate but don’t have the money for a second monitor? You can instead use your iPad as a second monitor with one of these free iPad apps. SplashtopXD Splashtop has a collection of second-screen tablet apps, but its free SplashtopXD more than does the job. But with the free version, you will have to make some sacrifices when it comes to features, like remotely wiping the screen. Setting up the application is relatively simple. Just download both the app and the Splashtop Streamer PC software, and the two will communicate with each other. The app should recognize your PC on opening. After setting a password, you'll have options to tweak and improve video, audio or bring up the virtual keyboard. The app also gives you hints and tips, but these can be turned off if you wish. In terms of performance, there is not much between Splashtop XD and other second-screen iPad apps like DisplayLink, although we did find that Splashtop XD occasionally lagged when moving the cursor on a web page. AirDisplay Free AirDisplay Free is similar to the paid-for AirDisplay iPad app, but does compensate for being free by featuring a number of ads on the second screen. On installing the desktop client (from Avatron.com/d) and the iPad app, we found AirDisplay to be OK, if slightly fiddly. Sharing between PC and iPad is not as fluid as it could be and re-sizing file windows is difficult because of the banner ad —- which cannot be moved — at the top of the screen, and the keyboard option at the bottom. Nonetheless, it is functional and does support AirSharing with other iOS users and PrintSharing with compatible AirPrint printers. The display arrangement can support the option to run Retina resolution when available. Photo courtesy of Flickr, JuditK

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/gmail-terms-conditions/,12 Ways to Get Banned From Gmail,"Just how bad do you have to be to get banned from Gmail? How many policies and terms do you have to violate to warrant suspension, or worse, Google termination?  Google has discretion on the site, with the sole power to warn, suspend or terminate those in violation of its policies at any time.  SEE ALSO: 9 Things We Wish Gmail Could Do
 In order to ensure your continued ease of access with Gmail, we've compiled a list of things you shouldn't do — unless you want to lose your account. 1. Impersonate another person (via the use of an email address or otherwise) or otherwise misrepresent yourself or the source of any email.  Don't use someone else's Gmail account and write emails pretending like you are him or her. According to Time, there are nine states with online impersonation laws, and in New York and California online impersonation is a misdemeanor punishable by thousands of dollars in fines and up to a year in jail. So just don't create fake Gmail accounts in the first place. Ahem, Lennay Kekua, cough cough.  2. Send emails to users who have requested to be removed from a mailing list.  If you are still receiving emails from an address you unsubscribed from, try the troubleshooting advice in this Google blog post: unsubscribing made easy. Google launched a service that messages senders on your behalf, asking them to unsubscribe you from their list. Unfortunately it doesn't work for all senders right now, but Google is encouraging senders to support auto-unsubscribe. 3. Sell, exchange or distribute to a third party the email addresses of any person without his or her knowledge and consent. The going rate for 1 million U.S. email addresses is $25, making your personal email address worth $0.000025. Besides the fact that selling email addresses without the person's knowledge or consent is illegal, it's not very lucrative. Trying to make a quick buck? Don't do it this way. 4. Send unsolicited emails to significant numbers of email addresses belonging to people you don't know. Not only is selling email addresses illegal, but sending emails to a bunch of people you don't know is also illegal. So no, you cannot email blast the cast of Downton Abbey to ask about Matthew Crawley and Lady Mary's nuptials, or where Dan Stevens is eating dinner tonight... 5. Send, upload or distribute any unlawful, defamatory, harassing, abusive, fraudulent, infringing, obscene or otherwise objectionable content. Email fraud has become rampant as technology continues to develop, but sending harassing or obscene content is also illegal. The U.S. government has drafted up a helpful manual for recognizing fraudulent content with tips on what to do when you encounter it. This list of illegal content seems pretty all-inclusive, so just send, upload and distribute only cute pictures of cats, okay?  6. Conduct or forward pyramid schemes and the like. In order to avoid inadvertently becoming part of a pyramid scheme, check out some helpful tips. The old adage ""If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is"" works well in this situation. (Sorry, Bernie.) 7. Transmit content that may be harmful to minors.  In email and in life, ya heard? That includes child pornography, correspondence of a threatening, violent or graphic nature and age-restricted content, such as alcohol, drug or dating site material. 8. Illegally transmit another's intellectual property or other proprietary information without such owner's or licensor's permission. Go to Tumblr; it's called a ""reblog."" Just make sure you have permission before sending anyone's work through the Gmail service, or else face the consequences. 9. Interfere with other Gmail users' enjoyment of the service.   GIF courtesy of loverofeverythingsweet 10. Sell, trade, resell or otherwise exploit for any unauthorized commercial purpose or transfer any Gmail account. If you can't sell your account in the first place, how can you resell it? Besides that point, you can't make money from your domain name — even if it is really, really cool.  11. Use the Gmail service in connection with illegal peer-to-peer file sharing. If you are illegally downloading music, movies, or TV shows (tsk, tsk), don't use the Gmail service to share the content with your friends. But remember: Friends don't let friends illegally peer-to-peer file share.  12. Modify, adapt, translate or reverse engineer any portion of the Gmail service. Reverse engineering involves reproducing a manufacturer's product using a detailed examination of its construction. Basically, you can't take the structure of Gmail, copy it and then create your own email service.  Image courtesy of Flickr, lanuiop "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/google-glass-advertising/,How Google Glass Could Change Advertising,"It's 2015 and you've just arrived back in New York City from a weekend trip. You're standing in Times Square when it occurs to you that you're hungry. So, literally in the blink of an eye, you call up information about all the nearby restaurants. You realize, however, that you could also use some companionship so you say ""friends nearby restaurants."" Just then you see that a pal of yours has checked in to Fannelli Cafe in SoHo. You quickly text him and arrange to meet. When you call up directions, you get an offer for $2 off your first Guinness. All thanks to Google Glass. No, that's not an officially sanctioned use for Google's ambitious pair of Internet-connected spectacles. In fact, Google has stressed repeatedly that there will be no ads on Google Glass. ""There are no plans for advertising on this device,"" says a Google rep. ""We’re more interested in making the hardware available."" But ad execs can dream. Those who make their living via augmented reality have even more vivid dreams. For them, Google Glass isn't some weird 20% project, it's the future of advertising. ""Stop thinking of [augmented reality] as a business. It's a browser,"" says John Havens, founder of the H(app)athon Project. ""If this was 1992 and I told you there was something called a web browser that was going to change advertising, would you believe me? Yet that's what happened.""  That may not be just wishful thinking. If Google Glass and its imitators take off, it could literally change the way we see the world and the way we interact with brands. Just as the Internet completely overhauled marketing over the past 20 years or so, so can the ""Outernet."" In the process we'll move a step away from the arms-length relationship we consumers have had with brands and a step closer to a consumer-brand mind meld.  Is this possible? Those who are bullish on Google Glass point to the revved up adoption rates of new technologies. As Flurry Analytics reported last August, smartphones have taken off 10 times faster than the 80s PC revolution, two times faster than the 90s Internet boom and three times faster than the social networking revolution. ""If we go back look at how fast things are adopting lately compared to 10 to 15 years ago, we're looking at [mass adoption in] 2015 or 2016,"" says Andrew Couch, CEO of Candy Lab, an AR provider. Before we explore the fever dreams of AR ad execs though, a few caveats: One is that the idea of everyone in the late 2010s walking around with Sergey Brin's favorite piece of eyewear seems a little unrealistic. Who, beyond hardcore techies, would want to sport such a look? And even if Google Glass inevitably becomes indistinguishable from regular glasses, who would want to go through life surveying the world like the Terminator? Another is that Google hasn't given out much information about Google Glass. The company plans to launch an API for the device at some point and Google is looking to include phone functions, email and calendar features, but that's about it. For argument's sake, however, let's assume that Google Glass does take off and that it has everything advertisers are looking for. Now that the Outernet has really become a thing, how will we be carrying out our lives? How will brands inevitably colonize this new frontier? Here are a few potential scenarios: Coupon Offers The idea of using Google Glass to scout nearby friends for an impromptu lunch date isn't fantastical at all. In fact, the technology already exists. Last June, Facebook released a ""Find Friends Nearby"" feature that it quickly took down because of copyright concerns. That may not be the only reason, though. Another issue with the feature is that it could also be a tool for stalking.  But Couch says Google can get around such privacy concerns if people opt in like they do with Foursquare check-ins. And one motivation to opt in would be discounts. Imagine, for instance, if you get a third meal free if you bring two friends. As the Guinness example shows, such offers can be triggered by a search for directions. The result would be something of an ideal scenario for advertisers — getting in front of a consumer just as they're ready to buy your product or a rival product. Personalized Ads In their current incarnation, billboards are a blunt instrument. An ad for a female-skewing product like makeup will alienate about 50% of the population. An ad in a high-traffic area like an airport is likely to be aimed at a broad group of people who fit under the heading of ""business traveler"" even though you don't fit that description.  But what if the ads you saw were different than the person next to you? What if, like the ads you see online, they are based on a composite sketch of you created by all the searches you've done and the websites you've visited? In other words, what if you looked up and instead of seeing an ad for something you would never buy — like women's shoes — you saw an ad reminding you of that Amazon search you did a few days ago? Dave Elchoness, co-founder and CEO of Tagwhat, takes the idea further: ""You can even monetize vertical,"" he says. ""You'd see something different if you look up at a 45-degree angle than you would if you look straight up."" (As Havens has previously pointed out, there's currently no restriction on such ""virtual air rights;"" two or more brands can occupy the same space, though what you'll see depends on who you are and what technology you're using.)  Elchoness acknowledges that these kind of literally in-your-face ads may not appeal to everyone. ""With the current approach, you can sort of ignore a banner ad,"" he says. Another obstacle is that behavioral data. Apple's iOS doesn't allow for tracking of third-party cookies, meaning that an advertiser can't follow your path on the web. Google allows for third-party tracking, but the technology is new and advertisers are still just figuring it out. Still, consumers might decide that they don't mind being tracked if they're served up more relevant ads. On the other hand, they might find the whole thing creepy.  Where does this leave traditional billboards? Likely they'd remain as they are for some time, just as newspapers coexist with the web. However, over time, they'd become less relevant and effective. After all, you don't need a physical billboard to project the AR ads that Elchoness refers to.  Game-ification of Everyday Life It's one thing to play Mario Bros., but what about living it? ""What if you were Mario?"" asks Couch. In this scenario, you might be walking down the street when you get an invitation to open a box or grab a medallion. Doing either allows you to earn points in a game to, say, get a free coffee at the Seattle's Best coffee shop, which happens to be just a few feet away. As far-fetched as this may seem, Cachetown, a unit of Candy Lab, is already offering such games. However, with those you have to use your smartphone or tablet. The video below outlines how such programs work. Though it takes creative license at one point and lets the girl see the objects without a phone, tablet or Google Glass, Couch says that with Google Glass it would be pretty much the same. ""Take the tablet out of that girl's hand and have [Google Glass] on her face. How much more fun would that be?""  Other Possibilities One interesting Google Glass feature is the ability to record what you're seeing. You can shoot video with your smartphone too, of course, but recording from your eyes' vantage point will conceivably result in more professional-looking videos. So not surprisingly, Vivian Rosenthal, the founder and CEO of GoldRun, another AR firm, sees a day in which user-generated videos become more common and more useful. One possibility is that instead of a Sponsored Story, you can shoot a quick video of yourself raving about that new Toyota you bought, which can be distributed to your Facebook friends in return for a discount. (This is assuming that a rival, Facebook-friendly alternative to Google Glass emerges. Another possibility is that Google introduces a similar product for Google Plus.)  Havens also thinks that Google Glass could redefine the focus group. Instead of an antiseptic environment with two-way mirrors, Havens pictures the following vision: You and your friends are talking about that hot new HBO series. Remembering an offer you got from HBO, you ask if you can record the conversation. In return, you say, everyone will get DVD copies of the show's first season.  Of course, that treads into some murky waters. Is this still a real conversation? Are you using your friends for marketing purposes? But just as Google Glass could eventually blur the line between reality and the augmented kind, it can also ironically provide less transparency between marketing and your natural behavior. In short, once you look through Google Glass, you may never see things the same again.  Photo via Kimihiro Hoshino/AFP/Getty Images "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/google-transparency-report/,Google: Police Requests for User Data Up 70% Since 2009,"Global law enforcement requests for Google user data are up more than 70% since 2009, the company said in a blog post revealing its latest Transparency Report posted Wednesday. Google has also for the first time in this edition of its report broken down the types of legal mechanisms used by U.S. law enforcement in requesting Google user data.  From July through December of 2012, the company received a total of 8,438 user data requests in the United States, up 6% from the first half of 2012, for about 14,868 users, down 9% from the first half of 2012.  Electronic Communications Protection Act subpoenas accounted for 68% of those requests, which do not require a judge. ECPA warrants, which do require a judge and are issued when there is probable cause that user data is related to some crime, were behind 22% of requests. The other 10% were assorted ECPA court orders and ""other processes that are difficult to categorize,"" per Google.  Google complied with 88% of the U.S. user data requests it received during that time period, the lowest compliance rate since it began posting that data at the end of 2010.  Globally, Google received 21,389 law enforcement requests for user data from 33,643 users or accounts during the second half of 2012. It complied with 66% of requests globally.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/google-x-phone-features/,Will the Google X Phone Be Shatter-Proof?,"Google reported its quarterly earnings yesterday, and although the company's Motorola division posted a big loss, executives pointed out that the hardware maker had a 12- to 18-month product pipeline already in place when Google acquired it in 2011. That roadmap is now nearing its end, and attention is turning to what comes after — specifically, the rumored Google X phone. Rumors of the Google X phone began last fall when the Wall Street Journal ran a piece declaring its existence, citing ""people familiar with the matter."" The Google X phone is said to be the most advanced Android hardware the company could possibly make, which will ""stand apart"" from all other phones on the market. A Google X tablet is supposedly also in the works. The specific features of such a device have been the subject of intense speculation since the rumors began. While everything about the phone remains unconfirmed, there have been some hints about what the key features of the Google X phone might be. SEE ALSO: Google X Phone: Long on Mystery, Short on Details
 There's a good chance Google X will be much more durable than the phones of today. Rumors about the phone center around the screen being bendable, similar to a prototype device Samsung unveiled at CES. The benefits of a ""bendy"" phone are questionable, but using a flexible display would result in a phone that's much more immune to shattering, unlike the relatively fragile touch screens of today. Another source points toward an ultra-durable Google phone, and that's CEO Larry Page himself. In a lengthy interview with Wired, Page strongly suggested that device durability was of strong interest to Google. ""There’s a lot of room for innovation in hardware,"" Page said. ""The phones we use now have glass that everyone worries will break if they drop the device. Five or 10 years from now, that will be different."" What other features might be on board the Google X phone? That's anyone's guess, but other rumors suggest extra-long battery life. That truly would be a breakthrough but probably less likely. Battery technology has only progressed incrementally in recent years, and big improvements are still likely years away. Fuel cells, which could power devices for weeks, are a possibility, but bring with them a host of new issues, such as supporting infrastructure. The biggest problem Google faces in mobile innovation is competition. Apple, Samsung, Nokia, HTC and Research In Motion (among others) are in a never-ending race to be the first to market with any particular problem-solving feature. Some of the rumors surrounding the Google X phone included a panorama mode and better color saturation for photos, but those features have already appeared on devices like the iPhone 5. Do you think Google X will live up to the hype? Let us know in the comments. Image courtesy of iStockphoto, Noctiluxx "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/gozi-bank-malware-indictment/,3 Charged in Bank Malware Scheme That Hit Thousands of Computers,"Three people were indicted Wednesday in New York for being behind a complex international operation that used a virus called 'Gozi' to infect thousands of computers worldwide, stealing citizens' bank information. The FBI has disclosed details of a two-and-a-half-year investigation that has led to the indictment of three Eastern Europeans: Nikita Kuzmin, Mihai Paunescu and Deniss Calovskis. The three have been charged with various counts involving bank and wire fraud, access device fraud and computer intrusion, and are facing a maximum penalty of 95, 60 and 67 years in prison, respectively. According to the FBI, Gozi ""infected at least 1 million computers worldwide and 40,000 in the U.S., and resulted in the theft or loss of tens of millions of dollars,"" and the virus even hit NASA computers. As potential evidence, the feds have been able to retrieve 51 servers in Romania as well as laptops, desktops and external hard drives. The data seized amounts to 250 terabytes — or 250 million megabytes. The criminal operation started somewhere in 2005 when Kuzmin, a Russian citizen, developed a virus named Gozi with the help of a programmer he hired to write the code. The virus was first spotted in Europe in 2007 and started infecting American computers in 2010. The malicious software, which was delivered by various means, including infected PDF files, was designed to steal bank account log-in information and send it back to a server operated by Kuzmin, who could then access the victims' bank accounts and siphon off money. Kuzmin not only designed the malware, he's also accused of marketing and distributing it through online criminal channels. Initially, according to the FBI, he rented it for a weekly fee. A customer who wanted to use Gozi would be granted access to the server for a limited time, based on the rental terms. Since he ""marketed Gozi as a rent-a-virus, Kuzmin’s customers didn’t need the level of computer savvy he and his co-conspirators had,"" reads a prepared statement by George Venizelos, the FBI's assistant director in charge of the New York field office. ""Instead of 'This Gun for Hire,' Kuzmin’s operation was 'This Virus for Hire.'""  Then, in 2009, Kuzmin started selling the source code for $50,000 and a cut of any eventual profits the customer would make. In November 2010, however, Kuzmin was arrested and started cooperating with the authorities after pleading guilty to federal charges. It was with Kuzmin's help that the FBI reached Paunescu, a Romanian citizen, and Calovskis, who is from Latvia. They have both been arrested in their respective countries and are now awaiting extradition to the U.S. Paunescu, also knowns as ""Virus,"" is accused of operating a so called bullet-proof hosting service, which provided criminals with safe IP addresses and servers that protected their anonimity. His service, the FBI notes, was used for many more malware and DDoS operations, not just Gozi. Calovskis, who went by the name ""Miami,"" was purportedly hired by Kuzmin to develop ""web injects."" His injects modified how a particular banking site would appear to a victim in order to trick them into providing even more personal information like his or her date of birth, Social Security number, and ATM card pin.

 Paunescu and Calovskis are just two of an unknown number of cooperators who worked on a complex cybercriminal operation that not only consisted in marketing the virus but also giving support to clients and updating the malware constantly to avoid detection by antiviruses. According to an FBI complaint obtained by Wired, federal officials got to Kuzmin thanks to some Jabber chats they obtained through a warrant. In one of the conversations, a user identified as Kuzmin tries to convince a client to buy his virus over a competing one. ""Take my trojan,"" he wrote. ""Mine is much cooler, it doesn’t get burned by proactives [a detection method used by antivirus software] and works with win7 and vista.” In other chats, he refers to personal information like the car he's using, his bank account and his email address, which led authorities to his social media profile on the Russian website Youdo.ru and helped them confirm his identity. In a chat on Nov. 19, 2010, Kuzmin revealed a trip to Thailand, after which he would go ""somewhere else and get lost.” Authorities were later able to spot him in the States by reviewing U.S. immigration and customs records. That's when he was arrested in San Francisco.  Photo courtesy of iStockphoto, Goldmund. "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/indiana-court-rules-banning-sex-offenders-from-facebook-unconstitutional/,Court Rules That Banning Sex Offenders From Facebook is Unconstitutional,"Banning sex offenders from using social media networks like Facebook is unconstitutional, according to a federal court.  The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago struck down an Indiana law passed in 2008 that prohibited certain sex offenders from accessing and using social media networks, if those sites were used by minors. The judges held that such a prohibition was a ""blanket ban"" that went too far by restricting free speech.  The law ""broadly prohibits substantial protected speech rather than specifically targeting the evil of improper communications to minors,"" the judges wrote in the ruling, according to the Associated Press. ""The goal of deterrence does not license the state to restrict far more speech than necessary to target the prospective harm."" A federal judge previously upheld the law, ruling that it was ""narrowly tailored"" enough that it didn't infringe on the first amendment rights of those convicted of sex offenses. The law was initially challenged by an Indiana resident who claimed it would restrict his free speech rights, forbid him from checking his children's online accounts, advertise his business, and connect with friends and family.  The decision was applauded by Hanni Fakhoury, an attorney with the online rights advocacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation. Fakhoury noted in these cases, even if there are ""very compelling interests in protecting children,"" sometimes the law goes too far. ""The real problem is the methods by which governments are doing it to kind of protect minors from online predators, if you will, are far far far too expansive and not really narrowly tailored to the purpose that they're ostensibly enacting these laws for,” he told Mashable.   The Indiana law tackles the same issues as California's Proposition 35. The Californians Against Sexual Exploitation Act required anyone who is registered as sex offender — which includes those convicted of minor offenses like indecent exposure — to turn over to law enforcement all their online identities, basically prohibiting them from posting online anonymously or with a pseudonym. On January 12, a judge halted the enforcement of the law, considering it too broad. ""The government may not regulate expression in such a manner that a substantial portion of the burden on speech does not serve to advance its goals,” he wrote. ""I think it's good that judges are being kind of critical with what's going on and saying that governments need to really dig in and do some work and narrowly tailor these types of laws so that they don't enact blanket prohibition that prohibit a whole class of people from being able to speak online,” said Fakhoury, who worked on the California case on behalf of the EFF and has also penned an op-ed on Wired, explaining why they are defending the online free speech rights of sex offenders.  The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the suit along with the Indiana resident, argued that even though the rest of the web would be accessible to these type of sex offenders, social media networks are now indispensable in our digital lives, and that the ban would prevent them from using Facebook or other websites for legitimate uses.  ""Indiana already has a law on the books that prohibits inappropriate sexual contacts with children,"" including penalties for online activities, the ACLU legal director Ken Falk told the Associated Press. ""This law sought to criminalize completely innocent conduct that has nothing to do with children."" Apart from the laws in Indiana and California, other states like Nebraska and Louisiana have tried to enact similar regulations and have already encountered opposition in the courts. The one in Nebraska was partially struck down last October, while in Louisiana, the legislators had to pass a narrower statute.  ""There is certainly a growing chorus of concern over the constitutional problems of these type of laws,"" Fakhoury said.  SEE ALSO: Imprisoned Sex Offenders Banned From Facebook

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/infrascanner-detects-brain-trauma/,Infrascanner Detects Brain Trauma At the Scene of Accidents," A portable wand that uses Near-Infrared (NIR) technology can detect hemorrhaging in the brain and help medical professionals assess if a person needs a CT scan or surgery.  The Infrascanner Model 2000 looks like a large remote control and can be held against the head to determine if a person might have brain hemorrhaging. The device can spot the difference between normal brain tissue and hematomas using infrared light absorption. It doesn't take the place of CT scans, but can be used to monitor head trauma patients or assess people at the scene of an accident.  The device was recently approved by the FDA for military and civilian use.  SEE ALSO: Microchips Repair Brain Damage in Rats [VIDEO]  The company suggests it could be used for monitoring hospital patients with head injuries; people intoxicated with drugs or alcohol; or screening players of sports like boxing, football, soccer and rugby, where head injuries might occur.  The Infrascanner Model 2000 was designed like the previous model, the Infrascanner Model 1000, with specifications from the U.S. Marine Corps. The new model includes a few key changes including being powered by two AA batteries in addition to a rechargeable battery pack, plus it's more durable. Each year 1.5 million people sustain a new traumatic brain injury, and more than 5 million Americans live with long-term disability due to traumatic brain injury, notes the National Institutes of Health.    Do you think the Infrascanner Model 2000 could save lives if used at the scene of an accident? Tell us in the comments.  Photo courtesy of iStockphoto, svedoliver  "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/intel-stops-making-motherboards/,Intel to Desktop PC: No Motherboards for You!,"Intel will stop making desktop PC motherboards after the next generation of its chip technology arrives, the company has announced. The fourth-generation Core processors, codenamed ""Haswell,"" will be the last line of chips for which Intel will build desktop motherboards, and it will fully wind down the business over the next three years. To clarify, Intel is halting the manufacturing of motherboards — the component of a PC that holds the CPU, RAM and connectivity elements — not desktop processors themselves. Various manufacturers — such as Asus and Gigabyte — will continue to make desktop motherboards, AnandTech reports, and enthusiasts who build their own PCs already have many third-party suppliers to choose from. Still, the move can only be interpreted as an acknowledgment that desktop PCs are dying off (a key trend my colleague Lance Ulanoff predicted for 2013). The desktop market has been declining for years, mirroring the shrinking of the overall PC market as consumers shift their digital lives to smartphones and tablets. SEE ALSO: Google: Desktops Will Be Irrelevant in Three Years' Time
 However, recent numbers show demand for desktop computers hasn't declined as fast as the demand for PCs in general, according to reports from research groups Gartner and NPD. The desktop market is likely being helped by the rise of all-in-one designs such as Apple's iMac. Also, the laptop market has been hurt by the implosion of netbooks, the mild demand for ultra-thin designs and the public's lukewarm reaction to Windows 8. Besides weak desktop-PC demand, Intel has other reasons for halting its desktop motherboard business. The trend in chip design — particularly at Intel — is toward system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs, with the CPU, RAM and graphics all on one chip. In addition, the market for motherboards has consolidated to a few very competent manufacturers, and the need for Intel to introduce a ""reference"" design is less necessary. Finally, there's the most obvious reason: The margins are thin on the products, and it's difficult to make money on them. As Intel gears up to expand its presence on mobile devices with its Atom processors, getting out of low-performing businesses should improve its focus. Will you miss Intel's desktop PC motherboards?

Long before Jim Harbaugh became head coach of the San Francisco 49ers and his rah-rah locker room slogan became an unavoidable catchphrase here in the Bay Area, the coach delivered a motivational pep talk to a different group of young men — characters from the show Saved by the Bell: The New Class. Harbaugh was quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts when he appeared in the 1996 episode playing himself as an older, cooler cousin of the legendary Screech.  The clip above first hit YouTube in early December, but is definitely worth sharing again as Jim prepares to face off against older brother John — head coach of the Baltimore Ravens — in Super Bowl XLVII on Feb. 3.  Harbaugh told the San Francisco Chronicle that meeting ol' Screech was a seminal lifetime moment that has been hard equal.  ""It’s a highlight,"" he said. ""Everything’s been downhill since then.” Somehow, we suspect a Super Bowl win in two weeks would bump Screech down the list.  How would you rate Harbaugh's performance? Let us know in the comments.

Timberlake had teased a musical comeback this month only several days before releasing the song on iTunes on the same night as the Golden Globes.  In conjunction with the release, he put this letter on Countdown.JustinTimberlake.com: I hope this gets to you the right way. It's the only way I know to do it. Some people may criticize me for the last 3 days. But it was fun, right?? Right?!?! Besides, I'd rather speak directly to all of you. And, who can knock me for having a little bit of fun with it? Well... No more teasing. Although, it was A LOT of fun. (Did I mention that I'm having fun with this?? Ha!) *Makes a serious face* This year is an exciting one for me. As you probably have heard through the ""grapevine,"" I'm gearing up for a big 2013. Back in June of last year, I quietly started working on what is now, my next journey with that thing I love called MUSIC. The inspiration for this really came out of the blue and to be honest, I didn't expect anything out of it. I just went into the studio and started playing around with some sounds and songs. It was probably the best time I've had in my career... Just creating with no rules and/or end goal in mind and really enjoying the process. What I came up with is something I couldn't be more excited about! It is full of inspiration that I grew up listening to and some newfound muses that I've discovered along the way. I'm calling it ""The 20/20 Experience,"" and it's coming out this year. I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed making it. That's all I'm giving you for now... I know, I know!

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/labor-simulation-men-cry/,Men Brought to Tears During 'Going Into Labor' Simulation," I stubbed my toe last week. It really hurt. There wasn't any blood or broken skin that I could see — but, rest assured, I cursed out the edge of that coffee table with all the energy I could muster. Everyone handles pain in different ways. Some, ahem, cringe when running into furniture; others take punches to the face without even flinching. But there's one type of pain, above all else, that's inarguably the worst: giving birth. Mothers understand it, men never will. And that's that. Simple. Dennis Storm and Valerio Zeno, hosts of the Dutch TV show Guinea Pigs, weren't quite buying that idea. The pair underwent an electro-simulation of labor pains to see for themselves what it felt like. Both men had four electrodes strapped to their abdomens and, over a two-hour period, were administered intermittent electrical shocks to simulate contractions.  The result? Not so pretty. At first, the two are able to laugh off the initial pains. Around the 4:30 mark, though, the agony sets in.  In the end, both seem to have changed their minds. ""It was torture for me,"" says an exhausted-looking Zeno. ""I don't know if I dare make my wife pregnant.""      SEE ALSO: This Is the Best Soda Drinking Simulator You'll Play All Week

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/london-tube-contactless-payment/,"London Tube Has 'Contactless' Payments, Why Don't We?","London's transit agency, Transportation for London, announced the rollout of contactless credit card readers on all of the city's 8,500 buses last month, allowing riders to charge their bus fare directly to their bank accounts.  Previously, Londoners had the option of paying a discounted fare with a prepaid Oyster card or handing over an extra pound and paying in cash. Now, anyone with one of Britain's 30 million contactless credit cards can avoid being one of the daily 36,000 people who ""[dash] to board a bus only to discover that [their] Oyster card has run out of credit"" and then have to ""scrabble for change"" and pay a higher fare, as London's Mayor Boris Johnson press release explained. Transportation for London expects that Londoners will be able to use this technology on the underground Tube and aboveground trams by the end of 2013. In theory, this is exciting news for London commuters who loathe change-scrabbling, but even more so for credit card companies, who will now ostensibly have access to data about where and when people are traveling to different parts of the city. In practice, however, this will be an interesting test case for the future of contactless payments in public transportation systems, particularly in the U.S.  Will public transit riders really use contactless credit cards enough to meaningfully change the way that people pay for their transportation? And what can and will credit card companies do with the resulting data? To answer these questions, a quick primer in credit-card speak is necessary. First, because contactless credit cards don't require a pin number or signature — or even the time it takes to remove the card from a wallet — the ""contactless"" part is only usable for small purchases: The limit is £20 in the UK and $20 in the U.S. Each card has an embedded chip which detects card readers without having to be tapped or swiped, as long as they are only one or two inches away.  The chip technology that enables contactless purchases was created as part of a wider effort by Eurocard, Mastercard, and Visa to do away with magnetic strip credit cards; according to proponents of the technology, ""EMV"" chip-based cards are more secure than regular cards and could eventually carry multiple applications, like having a credit and debit card function on one card. (The broader set of 'contactless' technologies fall into the realm of near-field communication, often abbreviated as NFC.) Figuring out how widely used contactless cards is tough. According to the UK Card Association, more than 30 million contactless credit cards had been issued in the country by the end of September 2012, and, not counting London's 8,500 newly-updated buses, more than 135,000 payment terminals have been installed. A report released in May by an independent research firm, though, indicated that only 5% of Brits have ever made a contactless payment, and millions of credit card users were ""unsure"" about whether their card had the technology.  Though Visa tried to spark the contactless revolution during the 2012 Summer Olympics, the results were limp: The company admitted that only 150,000 purchases had been made with contactless cards during the Games. Moreover, according to a survey conducted by an ATM operating company, 55% of Brits indicated that payment hiccups during the 2012 Games made them less likely to support a ""cashless economy,"" which is exactly the future that many contactless card proponents envision.  In the United States, the story of contactless credit cards has unfolded a bit differently, and it doesn't seem likely that New York or D.C. are going to roll out direct credit card payments on buses or underground rail systems any time soon.  Card companies and banks have introduced test markets for contactless cards in a few areas, like New York City, Atlanta and Denver, and card companies report that millions of cards with contactless capabilities have been issued. But of the more than 5 million businesses in the United States, only 30,000 have the equipment required to accept contactless payments.  While the penetration of EMV chip technology has been slow in Europe, it has been even slower in the United States, and over the past year or so, almost every major credit card company has released an official plan of action for jumpstarting the use of the technology. The bright future credit card companies see in contactless payments could be cut short by the rapidly developing mobile payments market, which tech gurus like Marc Andreessen see as a huge area for future growth.  In countries outside of the U.S., this has certainly been the case: In just four years, 80% of people in Kenya started using mobile payments services, provided mostly by phone companies — how's that for growth? According to the Communications Commission of Kenya, the number of mobile payments users has continued to rise in large part because of the lack of financial services in the country, providing an alternative form of banking for lower-income Kenyans.   Here in the U.S., companies like Square, which sells a unique card reader that can automatically detect and take payments from any mobile device with its app, have also been making a splash in the market, albeit not in Kenyan proportions. In November, Square announced via Twitter that it now sees more than $10 billion dollars in transactions being made through the service. That does not even include the transactions that will be generated thanks to the company's new deal with Starbucks. But for now, the idea that contactless payments would become mainstream enough to be used for public transportation is still far-fetched. Although London officials have tested out mobile payment prototypes for the underground several times, none have taken hold. The most recent effort was rejected because the NFC technology it used was deemed too slow.   In the mobile gadgets world, debates have raged about NFC, which uses radio waves to let devices — like two smart phones, or, potentially, a smart phone and a digital cash register of some sort — communicate instantly. Critics say the technology does not improve efficiency enough to gain widespread popularity, and unless it is used in a broad ecosystem of consumers and businesses, it won't make noticeable changes in the mobile payments space.   Perhaps there's a future for Silicon Valley companies like Square in San Francisco's public transportation system (which happens to be in particular need of technology overhaul), but it's a future that will likely take a long time to come. In the fall of 2011, New Jersey Transit became one of the first transit authorities in the U.S. to accept Google Wallet and other forms of contactless payment at certain bus stations, which expanded to the Port Authority in 2012.  According to a spokesperson, they see around 10,000 contactless ""taps"" per month, which could be payments for single or multi-fare transactions. But across 12 rail lines, 260 bus routes and three light rail systems, NJ Transit serves just under 900,000 customers per day. While they are in ""testing phases related to contactless payments,"" a full-scale roll-out is a distant possibility. (Excitingly, Boston has just introduced a new system of mobile ticketing.) Regardless of the path that U.S. mass transit systems ultimately take to make their payment systems more efficient, those changes seem to be in everyone's best interest. In a perfect world, in which a contactless or mobile payments ecosystem has been well-established, these kinds of payment systems would significantly decrease the inefficiencies of current fare systems. Costs associated with operations like producing and maintaining card machines and even transporting and counting hundreds of thousands of coins every day would be virtually eliminated. And what might make capturing those efficiencies more attractive? The amount of data that could be gathered and directed toward targeted marketing is staggering. According to 2011 data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the average public transportation user spends 95.4 minutes commuting every day, and this represents only a percentage of the total time Americans spend on buses, trains and underground rail.  If even a small chunk of riders started using contactless cards or mobile payments to pay for the bus, credit card companies or start-ups like Square would gain access to daily information about when and where their customers are traveling. Harnessed correctly, this kind of data could be used to tailor advertising to fit a subway rider's morning commute perfectly — who wouldn't use a coupon for coffee at the Cosi near Dupont Circle if it popped up on their phone as they exited the metro?   Of course, this kind of ""secondary use"" of consumer data raises red flags about privacy concerns. In some ways, the interests of a private credit card or mobile payments company would be aligned with that of the bus rider. In a perfect world, companies could provide riders with more tailored and relevant information (i.e. advertising) about the world around them. Then, again, the world of targeted marketing hasn't always been perfect. One can imagine ways in which uses for this kind of location data would not align company and consumer interests, which is somewhat more problematic.  In a conversation with Ryan Calo, a law professor at the University of Washington and privacy expert, he pointed out that if companies use information about how people ride public transportation against them, say to create a system of price discrimination so that coffee at Cosi is more expensive during the hours of the bleary-eyed commute, that would constitute a kind of harm to the consumer.   The online world ""is a mediated environment, in that there's a layer between what you do and your experience,"" Calo said. But when this kind of data use ""begins to spread to the offline world...[it] blurs the distinction that we have between the online world and the brick and mortar world.""  This highlights the important distinction between ""push"" versus ""pull"" data transactions, to borrow email terms for a moment. If we automatically give up ever more information about our location and traveling habits every time we ride the bus, then morning commutes become just one more space in which profitable information about our private lives becomes thoughtlessly available to private companies who might not have our best interests in mind. Despite these cautions, there are responsible ways to deploy more efficient public transit payment systems, especially if consumers are aware of how their information could be used if they choose the convenience of a contactless or mobile swipe. But at this point, at least in the United States, this potential is a long way from being realized — the technology market is too fractured to support a major shift in the way we pay for the bus any time soon.

Manti Te'o continued to perpetuate the myth that he led Notre Dame to within one win of a national championship in the wake of his girlfriend's death for weeks after he found out that the woman in question didn't actually exist.  In an interview with ABC's Katie Couric, the controversial football star admitted that he learned of the deception in December but was too embarrassed to come clean.   ""Katie, put yourself in my situation,"" Te'o said.  Te'o's story of love and loss with ""Lennay Kekua"" captured the hearts and minds of hardcore and casual sports fans alike last fall, helping propagate Te'o's image as a paragon of virtue and character as he became a football superstar and Heisman Trophy contender. Last week it was revealed that Kekua was nothing but a hoax, an elaborate ""catfishing"" scam cobbled together by using images from an oblivious woman's social media profiles.  After the bizarre con was uncovered, debate raged about whether Te'o was an unwitting victim of the scam or a conniving accomplice.  He told Couric that he was legitimately in love with Kekua despite never having met her in person (though Sports Illustrated reported in the fall that the pair had first met after a game at Stanford a few years prior). He said he learned the truth in early December, just days before the Heisman Trophy ceremony, where he would be faced with intense media attention and more questions about her death. There was too much scrutiny and pressure then to come clean, he claimed.   You can watch more clips from the ABC News interview here.  Do you believe Te'o?

Example: Remember when trolls were in doll form with hot pink hair, instead of a nickname for someone who stirs the pot on the Internet?  ""You might not remember us, but we met in the '90s,"" the ad says. ""We are members of Generation Y. As in Ying Yang, yo-yo ... life moved a little slower. Disks were square, desktop folders had personality and extra storage space was just a zipper away. There was only one social network, but most of your friends died of dysentery."" The ad comes beautifully full circle: ""The future was bright,"" it continues. ""You grew up ... so did we. Reconnect with the new Internet Explorer.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/nasa-alien-planet-archive/,NASA's Alien Planet Archive Now Open to the World,"Scientists with NASA's planet-hunting Kepler spacecraft have revamped the mission's online archive of alien worlds, opening up the database for the entire world to see. Researchers are now posting all exoplanet sightings by the Kepler observatory into a single, comprehensive website called the NASA Exoplanet Archive. Instead of going through the long planet confirmation process before making data publicly available, since December of last year, scientists have started shoveling out all the data Kepler collects into a comprehensive list. ""When we make that list, right away it goes to the archive,"" Kepler mission team member Steve Howell told SPACE.com during the 221st American Astronomical Society meeting in Long Beach, Calif., this month. ""So the day we know about the list, the archive knows about the list. And then everybody, including us, can work on that list. But that list is dynamic so if we, or a community person, makes an observation and says, 'Hey, I looked at this planet candidate but it's really an eclipsing binary,' then that entry in the archive will be changed."" The archive has information about the size, orbital period and other metrics of any possible planet discovered and investigated by Kepler. SEE ALSO: Gallery: A World of Kepler Planets
 ""It's all in real time,"" Howell said. ""The sausage-making process is exposed."" Before the new archive was debuted, astronomers were already doing creative work with the data. One created a visually stunning video of every known Kepler planet candidate — 2,299 unconfirmed exoplanets at the time — orbiting one central point. The Kepler team’s new ""open"" attitude toward data release is giving everybody, not just members of the scientific community, a chance to do some hands-on scientific research by building their own experiments, Howell said. A group of high school students has already taken data from groups of planets observed by Kepler and mapped them against a map of known stars looking for a pattern. Howell doesn’t think they'll see much, but he's glad that they have the opportunity to get creative. ""The entire world can help us with this Kepler data,"" Howell said. ""I don't see any downside."" Planet Hunters, a collective of amateur astronomers, recently found 42 new alien planets using Kepler data that was publicly available prior to the launch of the new archive system. It would be difficult for Kepler scientists to get their jobs done without the help of amateur astronomers around the globe, mission researchers said. By making the exoplanet archive more accessible, it could mean that more planets are found and confirmed in shorter amounts of time than ever before. More people sifting through the wealth of data collected by Kepler means that scientists have a better chance of finding even more planets circling distant stars, Howell added. Since its launch in 2009, NASA's Kepler spacecraft has flagged more than 2,300 objects as possible alien worlds. Although only about 100 have been confirmed, scientists expect that at least 80% could be certifiable exoplanets. Currently, Kepler has entered a ""safe mode"" after researchers spotted an issue with one of the spacecraft's three reaction wheels that are responsible for orienting the telescope. The malfunction has stalled science observations, but researchers hope that the issue will be resolved by Jan. 27. Image courtesy of NASA

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/nasa-mars-exploration-film/,NASA to Premiere New Mars Exploration Film,"NASA is unveiling a new documentary film about the history of Mars exploration today to an audience in the Los Angeles area, and there's a chance the movie could eventually get distributed nationally. ""The Changing Face of Mars"" premieres tonight at 8 p.m. PST at the California Institute of Technology's Beckman Auditorium in Pasadena. Admission is free, with seating on a first-come, first-served basis. The 90-minute documentary, which was produced by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), chronicles humanity's efforts to explore the Red Planet, from the first flyby in 1965 by NASA's Mariner 4 probe to the current work being done on the Martian surface by the agency's car-size Curiosity rover. Reminders of those two bookend missions will be on display at the premiere, which will feature a full-scale Curiosity replica and the historic ""first image"" of Mars — a hand-drawn color portrait put together in 1965 using data beamed home by Mariner 4. One aim of ""The Changing Face of Mars"" is to highlight and preserve the contributions of the 1960s-era pioneers, who blazed a trail to the Red Planet that engineers at NASA and other space agencies are still following today. ""They didn't know how to build a spacecraft; it had never been done before. There was no one they could turn to to ask how to build a spacecraft,"" said writer/director/producer Blaine Baggett, who heads JPL's office of communication and education. ""So I just have a tremendous respect and appreciation for those who came before, and I'm bound and determined to capture their memories and experiences so we have them, before they're lost for good,"" Baggett told SPACE.com. ""The Changing Face of Mars"" is the fourth installment in Baggett's ongoing series ""Beginnings of the Space Age."" None of the titles are available nationally at the moment, though Baggett said discussions about a possible deal to distribute all four are underway. Baggett hopes the series includes eight or nine films eventually. ""There are four or five more films, if I can last out and they keep me here that long,"" he said. Image courtesy of NASA

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/nasa-sun-magnetic-braids/,Surprising Matter Found in Sun's Million-Degree Atmosphere,"A small NASA space telescope has revealed surprising magnetic braids of super-hot matter in the sun's outer atmosphere, a find that may explain the star's mysteriously hot corona, researchers say. The discovery, made by NASA's High-Resolution Coronal Imager, or Hi-C, also may lead to better space weather forecasts, the scientists added. ""With potential annual economic impacts of tens to hundreds of billions of dollars domestically during periods of high solar activity, accurate forecasts of the local space weather environment can possibly save billions for power systems, commercial aircraft and a number of other economic sectors,"" said study author Jonathan Cirtain, who led the Hi-C sun corona mission. Cirtain, a solar astrophysicist at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala., and his team launched the 9.5-inch (24 centimeters) telescope last July on a 10-minute flight just beyond Earth's atmosphere to study the corona, the sun's million-degree outer atmosphere. The telescope snapped 165 photos in stunning detail before parachuting back to Earth.  SEE ALSO: NASA's Hi-C Photos: Best View Ever of Sun's Corona
 The surface of the sun is unsurprisingly hot, up to 11,000 degrees Fahrenheit (6,125 degrees Celsius). Bizarrely, however, the corona — the outer atmosphere far above the sun's surface — is hotter by a thousandfold, even in the absence of solar flares. Scientists recently found that powerful magnetic waves rippling from below the sun's surface may heat the corona by 2.7 million degrees F (1.5 million degrees C). However, that alone would not account for the corona's ultra-hot temperatures. Now high-resolution images of the sun's corona support the idea of magnetic braids generating tremendous amounts of heat, possibly enough to explain the readings of up to 10.8 million degrees F (6 million degrees C). To picture these magnetic structures on the sun, ""imagine a French braid in someone's hair,"" Cirtain told SPACE.com. ""Bundles of individual hairs are wrapped about other bundles and together form a braided ensemble of hair. ""What we have observed is a bundle of magnetic fields, wrapped about several other bundles to form a magnetic bundle ensemble. The magnetic fields in this ensemble have varying lengths, and the rate of curvature along individual field lines may also vary such that some fields are very highly curved while others are less so.""  SEE ALSO: Sun Quiz: How Well Do You Know Our Star?
 These magnetic fields are physically manifested within the super-hot plasma making up the sun. For instance, very highly curved magnetic fields can take the form of coronal loops, giant arches rising from the sun. ""When a magnetic field becomes highly curved, it eventually becomes unstable,"" Cirtain said. Eventually these magnetic braids can grow unstable enough for individual magnetic field lines of force to interact within them. This phenomenon, known as reconnection, decreases the curvature of the magnetic field, releasing potentially vast amounts of energy that can heat plasma or accelerate solar flares and other massive outbursts. While astronomers have seen magnetic braids on the surface of the sun, until now they had little way to see how common the braids were in the corona. To glimpse the magnetic braids, the NASA team launched the Hi-C telescope on a sounding rocket in July. It captured images of the corona with a resolution about five times higher than previously achieved. The low-budget mission was filled with uncertainties. For instance, the mirror used in the telescope is so smooth that, across its 9.5-inch width, it deviates from perfect smoothness by only a few widths of an atom. There was every chance that mechanical stresses, temperatures changes and other factors before and during the mission could warp its surface, reducing its quality. ""We would only know if it worked once we had flown and taken the images of the sun,"" Cirtain said. ""This lack of control of the situation kept me up many nights."" The telescope captured only five minutes of video data before re-entering Earth's atmosphere. Still, that was enough to discover magnetic braids in the corona, and the amount of activity seen suggested vast amounts of energy can be released there. The researchers, who detail their findings in the Jan. 24 issue of the journal Nature, conceded it is possible the braids they saw were not bundles of magnetic fields but sets of many nested magnetic loops overlying and underlying each other. If so, they would store less energy than estimated. Even so, however, the corona would still hold 100 times the energy needed to be super-heated. ""My life for the better part of a decade went into this instrument, and seeing it work was exciting not only for me but for my family and for my close colleagues,"" Cirtain said. The researchers hope to launch their telescope in an orbital satellite to observe the corona longer. Image courtesy of NASA/SDO

Not typed, not dictated, wrote — with a pen or pencil. Yeah, we thought so. So in honor of Wednesday,  National Handwriting Day, we thought we'd provide some inspiration. First of all, why is it National Handwriting Day? It's the birthday of John Hancock, the first to sign the Declaration of Independence. His signature became so famous, as you probably have heard, that his name is now shorthand for any old person's signature. Think about how much you use the written word in your daily life. Chances are, much of your day is spent typing on a keyboard or tapping letters on a virtual keyboard while texting. Not much time to show off your lovely handwriting. In fact many of us complain our handwriting has gotten worse, due to lack of practice.  
Image courtesy of Instagram, @afinkels To celebrate the handwritten word, Moleskine, the classic notebook brand, is inviting fans to write their Facebook and Twitter status updates instead of typing them on a keyboard. 
 

Image courtesy of Instagram, @lukerizz After you uncramp your hand from writing, upload the image of your handwritten status to Instagram with the hashtag #mHDay (for Moleskine Handwriting Day). It will then get added to a gallery on the Moleskine Facebook page.
 
Take a look at these images from the gallery. If you get really inspired, why not write someone a letter or a love note? Whatever it is, make sure it's written, not typed — just for today. What will you be writing today?  Main image courtesy of Instagram, @jchangpr  "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/netflix-stock-jumps-25-percent/,Netflix Stock Jumps 25% After Adding 2 Million Domestic Streaming Subscribers,"Netflix's stock rose 25% in after-hours trading after the company beat revenue estimates for its fiscal fourth quarter and announced it added 2 million domestic streaming subscribers in the quarter. The company posted revenues of $1 billion for the quarter and earnings per share of $0.13, compared to the street's average estimate of $935 million and  $0.13, respectively. The company now claims 27 million domestic streaming subscribers. The quarter also saw an additional 1.8 million international streaming customers for a total of 10 million, though the international operation is not yet profitable. In contrast, domestic streaming turned a profit of $109 million for the quarter. DVD subscriptions continued to lose ground. About 380,000 DVD subscribers left in the quarter, bringing the total to 8.2 million. That's a far cry from the 11 million DVD subscriptions Netflix claimed in the fourth quarter.  The company claimed it got a boost towards the end of the year. ""Our holiday season was particularly strong, driven by consumers buying new electronic devices, including tablets and smart TVs,"" CEO Reed Hastings and CFO David Wells wrote in a letter to shareholders.    Making a case for Netflix's viability in the face of competition from Amazon, Hulu and Redbox, they noted that of Netflix's top 100 TV shows and top 100 movies, Amazon had just 73. Hulu, meanwhile, had 27. Redbox had 12. The two were also optimistic about the current quarter, which will see the debut of House of Cards, an original series. Financially, the company predicts a ""relatively flat"" increase in its operating profit in the fiscal first quarter.  Image courtesy of Flickr, Matt Perreault "

One man in New Zealand clearly doesn't share the sentiment, since he's putting out a nationwide call to eradicate cats. Maybe he's just never had his heart melt at the sight of Maru in a box.

New Zealand has the most cat owners in the world with 1.419 million Kiwi kitties, says a study by the country's Companion Animal Council. As a result of the large numbers, the cats pose a threat to native birds and have already contributed to the extinction of nine species on the island.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/old-school-brands-still-exist/,4 Old-School Brands You Didn't Know Still Existed,"When news broke this week that one of the original developers of video games was filing for bankruptcy, it left many asking the same question: ""Atari still exists?""  Founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, Atari was responsible for creating a number of legendary video game franchises, including ""Pong"" and ""Asteroids."" In 1976, the company was sold to Warner Communications for a reported $28 million. Under Warner Communications, Atari expanded its offerings to include personal computers.  But by 1983, Atari began to suffer as a rash of video game competitors began to flood the market. Over the next 25 years, the company would be sold another three times, the final time being in 2008 to Infogrames, Inc.  Today, Atari specializes in online gaming through a multitude of platforms including browsers, Facebook and digital downloads. In addition, the company now develops and distributes interactive entertainment for video game consoles from Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony. The bankruptcy filing is an effort by Atari to break away from its parent company Atari S.A., formerly known as Infogrames, Inc. Like Atari, there are a number of other businesses that the masses have long left for dead, but actually still exist.  In the 1970s and 1980s, it was hard to drive anywhere in the northeastern United States without passing a Roy Rogers restaurant. Named for the popular cowboy actor, Roy Rogers opened its first location in 1968. The chain, launched by the Marriott Corporation, quickly gained a following for its roast beef sandwiches, fried chicken and hamburgers.  By 1990, the chain had grown to nearly 900 locations, most of which were in the northeast and mid-Atlantic regions. That same year, Marriott sold the restaurant chain to competitor Hardee's, hich attempted to convert nearly a quarter of the Roy Rogers locations to the Hardee's restaurant chain. A customer outcry, however, forced Hardee's to change the restaurants back to the Roy Rogers brand. Over the next several years, Hardees would sell all the Roy Rogers restaurants to a variety of chains, including McDonald's and Wendy's.  By 1996, the chain had dwindled to fewer than 150 locations, all of which were being run by franchisees. In 1998, the Roy Rogers chain was sold to the Plamondon Companies, which remains its owner today. While only about 50 Roy Rogers restaurants remain today — all of them located in Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia — the company is starting to grow again.  Within the last three months, the company has opened two new restaurants and announced plans for another. Few companies rose to prominence as quickly as computer manufacturer Compaq did in the 1980s and 1990s. Founded in 1982, Compaq quickly became the largest seller of both personal and laptop computers. The company sold its first desktop computer, the Compaq Deskpro, in 1984, and 10 years later overtook IBM as the largest PC maker in the world.  As a way to diversify, Compaq began acquiring other computer companies, including Tandem Computer Incorporated and Digital Corporation. That proved to be the computer giant's downfall. The acquisitions began bringing down the value of the company, and by 2001, Compaq had been replaced by Dell as the world's largest PC maker. As the company's outlook worsened, it eventually agreed to a $21 billion merger with competitor Hewlett-Packard Corporation in 2002.  While HP has continued to use the Compaq brand name over the past decade, it announced late last year that it plans to change how it uses it. Beginning later this year, the Compaq brand will be used solely for basic computing products at entry-level pricing.  Before Diet Coke and Pepsi ruled the diet soda landscape, TaB was the drink of choice for weight-conscious consumers. The drink, first introduced in 1963 by Coca-Cola, was the first sugar-free offering for the soda pop giant, and was wildly popular until the early 1980s. Over the years,TaB has been reformulated several times — most notably in 1969, when it stopped using the artificial sweetener cyclamate.  The drink spawned several other versions of the diet soft drink, such as TaB Lemon Lime, TaB Orange and TaB Clear. The drink's downfall began in 1982 after Diet Coke was unveiled. While the diet soda may be difficult to find now, it has not vanished altogether. A dedicated group of TaB drinkers around the country is keeping the brand alive. In 2008, Coca-Cola sold more than 3 million cases of TaB, according to Beverage Digest. Made famous by its orange roofs, Howard Johnson's restaurants used to be a staple across the country. Founded in 1925 by Howard Dearing Johnson, the restaurant chain started out as a drugstore/ice cream parlor. Four years later, the first Howard Johnson's restaurant was opened, specializing in fried clams and broiled catfish.  By 1935, the chain had expanded to more than 40 franchise locations. Just 10 years after the first locations opened, HoJo's — as it was affectionately known — expanded to more than 100 restaurants up and down the eastern seaboard, and by the 1960s, the chain was taking in more money than competitors like McDonald's and Burger King and had expanded to include hotels.  After Johnson died in 1972, the restaurant chain was bought and sold a handful of times. In 1985, it was purchased by the Marriott Corporation, which immediately sold the franchise-owned restaurants and hotels. Over the next several years, Marriott would convert many of the Howard Johnson's restaurants to other brands, until the chain became virtually nonexistent.  While still operating today, the chain appears to be on its last leg. Just two Howard Johnson's — one in Lake Placid, N.Y. and the other in Bangor, Maine — are still open today.

The watch works in conjunction with your smartphone, making it easy to see who is calling, control your music and receive notifications. Even better, app developers can build Pebble support into their apps, extending the watch's capabilities even more. SEE ALSO: Hands On With Pebble, the Internet's Favorite Smart Watch On its Kickstarter blog, the Pebble team shared the latest status on shipping and mass production. Pebble says that while it is working on adding shipment tracking to its account fulfillment page, it isn't there yet. Therefore, the company implores users not to start emailing about shipment tracking.  Today, less than 500 units will be shipped out from the factory, with more units to follow soon. Pebble has created a humorous IsPebbleShipping.com website to keep users connected. On the app front, the Pebble Android app will be live in Google Play on Jan. 24. The iOS app is still in review. If users get Pebble before the app hits the App Store, they'll still be able to receive notifications and music, but they won't be able to upgrade the PebbleOS or install watch faces.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/privacy-visor-face-recognition/,Privacy Visor Confuses Face Recognition Camera,"""Hiding behind your glasses"" just took on a whole new meaning. At Tokyo's National Institute of Informatics, Isao Echizen, an associate professor in the Digital Content and Media Sciences Research Division, unveiled a privacy visor — a set of glasses that prevents cameras with face-recognition software from recognizing you. Echizen designed the glasses with near-infrared LEDs placed around the eyes and the bridge of the nose, two areas that computers use to pick out faces. Near-infrared is invisible to people, but many cameras can pick it up. The lights add digital ""noise"" to the image and when the computer tries to match the image with ones in a database, it gets confused and is unable to complete a match. SEE ALSO: Stealth Clothing Averts Government Snoopers
 Echizen told BBC News that the purpose is to protect people from being tagged and identified in photographs without their knowledge. The EyeSee mannequins, for example, use face recognition software to log when shoppers come in and build a database of people’s age, gender or race. At the same time, he didn’t want to run into the problem of wearing a mask, which protects privacy but outside of 18th century Venetian masquerade balls, is considered a bit unusual. Makeup could also fool face recognition software, as demonstrated with the CV Dazzle project, but that too could be problematic, since the designs are a bit outré. Along with artist Adam Harvey’s stealth hoodie, these glasses are yet another indication that people are thinking more carefully about privacy — or the lack thereof — in a connected world.

Besides worldwide fame, a $500,000 bonus and a benchmark win in her young career, what did Stephens hope to get out of the stunning victory? ""I hope to have a lot more Twitter followers,"" she said in a televised interview after the match. Wish granted — and then some. Stephens had about 17,000 followers going into the match.

Ironically, Hazard's Wikipedia page claims his ""calm and cool demeanor on the field has been cited as one of his best attributes.""  Check out the video above to see the astonishing act of aggression for yourself.  UPDATE: News reports have named the kicked ballboy as Charlie Morgan.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/social-media-your-next-job-infographic/,How Social Media Could Land You Your Next Job,"We've all heard plenty about how your social-media footprint could cost you that dream job or become a massive distraction at work — but did you know social media also might just be the key to getting hired?  More and more, job hirers and recruiters scour social sites such as LinkedIn and Twitter to find new talent and learn about prospective employees. Here's the great thing about that: By and large, you control what your online presence looks like and includes.  But that doesn't only mean thinking twice about photos you post and links you share. The term ""social resume"" is beginning to gain traction, and refers to digital enhancements to the traditional paper or PDF curriculum vitae.  LinkedIn is likely the first social-resume tool that comes to mind, but other sites such as Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr can be just as helpful. There are also services such as ResumeSocial, VisualCV and Razume that offer more options for job seekers.  What can a social resume offer that the old variety can't? Links to past work, enhanced networking opportunities and instant feedback from recruiters and other job seekers, for starters.  The following infographic from OnlineColleges.com takes a deeper dive into the many benefits of properly leveraging social media in your job search.

Video courtesy of NowThisNews Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday the U.S. State Department is actively countering online propaganda posted by terrorists groups such as al-Qaeda by posting videos and other content of its own. Clinton's comments about the digital propaganda duel came during her testimony to the House of Representatives regarding the September 2012 attack on an American consolate in Benghazi, Libya. Clinton's full comments (which you can also view in the video above): ""Social media is a great tool. We've begun trying to use it much more in the State Department — and not to communicate with just leaders and officials but really to get down ... into the grassroots. I started two organizations to deal with countering violent extremism. One a new operation inside the State Department that is stafffed with inter-agency experts. I'm not saying anything that's classified, but it's beginning to try to respond to al-Qaeda and other jihadist propaganda. So if they put up a video which talks about how terrible Americans are, we put up a video which talks about how terrible they are. We're trying to meet them in the media channels that they are communicating with people.""
 It was initially thought that an anti-Islam YouTube video sparked the deadly attack last year which claimed four American lives, including that of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. However, it later became clear the attack was an organized operation conducted by terrorists. Photo via Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/steve-jobs-patent-lawsuit-no-hire/,Steve Jobs Once Threatened to Sue Palm Over Employee Poaching,"Steve Jobs once threatened its then-competitor Palm with a patent lawsuit if the company's CEO didn't stop poaching Apple employees, according to a newly surfaced court filing.  The filing, which was made public on Tuesday, detailed how Jobs once proposed an agreement for Apple and Palm to not hire away each other's employees, and if terms weren't met, he would file a patent lawsuit.  The filing was brought on by five workers against Apple, Google, Intel and others for an alleged conspiracy to remove the competition's employees, according to a Reuters report. ""In 2007, I received a call from Steve Jobs, the Chief Executive Officer of Apple,"" former Palm CEO Edward Colligan said in a sworn statement. ""In the months before the call, several employees had moved between the two companies. On the call, Mr. Jobs expressed concern about employees being hired away from Apple by Palm."" SEE ALSO: Rumor: Apple to Launch an iPhone With a 4.8-Inch Screen in 2013
 ""As a solution, Mr. Jobs proposed an arrangement between Palm and Apple by which neither company would hire the other's employees, including high tech employees,"" he continued. ""Mr. Jobs also suggested that if Palm did not agree to such an arrangement, Palm could face lawsuits alleging infringements of Apple's many patents."" Colligan said he ""did not agree to Mr. Jobs's proposal"" and instead, responded with an email, calling it ""wrong"" and ""illegal."" ""Your proposal that we agree that neither company will hire the other's employees, regardless of the individual's desires, is not only wrong, it is likely illegal,"" wrote Colligan, as shown in the filing. ""I know it's difficult when a respected employee decides to leave the company for a new challenge, but, as you said in our call, 'This is America.' We can't dictate where someone will work, nor should we try.""  He also said Palm could also respond with a patent legal action if Jobs were to proceed. But Jobs' response, also revealed in the filing, showed he wasn't worried about the counter-threat: ""We are not concerned about them at all. My advice to you is to take a look at our patent portfolio before you make a decision."" He also responded to other points: ""It is not just a matter of our employees deciding they want to join Palm,"" Jobs wrote. ""They are being actively recruited using knowledge supplied by [employees], with [one] personally participating in the recruiting process. We must do whatever we can to stop this.  I'm sure you realize the asymmetry in the financial resources of our respective companies when you say: 'We will both just end up paying a lot of lawyers a lot of money.'"" Although the documents were previously kept private, California U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh rejected parts of the continued request from the tech companies during an ongoing civil case, which is why these details have now surfaced.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/sundance-reelhouse/,Sundance Filmmakers Can Self-Distribute Films Online After Festival,"The Sundance Film Festival, which kicked off last week in Park City, Utah, has long been one of the go-to events for filmmakers hoping to get their projects noticed by some of the industry's top players.  This year, the institute announced its partnership with an online video platform called Reelhouse, which filmmakers from the event can use to self-distribute their work online.  Reelhouse CEO Will Mainguy said the partnership is a natural fit for emerging artists and audiences alike.  ""We're looking forward to this [partnership] being the spearhead of changing the industry's awareness of successful ways to distribute and collect film,"" he told Mashable. ""If you look at the open marketplaces for apps, games, books and funding, they've all done extremely well — what's been missing all along is that same idea for quality video.""    Reelhouse is similar to other open platforms such as Brightcove and Kaltura. Their selling point is ""stories only"" — so any type of creative storytelling, either as a full-length feature or 10-minute documentary, is fair game.    The partnership will pair Reelhouse with Sundance’s Artist Services, a branch of the Institute that helps provide resources to artists through the entire independent filmmaking process, from funding to distribution to advertising. The platform also offers a Kickstarter-like storefront for artists to sell physical or digital products to keep raising funds from fans.  SEE ALSO: 6 Ways to Enjoy the Sundance Film Festival From Afar
 Mainguy was hesitant to give out too many details about which artists they'll be working with. Last year, however, a documentary about Porsche customizer Magnus Walker — called Urban Outlaw — accumulated more than 400,000 views using Reelhouse's platform. Here's the trailer: 



 The self-distribution model has been used before in the entertainment field. In the past year, comedians Louis C.K., Aziz Ansari and Jim Gaffigan sold tickets for their respective stand-up tours directly through their personal sites.  ""Filmmakers can be so creative when they have close contact with their fan base. Really, that's their best resource,"" Mainguy said. ""The benefits of self-distributing, and having an open community in general, help move the process along so much faster.""  The Sundance Film Festival will wrap up on Jan. 27 with the premiere of jOBS.  What do you think? Is digital distribution the way of the future for filmmakers?

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/swipp/,Swipp Wants To Know What The World Thinks About Everything,"What if you could see at a glance what the world thought about everything: from gun control to the newest latte at Starbucks? That’s the idea behind Swipp, a tool launching Wednesday that measures sentiment on a topic in real-time, reporting back not only how people feel about something, but specific details about those feelings as well. The idea behind Swipp is fairly simple: when you’re given a term, for instance Pumpkin Spice Latte, you give it a rating between -5 and +5. Your personal rating, along with any comments you want to add, goes into the term’s overall score.  Each term has its own dashboard where you can see what its score is, what it's trending at, and take a look at the demographics of those who have rated it. You can see what percentage of swippers are male or female, as well as what country they’re in.  A graph plots the sentiment associated with the term over time, so you can see exactly when it took a turn for the worse, or when it started to get popular. You can view results for the entire world, or filtered by your friends. You can also browse what’s being swipped by trending topics, or by specific topics that interest you.  Anyone can create a Swipp based on a term of their choosing, and have their voice counted in a Swipp score. The only way to log into Swipp, however, is through Facebook Connect, so you’ll need a Facebook account to play. With its launch Wednesday, the company’s first goal is to get people using the tool, and building a repository of information that can be used to create a living picture of the planet and the people on it. Swipp’s founder see the tool ultimately being used in things like an app for The Voice, where people can vote in real-time for their favorite singer, and everyone watching can see at a glance who the front-runner might be. You’ll even be able to see details like at what note in a song viewers became a fan of a particular contestant. The tool can also be used in shopping sites, working somewhat like a review option for different products.  For instance, you might select a camera from Canon that has a +4 rating over a Nikon with a +1 rating. As a first look at the ultimate power of Swipp, the company is launching an app for the Superbowl. Called Swipper Bowl, the app focuses on players and teams for the big game, and can be used as a second-screen while watching the action. Users will be able to Swipp the teams, individual players, and even commercials during the game and see what the rest of the world thinks about the same topics in real time.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/tech-rip-offs/,7 Biggest Rip-Offs in Tech Retail,"Best Buy's Price: $1,028.98 If there was a poster child for the tech price markup, the HDMI cable would undoubtedly be it. Because they are necessary to run everything from a DVD player to an Xbox and rarely come with the hardware they're designed to serve, consumers are forced to buy HDMI cables separately. And with that comes some huge price jumps. No, you do not need to get your eyes checked: One HDMI cable costs over $1,000 at Best Buy. And, yes, you can get a similar HDMI cable for under $50 on Monoprice. To put it in perspective, when considering bulk pricing, you can buy 20 cables of the latter for the price of the former. Why one would ever need a thousand-dollar HDMI cable is a mystery, but it's a prime example of how necessary tech can be pushed to astronomical prices. Apple's Price: $29 Mac owners know how frustrating it can be to connect their products to external displays. It's a hassle to buy a separate adapter to fit a mini display, and it can also burn a significant hole in your pocket. The good news is that you can go wholesale; on the other hand, you'll kick yourself for ever buying retail. See this standard DVI to mini display adapter. If you wanted to buy it from Apple, you're looking at a $29 price point. That's not enough to raise an eyebrow, until you see it on Monoprice for less than $7. That 300% price markup is just for going to Apple -- so don't be fooled the next time you need a new adapter. B&H's Price: $79 Most top-of-the-line 3D TVs come with only two pairs of 3D glasses, so buying extra pairs for friends and family is inevitable. You can swing by B&H Online and pick up some very nice, Bluetooth-enabled active 3D glasses for $79, or pick up glasses with the exact same features at Monoprice for $34. That 200% markup could buy you another pair of glasses for free, without sacrificing any of the big features you want.
 Best Buy's Price: $30 This is another low-cost item that is often sneakily marked up by a fair margin, particularly because wireless mice are very popular for both PC and laptop owners alike. Watch out, though, what you think is a good deal can actually be a face-palming rip-off. A standard Logitech wireless optical mouse can cost almost $30 through Best Buy. At Monoprice, you can get nearly the same mouse for the low price of $8 -- 80% off the original price. Still think the former is a deal? Best Buy's Price: $22 Everyone with a printer needs printer ink, and retail companies have taken advantage by exorbitantly marking up ink cartridges across the board. It's a pain to have to go to your local copy and fax store and pay an arm and a leg just to print something important, that is, unless you know where to look. Plenty of sellers on Amazon will send you an ink cartridge for a fraction of what it costs anywhere else. For example, this HP Inkjet 27 style black ink cartridge costs nearly $22 at Best Buy, but can be procured from an independent seller for $5.50 (plus free shipping). There's no reason to go retail for your printer ink -- buy it off Amazon and save 75%. Do you have a tangled, mangled mess of cords behind your television? Want to make them more organized and maybe even sortable? Achieve a clean tech setup with just a few handy zip ties to keep everything in place -- just don't go to your nearest retailer to pick them up. At Best Buy, 8-inch black cable ties will run about $5.50. It's not enough money to really think twice, until you see that Monoprice has the same product in 100-count bags for only $1.06. That's a markup of more than 500% on black zip-ties. No one can see the back of your TV anyway -- why pay more? Staple's Price: $22 Another necessary cable begets another unnecessary price point. While the price differential isn't as drastic as the HDMI cable's, the ethernet cord can also be an easy place for retailers to jack up prices. Since many people are still hardwired into their homes (or need to be at their jobs, for security reasons), there's no avoiding purchasing an ethernet cable these days.  At Staples, you can pick up a standard black ethernet cable for about $22. At wholesale prices on Monoprice, you can get the same exact Ethernet cable -- length and color the same -- for less than $2. That's a more than 1,000% markup, and the latter is even less than the cost a cup of coffee or a smartphone app. When buying in bulk, for an office, that price goes down to $1.36 -- making the markup nearly 1,600%. A great rule to live by: If it's a cable or adapter of some kind, you're probably paying too much. Be careful what the advertisements (and coupons) tell you — not all retail chains are created equal. In fact, some of the most popular places to shop for your beloved tech may be sneakily marking up some of your most needed tech products, right under your nose.  The reason for the markups, undoubtedly, is demand. The biggest prices disparities in tech retail happen especially when consumers need a particular accessory or product to make their beloved gadgets work. People need HDMI cables, display adaptors and 3D glasses, therefore, they can be the most painful at checkout. SEE ALSO: 13 Strategic Ways Businesses Can Use Coupon Codes

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/tennis-technology-infographic/,How Technology Has Revolutionized Tennis,"As the Australian Open rages on Down Under this week, most fans won't realize just how much the game they love has evolved over the past several decades.  But tennis has, in fact, been dramatically altered by technology in ways that have changed how the biggest stars play the game and how fans consume it.  Rackets today are made from high-tech composite frames, which evolved from metal frames, which came from wood frames. In fact, players who played one of tennis' earliest predecessors are actually believed to have smacked the ball back and forth with their bare hands.   Playing surfaces are constructed from much more advanced materials now as well, and ball-tracking technology has grown by leaps and bounds. Medical technology has revolutionized how players stay safe and recover from injuries, while social media has completely transformed their relationship with the public.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/the-drowning/,"Finally, a First-Person Shooter You Can Play on a Tablet","We've seen all kinds of gaming genres make the move to mobile, first-person shooters chief among them. But anyone who has tried playing one on a tablet knows it can be frustrating to navigate with gestures in a game world created around a keyboard and a mouse. Ben Cousins of Scattered Entertainment thinks he has a solution for tricky tablet controls. His upcoming mobile game The Drowning is a horror-shooter hybrid; the world is being infected by terrifying reanimated creatures that gain their power from oil spills. The game is set some time after the main events of this apocalypse, and so the only people who remain are scavengers able to survive off the scraps. The game's protagonist is one such person, who happens to have an affinity for building weapons out of nothing. A former EA studio general manager, Cousins says first-person shooters are gaming's most lucrative genre; therefore, they definitely need a smooth transition to tablet. ""There's something about a shooter on tablet works really well,"" he says. ""Having that high-resolution screen close to your face reminds me of playing DOOM in 1992. But this virtual joystick system really doesn't work. I think the mistake with the sticks is they are trying to ape other console controls."" Cousin's ideas for tablet games are simple: It should be easy to hold your tablet in one hand while playing with the other. With that in mind, he says the development team at Shattered Entertainment have come up with controls they predict will be easy for anyone to use. Players can tap anywhere on the screen to move to that location, Cousins says, similar to the control structure in games like Diablo III. To fire their weapons, players tap with two fingers. The bullet targets to the middle of those two touchpoints. Navigate the world with simple swipe gestures.  ""We showed it to Apple and they were pleased. They said it's how they would would design the shooter,"" Cousins says. For a player to cozy up to new controls, the introductory game has to present the modifications in the best light. Cousins says having enemies who don't fire back is important, at least until players can get used to the accuracy of shooting with two fingers. ""Zombies enabled us to set the world in a much more realistic, modern setting. But we realized the George Romero formula had been done too much, and we didn't want to see a guy in a business suit as zombie another time,"" Cousins says. He adds, the infected creatures in The Drowning act more like rabid dogs or crazed primates than traditional zombies. Their goals are to drag helpless victims into the infected oil, converting them to monsters. The Drowning will be out for both iOS and Android some time in the first quarter of the year, according to Cousins. UPDATE: Scattered Entertainment released a video of Cousins demonstrating the controls. Check it out below.   Image courtesy of Scattered Entertainment "

However, during Apple's earnings call on Wednesday, CEO Tim Cook urged investors to ""question the accuracy"" of these reports. ""I know there have been lots of rumors about order cuts. I don't want to comment on any particular rumor because I would spend my life doing that,"" Cook said. ""I would suggest that it's good to question the accuracy of any rumor of bill plans."" ""Even if any particular data point were factual, it would be impossible to interpret what the data point meant for our overall business because the supply chain is very complex,"" Cook continued, noting that Apple has multiple supply sources and yields might vary for its products. ""There's an indordinate long list of things that would make any single data point not a great proxy for whats going.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/tumblr-in-the-future/,Beyond Reblogging: Tumblr in the Future,"There are two secrets to Tumblr's runaway success: design and community engagement. In 2012, the microblogging network became one of the top 10 most visited sites in the world, with an audience of roughly 170 million people per month—a dedicated userbase that includes everyone from President Obama and Beyonce to fandom communities and GIF artists. While Tumblr Storyboard—the company’s in-house editorial operation—helps spotlight and foster users’ creative contributions, the site’s simplistic interface drives the sharing of content, according to Lee Rubenstein, Tumblr's seventh user and cofounder of art forum EatSleepDraw. ""It is still very easy to use compared to Facebook,"" he said. Yet, amid never-ending reports on potential buyers, long-term profitability, and advertising revenue, Tumblr's future appears to be planned out in dollars and cents instead of notes—the internal mechanism that tracks how many likes, reblogs and comments a post has received — a sentiment furthered by founder David Karp recent Forbes profile. ""There's more to do, there's always so much engineering to do to serve more and more traffic, particularly when we don’t want to disturb the same traffic,"" the 26-year-old high school dropout told the publication that named him one of its 30 Under 30. ""The biggest thing by far is the infrastructure. ... [I]t demands an extraordinary team of real focus to make sure that we are constantly engineering Tumblr for the future."" But what exactly does that future look like, and more importantly, what should it look like according to the site’s most influential users? At the center of concern is the Radar feature, a tool used to highlight and introduce original and interesting content to all users. While originally a source of pride and credibility for Tumblr users eager to have their content shared, the feature became a potential revenue source in May, after Karp announced plans to sell Radar spots to advertisers for $25,000 a pop. ""On one hand you need the funds to keep a site operational, but on the other hand, the Radar used to be a badge of honor,"" noted Mr. GIF, a New York-based GIF duo. ""Getting on that radar is a huge moral boost for any creator. Some people think its unfair that brands can buy their way onto your dashboard."" Based on sponsored Radar ads and its Spotlight feature, where people pay to have their accounts promoted across specific tags, Tumblr has set a $100 million revenue goal for 2013, a year Gawker founder Nick Denton predicted will be “brutal” for the company. And with such a lofty goal, more interface changes are likely to come—and community outcry, as with every major social network, won't be far behind.  ""The most vulnerable thing in the Tumblr experience is its Dashboard—the main point of consumption, and it's the thing I think many of us are worried about,"" said marketer and Tumblr watchdog Andrea Lopez, who goes by bluechoochoo on the site. Whatever changes occurs, they will be incremental, stressed Tumblr designer Peter Vidani, who helped architect the Pinned Posts feature, among other notable features. ""The obvious reason this is good is so that you're not scaring everybody,"" Vidani said. ""By doing this we can learn a lot from each change we make and that will inevitably affect the other changes we thought we wanted to make."" Even still, as profit increasingly factors into the decision-making process, Tumblr has a tightrope to walk with its userbase—the content creators and agenda drivers who helped establish the company and drive its success. Some influential users, like Rubenstein and comedic powerhouse Benjamin Grelle, better known as the Frogman, believe a profit-sharing model akin to YouTube would be a more community-friendly way of doing business. ""I think it is crucial that Tumblr take care of their content creators,"" Grelle said. ""They should work to make this the best possible place for people to post things they make. If Tumblr could shift the perception from a place where people mostly repost things, to a place where things originate, I think they would leave their competitors in the dust.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/twitter-logo-middle-finger/,Are These Early Sketches of Twitter's Logo?,"Initial sketches looked sort of like a bald eagle. But on the right, the Twitter logo we now know began to take shape.  A standout here is that middle finger. Likely, the artists were just throwing out all kinds of ideas in an attempt to elicit the muse.  More whimsy in the form of a smoking bird and another sporting a wig.  ""The Bird"" was one of the ideas considered for Twitter's original logo. That is, the extended middle finger gesture known in North America by that name. Other ideas, however, hewed closer to traditional images of birds. That, at least, is one of the takeaways from a trove of putative early sketches of what became the Twitter logo. The images, uncovered by Slate, appear to be scrawled on brown paper towels you'd find in a bathroom. Twitter's design team also appears to have posted the illustrations on Dribbble. Twitter reps could not be reached for comment. Assuming the images are on the level, it's appears the team threw out all kinds of ideas for the logo no matter how whimsical. Among the sketches, for instances, is a smoking bird and one that looks like he's wearing a wig. However some of the designs look like the image Twitter ultimately settled on.

Dick Costolo, the CEO of Twitter, tweeted on Wednesday morning about making steak tartare, but unlike the more than 5,000 other tweets Costolo has posted to date, this one featured something different: a short embedded video that was made with Vine, a small video-sharing startup that Twitter acquired in October. If Costolo's tweet is any indication, it appears Twitter is planning to integrate Vine to allow users to embed short clips in their tweets in the same way that Twitter now lets users create and share Instagram-style photos in tweets. Steak tartare in six seconds. vine.co/v/bOIqn6rLeIDvia @dhof — dick costolo (@dickc) January 23, 2013 The Financial Review reports hearing from sources that Twitter will add Vine integration in Australia in the ""coming weeks,"" which will allow users to share 6-second videos in tweets.  Twitter declined to comment for this story. Would you use this video sharing option if it does come to Twitter? Let us know in the comments. Image courtesy of Flickr, Joi "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/unlocking-cellphones-illegal/,Unlocking Cellphones Becomes Illegal Saturday in the U.S.,"The clock to unlock a new mobile phone is running out. In October 2012, the Librarian of Congress, who determines exemptions to a strict anti-hacking law called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), decided that unlocking cellphones would no longer be allowed. But the librarian provided a 90-day window during which people could still buy a phone and unlock it. That window closes on Jan. 26. Unlocking a phone frees it from restrictions that keep the device from working on more than one carrier's network, allowing it run on other networks that use the same wireless standard. This can be useful to international travelers who need their phones to work on different networks. Other people just like the freedom of being able to switch carriers as they please. The new rule against unlocking cellphones won't be a problem for everybody, though. For example, Verizon's iPhone 5 comes out of the box already unlocked, and AT&T will unlock a phone once it is out of contract. SEE ALSO: Can I Get a Smartphone Without a Contract?
 You can also pay full price for a phone, not the discounted price that comes with a two-year service contract, to receive the device unlocked from the get-go. Apple sells an unlocked iPhone 5 starting at $649, and Google sells its Nexus 4 unlocked for $300.  Advocacy group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) questions whether the DMCA has the right to determine who can unlock a phone. In an email to TechNewsDaily, EFF attorney Mitch Stoltz said, ""Arguably, locking phone users into one carrier is not at all what the DMCA was meant to do. It's up to the courts to decide."" If you do buy a new phone and want to unlock it before the deadline, you must first ask your carrier if the company will unlock your phone for you. The DMCA only permits you to unlock your phone yourself once you've asked your carrier first. (Note that unlocking is different from ""jailbreaking,"" which opens the phone up for running additional software and remains legal for smartphones.) Christopher S. Reed from the U.S. Copyright Office noted in an email to TechNewsDaily that ""only a consumer, who is also the owner of the copy of software on the handset under the law, may unlock the handset."" But come Saturday, you'll have to break the law to unlock your phone. If you want to get in under the gun, you can search the Internet for the code to enter to unlock the phone or find a tool that will help you accomplish the task. The change could crimp the style of carriers like T-Mobile, which have pushed ""bring your own device"" as an incentive for switching service providers. Such carriers promise savings in exchange for using your existing phone on their network. T-Mobile has promoted this notion for iPhones, in particular, since the company is the only one of the big four U.S. carriers that doesn't sell the iPhone. The carrier goes so far as to feature ads displaying an open padlock, with an iPhone replacing the body of the lock. T-Mobile declined to comment. Photo courtesy of Flickr, Jhaymesisviphotography

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/victims-against-texxxan-and-godaddy/,Revenge-Porn Website Victims Launch Action Against Texxxan and GoDaddy," Victims of a so-called ""revenge porn"" website, which allows users to upload naked pictures of other people, identifying them by their name and hometown, have sued the site as well as its hosting company, GoDaddy. Last week, a class-action lawsuit was brought against the hosting giant and the website Texxxan.com. The plaintiffs are arguing that that these kind of ""involuntary"" or ""revenge"" porn websites violate Texas State privacy laws and are a ""blight upon society"" that serve ""no useful, social or economic purpose,"" the lawsuit states. The suit was brought forth by 16 named plaintiffs who are also seeking class-action status for all the rest of women appearing on the website.  GoDaddy is named as a defendant in the lawsuit as the plaintiffs argue that it's profiting off the ""offensive and tortious conduct"" of Texxxan.com. John S. Morgan, the lawyer contacted by the first victim who wanted to sue the revenge porn site, called people behind these kind of sites ""sickos who post private information of women without their knowledge."" The first website of this kind to make the news was IsAnybodyUp, a page run by 26-year-old entrepreneur and ""most hated man on the Internet,"" Hunter Moore. He started the website in 2009 as a way to get back at his ex-girlfriend after a bad break-up. The site was eventually taken down months ago. But soon an even sleazier imitator came up: IsAnybodyDown. The website works just as Moore's did, with scorned exes submitting pictures of their former partners without their consent, providing names, and sometimes even a screenshot of their Facebook profile and phone numbers.  Ars Technica has compared IsAnybodyDown to extortion. The site provides a service called ""Takedown Hammer"" that allows anybody who's unwillingly featured on the site (i.e., practically everybody) to ask the site to remove his or her picture. The caveat? It can cost hundreds of dollars. SEE ALSO:  Here's How Your Smartphone Is Ruining Your Sex Life
 It's unclear whether the victims can win the suit. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act protects webpages, making them not liable for user-submitted content. However, what is protected under Section 230 is unclear, and there are no precedents of revenge porn websites being sued for privacy infringement. Morgan argues they aren't protected because they willingly publish pictures without the victim's consent.  GoDaddy, on the other hand, should be protected. ""The legal question isn't close,"" Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University told Ars Technica. ""Section 230's immunity doesn't change even if GoDaddy knew it was hosting the site or could have easily disabled the website."" To learn more about this lawsuit, check out the video above.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/volvo-truck-no-squash/,Smart Brakes Stop This Truck from Squashing You Like a Bug," Cruising along at on the open road in your sweet ride is the stuff of romance movies and car commercials. Until that squirrel runs in front of you, you slam on the brakes and the semi truck behind you kisses your bumper at 40 MPH. It's not a pretty picture. Volvo, the automaker best known for deliriously safe vehicles, says it has the answer and offers proof in the white-knuckle video above.  Created by Volvo's trucks division (and introduced last year), the collision warning and emergency brake system is actually a series of tech steps designed to prevent one of its giant trucks from rear-ending a slowed or stationary vehicle. According to the release, the system employs radar to detect vehicles ahead. First it shows the driver a blinking red light. If he fails to notice, it adds a beeping sound. If those alerts fail, Volvo Trucks' system takes action — first gently applying the brake and eventually using the emergency brakes to bring the truck to a full stop. It works in trucks moving at up to roughly 43 mph. In the video, at least, the system appears to work and Volvo Trucks notes that the semi is fully loaded with 40 tons of ... well, no one but Volvo knows really. Since the company unveiled the technology last year, we suspect some of the specially-equipped trucks are already on the road. Have you seen any in action? Let us know in the comments below.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/what-does-the-sun-sound-like/,What Does the Sun Sound Like?," Robert Alexander is a data sonification specialist, which means that his job is, essentially, to convert data into sounds. Alexander takes collections of flat, static numbers — stock price variations, wind speeds, human pulse rates — and transforms them into music.  ""I think of myself as an explorer,"" Alexander says in the video above. ""I live in the space between art and science and technology."" And in the space — vast and narrow at the same time — between data and beauty. And you know something that offers a ton of both data and beauty? Our nearest star. Alexander has been putting his sonification skills to use to create, basically, a soundtrack for the sun. To do that, he relied on data gathered by the Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), a joint NASA-ESA spacecraft that astronomers use to study the sun. The vehicle, among other things, helps to predict the solar flares — gaseous eruptions from the solar surface, otherwise known as ""coronal mass ejections"" — that can disrupt electrical grids and communications infrastructures here on Earth.  Alexander manipulated those data to create songs that are both transcendent and utterly rooted in the physical world. As Motherboard's Michael Byrne puts it, ""He's rendered solar flares as a human choir, and turned the sun's rotation into a a tribal beat."" But solar sonification — ""interacting with the sun,"" Alexander calls it — isn't just about making artistic things out of science-y things. It's also about taking that data-driven art and using its patterns and rhythms and nuances and flows to learn something new.  At one point, Alexander, a fellow at NASA, noticed a unique hum in the solar sonification he'd created. Which in turn made him realize that sound can help humans detect carbon levels, which are in turn useful for measuring the actual temperatures of solar flares.  That insight resulted in a paper that was published last year in the Astrophysical Journal. We've always known that music has something to teach us; that truism could be even more true, however, when your inspiration — and your instrument — is the sun. Image courtesy of NASA

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/wikileaks-movie/,WikiLeaks Movie 'The Fifth Estate' Starts Production,"Principal photography for The Fifth Estate — a film based on the WikiLeaks saga — kicked off Wednesday. The film stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Julian Assange and Daniel Bruhl as Daniel Domscheit-Berg. Bill Condon, best known for Dreamgirls, Kinsey and The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, is directing.  Two books are serving as the basis for the film: Inside WikiLeaks: My Time with Julian Assange at the World's Most Dangerous Website by Daniel Domscheit-Berg and WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy by David Leigh and Luke Harding. According to DreamWorks, the studio spearheading the film, it will chronicle the early days of WikiLeaks leading up to the release of the Afghan War Diary in July 2010. Think The Social Network meets The Pentagon Papers.  DreamWorks and its co-financier Participant Media are targeting a Nov. 15, 2013 release date for The Fifth Estate. Here's what Condon had to say about the movie: ""It may be decades before we understand the full impact of WikiLeaks and how it's revolutionized the spread of information. So this film won't claim any long view authority on its subject, or attempt any final judgment. We want to explore the complexities and challenges of transparency in the information age and, we hope, enliven and enrich the conversations WikiLeaks has already provoked.""

http://mashable.com/2013/01/23/wind-waker-hd-zelda-nintendo/,"Nintendo Teases 'Wind Waker HD,' New 'Zelda' and 'Mario Kart'","Nintendo made several big announcements during its livestreamed presentation Wednesday morning, but the most exciting to fans were related to the Legend of Zelda franchise. First, Nintendo President Satoru Iwata announced GameCube's Wind Waker would get an HD remake for the Wii U, out this fall. Second, Iwata announced Nintendo was working on a new Legend of Zelda game for the Wii U. While he was coy on the details, he said this title would ""break conventions"" of the series, including traditional dungeon order and the single player experience. Could this be a cooperative or multiplayer Zelda? The Wind Waker HD remake will include remastered visuals and have functionality with the Wii U GamePad. ""The Wind Waker's endearing cartoon style is the perfect game for introducing first time players into the Zelda universe,"" Iwata said.  Screen shot from Wind Waker HD, from Nintendo. Iwata also said a new Mario Kart for Wii U was coming, the first confirmation of an update to the popular racing franchise. He also said that a new 3D Mario adventure game was in development by the makers of Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario 3D Land. A playable version of both will be available at E3, according to Nintendo. Other new unnamed titles were teased for the first time, included a Wii U party game by the makers of Wii Party. Videos showed off a game board world, along with mini games only playable on the GamePad's screen. There was also a Yoshi game by the makers of Kirby's Epic Yarn that showed the green dinosaur made of yarn.  While there was plenty of discussion of games far off on the horizon, there weren't any games with hard release dates. The Wii U won't see any new games until March, for which Iwata apologized.  ""Nintendo takes seriously its responsibility to offer a steady stream of new titles in the very early days of a new platform to establish a good lineup of new software. On the other hand, we also firmly believe we have to offer quality experiences when we release new titles. Based on our software development schedules at the end of last year, we concluded we should spend a little more time to satisfy our Nintendo standard of quality. I apologize to those supporting Wii U about the lack of new titles from Nintendo in January and February, but please understand we'll have a steady stream of new titles from March onward,"" Iwata said. Iwata also announced that Wii U will be getting its own Virtual Console similar to the Wii's sometime in the spring. The Virtual Console will allow players to download classic Nintendo games and play them on their Wii U. The Wii U's Virtual Console was delayed so that games could be played on just the GamePad controller and MiiVerse, the Wii U's social network. This does mean that Wii Virtual Console games won't work in the same way, and anyone who wants the updated Wii U version of an old game will have to redownload it. Nintendo did say players doing that would only have to play between $1 and $1.50. Only NES and Super NES titles will be available first, and not all classic games will be available immediately. Iwata also announced some classic games would be released for just 30 cents to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Famicom, the NES's Japanese cousin. Starting today, Wii U owners can download Balloon Drop from the Wii U shop at that price. Image courtesy of Vinylzen. "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/24/amazon-ivona/,Is This Kindle's Siri? Amazon Buys Speech-Recognition Firm Ivona,"In a move that may augur more Siri-like functionality for its tablets, Amazon on Thursday announced it is buying Ivona, a firm specializing in text-to-speech technology. The Poland-based Ivona's technology verbalizes written text messages. Amazon has been using Ivona's technology for its Kindle e-readers since 2009. Ivona also supplies ""Explore By Touch"" and ""Voice Guide"" navigation for Kindle Fire models. Explore By Touch gives readers an auditory cue when they swipe their fingers across the Kindle Fire's menu (for instance, the title of a book would be read aloud if it was swiped.) In Voice Guide, any action the customer performs on the device is read aloud. In Amazon's example, when you open a new book, it would say ""The Hunger Games. Book opened."" Both features are aimed at vision-impaired customers.  While the technology appears to be the exact opposite of Apple's Siri, Amazon's purchase might signal increased hands-free features that could be employed on a rumored Amazon phone.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/24/amazon-page-best-resume-ever/,Fake Amazon Page Is Best Online Resume Ever,"We don't actually know if Philippe Dubost is any good at his job. But boy, can he throw together a resume.  Dubost, a web product manager currently based in Paris, is looking to travel for his next position. So he decided to make his CV stand out anywhere in the world — by mimicking an Amazon product page.  The result, ""Philippe's Amaz'ing Resume,"" is a pitch-perfect pastiche. Suggesting that you add the applicant to your shopping cart to see his price is such a clever way of asking to be hired, we're amazed no one thought of it before. Especially when followed by the urgent reminder: ""only 1 left in stock. Order soon!"" You can see the full resume here. But in case Dubost's site has been overwhelmed by traffic — he's already had to change his web hosting service once, according to his Twitter feed — here's another screenshot.   Dubost has taken pains to replicate every last aspect of an Amazon page — even inserting an ad. We've seen resumes that look like Facebook pages and Twitter feeds before, but none have this much attention to detail.  And given the fact that hiring is a transaction, making it look like the world's largest store makes a ton of sense.  Would you hire an applicant based on a resume like this? Let us know in the comments, and check out our galleries of other unusual CV designs below. Meghan Molino's resume pops out for many reasons: Not only does it have a 3D feel but it also reveals the multiple dimensions of her personality. ""I'm a very visual person, and I wanted a resume that honed in on how I prefer to digest data and that also showcased my own creativity.  I'm an out-of-the-box thinker. I didn't want a standard resume that on first glance makes you look like everyone else,"" said Molino, who is a product launch specialist. Molino had Hagan Blount (whose resume is slide seven in this gallery) redesign her resume to further establish her online identity as a creative professional. ""I love my current job, so I'm not necessarily on the market for something new."" Despite not actively looking for a new employer, Molino has created buzz around her skills. ""What's been fascinating is to see who has approached me since publicizing this resume. It's a sort of vetting document. Corporate America may not 'get it,' but companies that embrace individuality and want their employees to be impactful, curious and take risks — they've loved it."" João Dornellas, a designer for YDreams, created this iPad app resume to show off his portfolio. It has been downloaded more than 2,200 times. In need of a job, Claudio Nader turned his Facebook profile into what he dubs the first ""FacebookCV,""  a curriculum vitae on his profile. The FacebookCV landed him a gig as social media assistant and content editor for a web marketing agency in Milan, he said in a blog post. If you'd like to mimic his efforts, check out the FacebookCV tutorial he wrote. Jonathan Cropper has always felt that the standard text-driven resume needed a refresh. ""Resume design is a classic branding error. Institutional conformity in a design-driven world is a recipe for failure,"" said Cropper, a communications and branding expert. Cropper wanted to give his resume a ""futuristic, militaristic precision tone"" to match his work style. (Hagan Blount, whose resume is slide seven in this gallery, designed the resume.) ""The map and SMS and QR codes on that document also communicate that I have a global and digital mindset,"" he added.  This Twitter-inspired resume comes to us from Rouyer Arnaud of France. Although the design of the site resembles Twitter, Arnaud said all of the code was rewritten from scratch. When you click on a tweet, more information pops up on the right panel. Give it a go here. ""Who said resumes and CVs all have to be boring and official and unfunny? I'm too creative for that! I'll make a resume that looks like a Twitter account,"" Arnaud wrote in a tweet on his resume website. Saidur Hossain added tags to his resume [PDF link]. It's a subtle, fun addition for a web designer's resume. Hagan Blount's infographic resume is packed with visuals: a map, a chart, QR codes and logos. ""Jon (from slide four in this gallery) actually inspired me to create the resume,"" Blount said. ""I'd seen the 'creative resume' posts from graphic designers but not from people looking for jobs outside that field. ""Jon showed me some of those resumes and postulated that they would become the de facto standard. I agreed and made one over the course of the next few days, and Jon was my first client. I sent it to a few friends on Facebook, and when I saw the massive amount of hits I had [on] my site the next day, I started pushing it harder and it ended up being published all over the world."" "

http://mashable.com/2013/01/24/ashton-kutcher-steve-jobs-video-scene/,See Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs in This Video,"A scene from jOBS, the upcoming independent film about tech icon Steve Jobs, has surfaced and it gives us the first video glimpse of Ashton Kutcher as the former Apple CEO. In this video, Jobs tries to persuade Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak that his ""operating system"" can be sold to the masses. Book of Mormon actor Josh Gad plays Wozniak. 







 The film — not to be confused with the one Sony Pictures is creating based on Walter Isaacson's biography of the late tech luminary — will premiere this week at the Sundance Film Festival and arrive in theaters on April 19.  Jobs died from pancreatic cancer in 2011.  SEE ALSO: 6 Ways to Enjoy the Sundance Film Festival From Afar
 Distributors Open Road Films and Five Star Feature Films released this deeper synopsis of jOBS earlier this month:  Directed by Joshua Michael Stern, written by Matthew Whitely, shot by Oscar- winning cinematographer Russell Carpenter and produced by Mark Hulme, jOBS details the major moments and defining characters that influenced Steve Jobs on a daily basis from 1971 through 2000. jOBS plunges into the depths of his character, creating an intense dialogue-driven story that is as much a sweeping epic as it is an immensely personal portrait of Steve Jobs' life. The filmmakers were granted unprecedented access during shooting to the historic garage in Palo Alto, that served as the birthplace to Apple Inc. Mark Hulme of Five Star has called Kutcher's acting ""inspiring and unforgettable."" Kutcher, who stars in CBS's Two and a Half Men, previously played roles on Fox'sThat '70s Show and in films such as The Butterfly Effect, No Strings Attached, Valentine's Day and Dude, Where's My Car? What do you think of Ashton Kutcher's performance in the above scene?  Steve Jobs introduces the Macintosh to the world. Computing would never be the same. Ridley Scott's famous ""1984"" commercial for the original Macintosh continues to find imitators, even today. In 2011, Motorola attempted to spoof the classic ad in a promotional spot for its Xoom tablet. When Bill Gates appeared on-screen at Macworld Boston in 1997, the audience reacted with boos and hisses. Still, the decision to partner with Microsoft and have Microsoft commit to producing software for the Macintosh was one of the most shrewd -- and likely one of the most intelligent -- decisions that Jobs made upon his return to Apple. Although many incorrectly believe that Microsoft ""bought"" Apple in 1997, the reality is, without Microsoft's investment and commitment to developing Macintosh software, the company may have had a more difficult time getting its next line of products to the market. The iMac helped set the standard for the modern Apple even as we know it today. Designed by Jonathan Ive, the iMac was sleek, modern and affordable. This was not the Macintosh of the early to mid 1990s, it was something new.  With the iMac, Apple became cool. We can vividly remember looking at the egg-shaped all-in-one design with the hockey puck mouse and famous lack of a floppy drive and being transfixed. The iMac marked the beginning of Apple 2.0. Nearly 10 years ago, Apple debuted the iPod. Famously ridiculed and dismissed by Slashdot, it would be several years before the device would  become iconic, and in the process, change Apple fundamentally as a company. The premise behind the iPod was simple: 1,000 songs in your pocket. Its the execution that set the device apart from everyone else.  In 2003, Apple flipped the switch again, with the launch of the iTunes Music Store. In a post-Napster industry, most were skeptical that iTunes could drive music sales. Eight years later, iTunes is the number one music retailer by a large margin. Ten years on, the iPod is getting long in the tooth, but it still remains the leader in its product category. After the iPod started to achieve massive success in 2003 and 2004, the rumors of an iPod phone started to swirl. The first attempt to bring a product like that to the market was in the form of Motorola's Rokr. The Rokr tried to capitalize on the success of the Razr, while also adding compatibility with iTunes. Still, the device was a dud. You can see Steve Jobs's frustration with the device in this demonstration. The Rokr was an example that only Apple could build an Apple product. Steve Jobs's commencement speech at Stanford University in 2006 is one of our favorite Jobs moments. It's riveting, inspirational and every bit as good as any Apple product keynote. All hail the Jesus Phone. The iPhone changed the mobile industry. Full stop. The mobile world and ecosystem that we know today would not exist in the same way that it does now without the iPhone. The iPhone also changed Apple as a company and helped further cement Jobs's place in history. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are two of the most powerful and influential men of our times. Seeing them together at D5, just ahead of the iPhone's U.S. launch, was amazing. In January 2010, Apple changed the game again with the iPad. Like the iPod and iPhone, the critics dismissed it and predicted its failure. Its success has outpaced nearly every other technology product launch in history and is having a seismic impact on education, publishing, media consumption and computing in general. The PC era might not be over, but I'm willing to bet that the computer I use every day in 10 years will have a lot more in common with the iPad than the MacBook Pro.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/24/belkin-buys-linksys/,Belkin Acquires Linksys From Cisco,"Belkin announced Thursday that it is acquiring Cisco's Home Networking Business Unit, including the Linksys brand, current products and employees. The financial details of the deal — which officially take Cisco out of the consumer business — weren't disclosed. With Linksys and Belkin under the same roof, Belkin says it will account for 30% of the U.S. retail home and small business networking market. We had a chance to speak with Belkin CEO Chet Pipkin about the acquisition and what it means for the Belkin and Linksys brands in the future. If you're an existing Linksys customer, you don't need to worry. Belkin will maintain support for its products and all valid warranties will be honored for current and future Linksys products. Moreover, the Linksys brand will continue to exist and Pipkin said that the company would be making continued investments in both the Linksys and Belkin brands. When I asked Pipkin about differentiation in markets where the two brands sell the same type of product — such as home networking — he explained the philosophy behind each name. ""We like to think about the Belkin brand as being a brand that makes user interfaces simple and easy to understand,"" Pipkin said. It's strong in areas like smartphones and tablets and is very consumer friendly. ""Linksys has a very impressive install base and a great reputation for reliability in the prosumer space,"" Pipkin said, adding, ""We will continue to celebrate and further accelerate the unique brand process for both Belkin and Linksys."" Beyond that, Pipkin said that the company will look at how it can create complimentary product experiences. For example, an accessory for a smartphone or tablet could have the Belkin branding and be designed to work in tandem with a Linksys-branded router. Cisco acquired Linksys back in 2003 as a way to get into the then-burgeoning home networking space. Last month, Cisco turned to Barclays to sell off the division. The sale is the culmination of a strategy Cisco started back in 2011 — when it shut down its Flip camera business just two years after acquiring Flip's maker, PureDigital.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/24/common-crawl-google/,Free Database of the Entire Web May Spawn the Next Google,"Google famously started out as little more than a more efficient algorithm for ranking web pages. But the company also built its success on crawling the web — using software that visits every page in order to build up a vast index of online content. A nonprofit called Common Crawl is now using its own web crawler and making a giant copy of the web that it makes accessible to anyone. The organization offers up more than 5 billion web pages, available for free so that researchers and entrepreneurs can try things otherwise possible only for those with access to resources on the scale of Google’s. ""The web represents, as far as I know, the largest accumulation of knowledge, and there’s so much you can build on top,” says entrepreneur Gilad Elbaz, who founded Common Crawl. “But simply doing the huge amount of work that’s necessary to get at all that information is a large blocker; few organizations … have had the resources to do that."" New search engines are just one of the things that can be built using an index of the web, says Elbaz, who points out that Google’s translation software was trained using online text available in multiple languages. “The only way they could do that was by starting with a massive crawl. That’s put them on the way to build the Star Trek translator,” he says. “Having an open, shared, corpus of human knowledge is simply a way of democratizing access to information that’s fundamental to innovation.” Elbaz says he noticed around five years ago that researchers with new ideas about how to use Web data felt compelled to take jobs at Google because it was the only place they could test those ideas. He says Common Crawl’s data will make it easier for novel ideas to gain traction, both in the world of startups and in academic research. Elbaz is the founder and CEO of big data company Factual, and before that founded a company bought by Google to be the basis of its ad business for webpages. Common Crawl also has Google’s director of research, Peter Norvig, and MIT Media Lab director Joi Ito on its advisory board. Common Crawl has so far indexed more than 5 billion pages, adding up to 81 terabytes of data, made available through Amazon’s cloud computing service. For about $25 a programmer could set up an account with Amazon and get to work crunching Common Crawl data, says Lisa Green, Common Crawl’s director. The Internet Archive, another nonprofit, also compiles a copy of the web and offers a service called the “Wayback Machine” that can show old versions of a particular page. However, it doesn’t allow anyone to analyze all its data at once in that way. Common Crawl has already inspired or helped out some new web startups. TinEye, a “reverse” search engine that finds images similar to one provided by the user, made use of early Common Crawl data to get started. One programmer’s personal project using Common Crawl data to measure how many of the web's pages connect to Facebook — some 22%, he concluded — led to his securing funding for a startup, Lucky Oyster, based on helping people find useful information in their social data. Other ideas enabled by the project emerged from a contest run last year that awarded prizes for the best use cases. One of the winners used Wikipedia links in crawl data to build a service capable of defining the meanings of words; another tried to determine public attitudes toward congressional legislation by analyzing the content of online discussions about new laws. Rich Skrenta, cofounder and CEO of search engine startup Blekko, says Common Crawl’s data fulfills a definite need in the startup community. He says Blekko has been approached by startups with technology needing access to large collections of online data. “That kind of data is now easily available from Common Crawl,” says Skrenta, whose company contributed some of its own data to the project in December 2012. Blekko shared information from its system that categorizes Web pages by content, for example labeling whether they contain pornography or spam. Ben Zhao, an assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who uses large collections of web data for research into activity on social sites, says Common Crawl’s data is likely unique.  ""Fresh, large-scale crawls are quite rare, and I am not personally aware of places to get large crawl data on the web,"" he says. However, Zhao notes that some of the most interesting and valuable parts of the web won’t be well represented in Common Crawl’s data: ""Social sites are quite sensitive about their content these days, and many implement anti-crawling mechanisms to limit the speed anyone can access their content."" To access this data, researchers must strike up relationships with companies and rely on whatever they will release — a route less available to startups who may be seen as competition.

Derek Benson takes it to a whole new level, combining his passion for art and all things nerdy with his kids' daily meals. Every day, the father of three decorates his children's lunch bags with a new illustration, taking inspiration from shows or books he shares with the family.  Since 2008, Benson has been spending his lunch breaks with Sharpies and oil pastels in hand. Each drawing takes no more than 30 minutes, with something different for each child. His eldest daughter Dana, now 12, isn't too keen on the idea of still taking Daddy's drawings to school, but Benson is illustrating her first novel. Sons Dylan and Liam on the other hand, still get the attention of teachers and classmates with their brown paper bags.  He started out by writing their names, then it got more elaborate, Benson tells Mashable.  ""It's a conversation piece and something a little more fun for them to take to class,"" he says. ""It's something to do to keep my skills up and it keeps the kids involved, making them feel like everybody's on the same team here.""
  
The lunch bags feature characters ranging from Super Mario to My Neighbor Totoro. He started chronicling his illustrations on his Tumblr, and posts trivia lunch bags for followers to answer. Check out the gallery, above, for more of Benson's drawings.  Much of his inspiration comes from ""a lot of nerd stuff"" and literary characters. On top of being a painter, Benson is also a video game developer and says he enjoys bonding over illustrations of obscure characters with viewers that recognize them.  SEE ALSO: 10 Glorious Shake My Head Dad Moments
 When he first started posting pictures of the bags, he received some criticism from other parents online, who thought a mother with help was behind the drawings.  ""It was really strange at first. I didn't say anything about myself when posting so people assumed I was the mom and were saying things like, 'It must be nice to have a maid,'"" Benson says. ""Then they find out I'm the dad and — hold on — it's praise because I'm so involved. It's really not that big a deal."" Benson's wife, Heather, prepares the kids' lunches while he creates the drawings sometimes days in advance. He works on them in his spare time, sometimes while waiting at the doctor's office.  But what happens when lunch is over? Some bags get thrown away, others are given to classmates, hung up on classroom walls or reused as gift bags. His son even takes requests from girls which, we'd wager, probably doesn't hurt his popularity.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/24/death-of-foodstagram/,Death of Foodstagram? Restaurants Ban Customers From Taking Food Pics,"Some restaurants have started banning customers from taking photos of their food, the New York Times reports, quoting several chefs in New York City.  If other restaurants follow suit, it may signal the demise of ""foodstagramming,"" a popular practice that involves restaurant-goers taking Instagram pictures of their meals, and sharing them online. While some find it silly and annoying, others just can't stop themselves from photographing that juicy steak in front of them. Policies around food photography vary from restaurant to restaurant; they range from restrictions on using flash to outright bans. “Some people are arrogant about it. They don’t understand why. But we explain that it’s one big table and we want the people around you to enjoy their meal. They pay a lot of money for this meal. It became even a distraction for the chef,” said Moe Issa, owner of Chef’s Table at Brooklyn Fare.  While not everyone who photographs their food uses Instagram, the photo-sharing service now has 90 million monthly active users, and foodstagramming has become quite the fad.  Are you also guilty of taking photos of your meals? Do you think restaurant owners should ban the practice? Share your thoughts in the comments below.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/24/dont-count-apple-out/,Don't Count Apple Out,"Yes, I too am frustrated that Apple has spent more time in the last two years iterating than innovating. We’ve come to rely on Apple for the new thing we never knew we needed and, instead, we get the somewhat better thing we probably want anyway. This, along with seismic changes at the top, the loss of Steve Jobs and growing dissatisfaction with CEO Tim Cook’s leadership has led us here — to a moment where Apple could stop being the most valuable company in the world. So what? Apple is still successful. It reported record revenue, sold millions of devices and has a boatload of cash in the U.S. and offshore. It can still take something like the iPad mini,  the most expensive of all “around 7-inch” tablets and sell it as if it were water in the desert. I was kind of hard on Apple for its decision to ignore the market and vastly overprice the iPad mini, but I did say it was beautiful. In fact, it’s almost shamefully so. Put the mini next to any competing 7-inch tablet and there is no comparison. Apple built the mid-size tablet as it should be: exquisitely thin and light and highly usable. Other tablets have more power, but nothing feels like the mini. iPad mini owners have told me so. They also surprised me by using the smaller tablet for productivity. For them, this was not a tablet with deficits, it was the tablet they had been waiting for. Apple sold 22.9 million iPads last quarter, but refuses to break down how many for each model. On the other hand, they sold 15.4 million a year ago, so it stands to reason that the iPad mini accounts for at least a portion of the additional 7 million. In fact, I’d bet that the mini has dug into the traditional iPad share a bit. That’s probably OK with Apple. The whole idea of the mini was to offer variety and satisfy those who thought the full-size iPad was too big and heavy. I know that sounds crazy, but more than one Mini owner told me they chose it for just that reason: They wanted an iPad, but thought it was too big. In short, I think the mini is a success. Similarly, Apple sold 10 million more iPhones than it did the year prior. The iPhone 5 is clearly at the heart of that success story. For any other company, this kind of success would be lauded. Unfortunately, Apple is not just any company. It led on the innovation front for far too long. The question people are asking now is if Apple can ever introduce another iPhone, iPod, iTunes, iPad or MacBook Air again. Each of these products redefined an industry. The clear-headed among us understand that not a single one was an entirely new idea. They were all reinventions and refashionings of decent and even failed ideas. Some insist Apple TV is the answer. Apple must finally launch its own TV set. Personally, I wish people would stop talking about an Apple TV. It’s my least favorite idea for the tech marvel. When I mentioned it to tech execs at CES 2013, most agreed it was a terrible business to get into with absolutely horrific margins. Apple will not be able to control the entire experience because it has to share the interface with cable and satellite companies — a situation that’s an anathema to everything Apple stands for. This is not to say Apple won’t do it. Tim Cook has offered every indication that they will, but I remain skeptical that they can do it successfully. I’ve long believed that there’s a whiteboard somewhere in the back halls of 1 Infinite Loop, covered with all of the late Steve Jobs' craziest and most profound ideas. Apple TV is certainly on there, but I also think there are other wilder ideas. Apple’s always collecting new patents for strange new interfaces, power sources, connectors, small ideas that could lead to big, unusual new products. Apple’s iterative strategy is, obviously, not a recipe for long-term success. You have to bring something new to the table, especially when a large chunk of your business is disappearing. Did anyone take a good look at the 16% and 15% drop off in revenue for, respectively, Macs and iPods? The rapid decline of the desktop PC business (and somewhat slower decline of laptops) will only accelerate over the next few years. Apple needs something new to fill that gap. Yet, I have this gut feeling (based on 27 years of experience in the industry) that Apple and Tim Cook are going to surprise us in 2013. Sure, we’ll see more iteration — that’s a natural part of the tech business. However, I think Apple has something big up its sleeve. We may not see it in the spring, but by June or July, we’ll be talking about Apple’s first major innovation in nearly three years. I believe this to be true, not just because I like it when Apple delivers the goods, but because I think Steve Jobs set Apple up with a raft of big ideas, and Tim Cook is a better CEO than people think. And no, I do not believe Jonathan Ive is the right guy to run Apple. When that happens –- and it will –- this stock dip and deep uncertainty about Apple’s future will be nothing but a blip, no more than a reflection on the surface of the next great gadget Apple delivers.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/24/energy-fee/,Energy Company Issues Flat Fee to Compensate for Low Sales,"An Arizona energy provider is charging its customers an additional monthly rate to make up for a decline in sales, ABC 15 reports.    APS, the Phoenix metro area-based provider, informed its customers of the upcoming charges — which will officially begin in March — in their January bills. The reason for lower sales, according to the statement, is an increasing number of customers utilizing energy efficient appliances, such as solar powered systems and compact fluorescent light bulbs.  In other words: customers are saving a little too much energy. A photo of the announcement, above, was posted on Reddit by user graykat777 on Wednesday night. Part of the statement says: In May 2012, the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) approved new rates for APS. Because more customers are installing renewable energy systems such as solar and wind, and energy efficiency measures such as compact fluorescent light bulbs and refrigerator recycling, APS is selling less electricity, but fixed costs remain. APS is allowed to implement a new charge to recover a portion of the fixed costs
 Greg Balas, a customer service representative for APS, said the charges are essential for meeting a goal established by the ACC. ""We have fixed costs for power poles, wires, infrastructure — things like that,"" he told Mashable. ""Without the help of customers in meeting those goals, we can't provide the energy."" The fees are relatively small. Customers have two options: the Lost Fixed Cost Recovery (LFCR) or Flat Charge. The LFCR adds an extra 0.29% of a customer's total bill, before taxes, to their amount each month. The Flat Charge varies on a customer's total kilowatt usage. If a customer uses between 0 to 400 kilowatts each month, for example, they'll be charged an additional 60 cents; any usage over 200,000 kilowatts amounts to around $6 extra per month. (According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average American customer used 958 kilowatts per month in 2010.)   At the time of writing, there wasn't a press release or official announcement posted on APS' website. Read the full announcement here.  SEE ALSO: 4 Smart Thermostats That Save Energy and Money
 What do you think of the fee? Or, better yet, are you an APS customer who will soon be affected by the charges? Let us know below.  BONUS: Bringing Solar Power Into Your Life
 JOOS solar chargers take the guess work out of solar with an app that allows you to see how much power the panel has stored while it's charging. The JOOS is a small panel (about 8x6 inches) that powers about two hours of talk time with every hour under the sun. JOOS charges cell phones, cameras, tablets and more and is a great device to use for a day spent outdoors. For on-the-go charging, try Voltaic’s Fuse 10W Solar Laptop Charger. The flexible panel can strap onto your backpack or a large bag to absorb the sun's rays. In addition to laptops, the Fuse 10W charges cameras, cell phones and tablets. One hour in direct sunlight gives you 30 minutes of laptop time. Goal Zero is the solar charger for the adventurer. The kit can bring a dead smartphone back to life instantly or fully charge one in three hours. Rugged, foldable solar panels can charge the usual gadgets and an LED light–perfect for lighting the way along dark paths after a long day of hiking or when you lose power.  Goal Zero has set up a ""Buy one, we give one"" program to benefit Sandy Relief. The company will match the same amount customers spend on their products to Hurricane Sandy relief efforts in the form of portable solar-power solutions. Goal Zero staff delivered solar powered lamps to hurricane victims without power.  Personal solar products are also great for those who want to soak up the sun with a good book all day. Kindle users can charge their reader in the sun all day and read all night with Solarmio’s Kindle lighted cover. The cover can store up to 50 hours of extra battery time, perfect for an un-plugged vacation. SunVolt is a new member of the solar powered club. This Kickstarter project uses larger solar panels that fold up into a case. The larger panels allow you to connect your devices directly to the charger and give you charging speeds that are on par with what you’d get when plugging into the wall. The SunVolt Charging Station powers up laptops, tablets, cell phones and cameras. Image courtesy of Reddit, graykat777; thumbnail image courtesy of Flickr, Peter Hellberg "

Video courtesy of ThoseCrazyTexans The pilot behind the controls during a daring airborne stunt seen in a YouTube video gone viral is under investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration, according to local media reports. Stunt pilot Jason Newburg is being probed for the high-speed low pass involving a land vehicle, which was captured by a person on the ground at Lancaster Regional Airport in Lancaster, Texas. It was soon after uploaded to YouTube, reports NBC 5. Normal FAA rules forbid the low-altitude flying demonstrated in the video, especially when people are in harm's way. FAA regulations specifically state that ""no person may operate an aircraft in a careless or reckless manner so as to endanger the life or property of another."" SEE ALSO: Watch This Near-Death Experience With a Biplane
 The FAA does, however, grant waivers for stunt pilots. A Lancaster city manager told NBC 5 that Newburg has a valid waiver for practicing daring maneuvers, but the FAA told the station their copy of Newburg's waiver carries a November 2012 expiration date. ""Even with a waiver, there a requirement that people on the ground not be endangered,"" FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford told NBC 5. Newburg has defended the video, telling NBC 5 that ""this was a structured shoot, and some people don't understand that."" ""All of the people at the practice were briefed and were part of the crew,"" he continued. Newburg, 43, is a veteran stunt pilot who often incorporates ground vehicles into his aerial acrobatics routine, as seen in videos of his past performances: Video courtesy of MrJasperBulldogs Video courtesy of PatrickStephens In the clip most recently gone viral, Newburg is flying a Pitts Special, a biplane specifically designed for aerobatic stunt flying.

The app launched this morning, and previously offered users a way to see which of their Twitter and Facebook friends were also using the service, in addition to contacts stored in their phone. A request to search for Facebook friends on Vine now yields a pop-up message indicating that the app is not authorized to make the Facebook request. The dialog box was first spotted by a Verge reader.  A Twitter spokesperson told Mashable the company didn’t have anything to share beyond that notification. We've reached out to Facebook for comment. We're also currently unable to share videos from Vine on Facebook. While we did not receive an error message to this effect, videos shared from the app have still not appeared on our timeline.  Vine has been experiencing considerable delays posting to social networks — including Twitter — so its possible that videos are just severely delayed rather than disabled.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/24/florida-cat-200-miles/,"Lost Cat Travels Two Months, 200 Miles Home","A tortoise-shell cat similar to the one pictured above became separated from its family in Daytona Beach, Fla., and then managed to find its way to West Palm Beach after a two-month, nearly 200-mile journey.  The four-year-old indoor cat, named Holly, is owned by Jacob Richter, 70, and Bonnie Richter, 63, who began traveling around in an R.V. with Holly last year. During a vacation this past November to Daytona, the cat dashed out an opened door. The Richters called local animal agencies and posted fliers, but Holly never turned up. They returned home. Two weeks later, an animal rescue worker called the Richters to tell them that a cat resembling Holly had been sited in Daytona. SEE ALSO: KittyCam Catches Cat’s Feral Side
 And then nearly two months later, on New Year’s Eve, a woman who lived about a mile away from the Richters found an underweight, dehydrated and weakened cat in her backyard who could barely meow. The woman, Barb Mazzola, and her children fed and cared for the cat for six days, finally coaxing it into the house. Mazzola took the cat to a vet, who scanned it for an implanted microchip. Indeed, there was a chip, which lead directly back to the Richters. How an indoor cat made such a long journey across unfamiliar territory is a mystery. “I really believe these stories, but they’re just hard to explain,” Marc Bekoff, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Colorado told the New York Times. “Maybe being street-smart, maybe reading animal cues, maybe being able to read cars, maybe being a good hunter. I have no data for this.” Back in September, 2011, Willow the cat (pictured above) was found in New York City fives years after she went missing in Boulder, Co. How Williow got to the Big Apple remains a mystery, but she was also positively identified thanks to an implanted microchip. SEE ALSO: Why Cats, Other Carnivores, Don’t Taste Sweets
 But how domestic cats find their way is not something researchers devote much time to studying. A handful of experiments, however, give clues. Back in 1954, British cat biologist, Roger Tabor placed cats in a covered circular maze that had exits every 15 degrees. Most of the cats used the exit that pointed in the direction of their homes. And more recently, researchers in the Kitty Cams Project attached video cameras to 55 pet cats and recorded their behavior. The study found that some cats visited other homes for food and affection, crossed roads and ate and drank things from the wild. Holly’s mother was feral and it’s possible that Holly has some wild cat instincts, but how she found her way home is still a mystery. Only Holly knows what happened those two months and she’s not saying a word. Photo courtesy of Flickr, funnyface_6

In the next few days, images will be displayed in an inline panel so that users can quickly flip through a set of images using their keyboard, Google announced in a blog post. ""Based on feedback from users and webmasters, we redesigned Google Images to provide a better search experience,"" Hongyi Li, Google's associate product manager, wrote. As a result, it will be ""faster, more beautiful and more reliable,"" he added. With Google's updated image search, users will see one main image framed by a display of smaller images above and below.  What's more, rather than getting sent to a separate landing page, users will see image metadata (or information) directly underneath the image. The title of the page hosting the image, the domain name it comes from and the image size will also be featured ""much more prominently"" next to the image, Li said.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/24/google-warrants-email-cloud-data/,Google Says It Always Requires Warrants for User Email and Cloud Data,"Google revealed Wednesday that it always requires a search warrant whenever authorities seek access to the content of a user's emails or documents stored in Google's cloud, Wired reported.  The company's insistence in asking for a warrant is seemingly against current law. Particularly, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which allows authorities to get access to information stored on a server for more than 180 days with a simple subpoena. The law states that if there are ""reasonable grounds to believe"" that the information could be useful as part of an investigation, there's no need for a judge's intervention.  The law was passed in 1986, when emails were deleted from servers every time a user downloaded them — and cloud storage wasn't even in the wildest dreams of a computer scientist. According to the law, emails left on a server for more than six months were considered abandoned, and thus freely accessible to authorities. Nowadays, critics say, with the advent of cloud based storage, the law is out of date. That seems to be Google's thinking as well. ""Google requires an ECPA search warrant for contents of Gmail and other services based on the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, which prevents unreasonable search and seizure,” Chris Gaither, a Google spokesman told Wired's blog Threat Level. The search giant can afford to do that because there have been a series of conflicting court rulings that have interpreted the ECPA and the Fourth Amendment in different ways. In 2010, a federal appeals court weighed in on the matter. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the government must have a valid warrant to access email content stored on a provider's server. The judges wrote that email content shouldn't be treated differently than phone calls and letters — which can't be accessed without a warrant.

 ""Given the fundamental similarities between email and traditional forms of communication, it would defy common sense to afford emails lesser Fourth Amendment protection,"" the ruling read. ""First, the very fact that information is being passed through a communications network is a paramount Fourth Amendment consideration. [...] Second, the Fourth Amendment must keep pace with the inexorable march of technological progress, or its guarantees will wither and perish."" This decision was followed by two different court cases in 2012, one in Kansas and the other in Minnesota. None of the cases, however, set a national precedent, and the Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the matter.  These decisions give Google some leeway to protect its users' privacy. ""Law enforcement agencies must be able to pursue illegal activity and keep the public safe. But it’s just as important that laws protect our users against overly broad requests for their personal information,"" Gaither wrote in an email statement to Mashable. ""Respect for the privacy and security of data that users store with Google underpins our approach. Before complying with a government request, we make sure it follows the law and Google's policies."" Google does turn over some information to the authorities without requiring a warrant, the so-called email metadata. That is, things like the names users provide when creating accounts, IP addresses of the computer where the account was created, what time and where somebody signs in or out of a Google account, the non-content part of emails like the addressee and sender, its date, and the IP address used to send a particular email.  Repeated legislative efforts to review the ECPA have so far faltered. The most recent attempt, led by the Senate Judiciary Committee, added email protections to the so-called Netflix bill. The provisions, which would have required authorities to get a warrant whenever they wanted to access a suspect's email, were stripped out of the bill when it was approved at the end of 2012.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/24/hands-on-with-vine/,"Hands On With Twitter's Social Video App, Vine"," Twitter launched Vine on Thursday — an app that lets you share 6-second video clips. Currently iOS-only, the stop-motion videos can include as many scenes as you can fit in. Video stops and starts when you press on your device’s screen. Your finished product can then be shared just on Vine, or with friends on Twitter or — in theory — Facebook. Still in its infancy, the service isn’t without drawbacks. Sharing for instance can only be done when the video is initially uploaded. So if you forget to select that Twitter button when you upload your followers will be out of luck forever. Thursday at least, uploading those videos to social networks also takes a bit of time. Some of our videos went up immediately, while others took close to an hour. SEE ALSO: Vine Mania! 10 Creative Vines on Twitter Sound is also recorded along with each video clip. While that’s not a huge deal if you’re recording in a quiet location, video recorded where there’s a lot of noise can sound choppy and be jarring for viewers. (Videos play automatically in Twitter, but the default setting appears to be on mute.) And then there’s Twitter's relationship with Facebook. A few hours after the app’s launch Thursday Facebook blocked the service from being able to access your friends lists.  Knowing which of your Facebook friends are using Vine isn’t essential to the service, but it does tend to make finding those friends –- who you might not be connected to on Twitter –- that much harder. Have you tried Vine out yet? Let us know what you think about the app in the comments. You can sign into Vine using your Twitter account or email address. If you choose to sign in via Twitter, you'll be prompted to give the app access to your Twitter account. Vine will pull in your name, profile picture, and bio from Twitter to create your profile. You can edit that information if you'd like your Vine profile to be a little different than your profile on Twitter. When linked, your profile on Vine includes the same information as your profile on Twitter. On screen prompts will walk you through the process of creating your first Vine. The green bar at the top of the screen shows you how much of the 6-second time allotment you've already used up. Once you're done shooting a video you're prompted to add a caption or location information to the video, as well as specify where you'd like to share it. Finished Vines show up on a timeline, similar to Instagram's interface. You can browse through Editor's Picks, Vines that are popular now, and all Vines on the service. Vines can be explored by topic. So you can check out Vines from NYC, Sports, or even Pet videos. Videos on the timeline autoplay when they're displayed on your screen. Just because you're following someone on Twitter doesn't mean you'll automatically be following them on Vine. The service works independently of Twitter, so you'll have to follow (and be followed by) everyone again. The service will, however, pull in a list of your Twitter or Facebook friends on Vine to make that process a little easier. Mashable Thumbnail, Emily Price "
http://mashable.com/2013/01/24/hollywood-stars-singing/,10 Movie Stars With Surprising Musical Talents,"Did you know the Dirty Dancing soundtrack featured a song from the film's star? Jessica Biel croons the opening credits song for her period movie Easy Virtue.  Really, Sly? This isn't the first time Gwyneth has sung on screen (she belted out a few in Duets and made a Glee appearance). But ""Country Strong"" from the film of the same name was released as an actual single.  As well as songs for Twilight, Robert sang for indie comedy-drama How To Be. Matt didn't need a singing double for The Talented Mr. Ripley. Anne was practicing for her Les Mis role way back in 2004. Colin goes all country for Crazy Heart. Sung by Adam Sandler, this song is actually featured on The Wedding Singer soundtrack. Finally, not technically a soundtrack, but oh em gee!  Many Hollywood stars have attempted the crossover from actor to musician, but what's more surprising is how many, albeit not known for their singing ability, have recorded songs for film soundtracks. Whether it's Colin Farrell belting out a country track or Sylvester Stallone crooning a smooth, jazzy number, you'll be amazed who has contributed to Hollywood soundtracks.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/24/hypersonic-spaceliner/,"In 2050, Flight Time From Europe to Australia Will Be 90 Minutes","A hypersonic ""SpaceLiner"" would whisk up to 50 passengers from Europe to Australia in 90 minutes. The futuristic vehicle would do so by riding a rocket into Earth's upper atmosphere, reaching 24 times the speed of sound before gliding in for a landing. Many challenges still remain, including finding the right shape for the vehicle, said Martin Sippel, project coordinator for SpaceLiner at the German Aerospace Center. But he suggested the project could make enough progress to begin attracting private funding in another 10 years and aim for full operations by 2050. The current concept includes a rocket booster stage for launch and a separate orbiter stage to carry passengers halfway around the world without ever making it to space. Flight times between the U.S. and Europe could fall to just over an hour if the SpaceLiner takes off — that is, if passengers don't mind paying the equivalent of space tourism prices around several hundred thousand dollars. ""Maybe we can best characterize the SpaceLiner by saying it's a kind of second-generation space shuttle, but with a completely different task,"" Sippel said. SpaceLiner passengers would have eight minutes to experience the rocket launch before they reached an altitude of about 47 to 50 miles (75 to 80 kilometers). That falls short of the 62-mile (100-km) boundary considered the edge of space, but even a suborbital flight would allow SpaceLiner to glide back to Earth at hypersonic speeds of more than 15,000 mph (25,200 kph). The rocket-powered design stands out compared with other proposed hypersonic jets, which feature new air-breathing engine concepts. European aerospace giant EADS previously unveiled a hypersonic jet concept that would rely mainly upon air-breathing ramjets to reach cruising speeds of Mach 4 — faster than the supersonic Concorde's Mach 2 performances but far slower than the SpaceLiner's Mach 24 goal. SpaceLiner's European project planners say their reliance upon proven rocket technology could allow their vehicle to fly sooner rather than later. They plan to use liquid oxygen and hydrogen rocket propellants so that the rocket engines leave only water vapor and hydrogen in the atmosphere.

 ""We will not try to improve the performance of the engine but would like to have it more reusable,"" Sippel told TechNewsDaily. The empty rocket stage from SpaceLiner would return to Earth immediately after launch in preparation for reuse. An aircraft could grab the rocket stage in midair, tow it toward an airfield and release it for an autonomous gliding landing. But big challenges remain before SpaceLiner can take off. Researchers first must finalize a design shape capable of surviving the intense heat created by gliding at hypersonic speeds through the upper atmosphere. New cooling technologies and improved heat shielding for SpaceLiner's wing ""leading edge"" could help in that case. Launching like a rocket rather than taking off like an aircraft means SpaceLiner would remain restricted to suitable launch sites with uninhabited areas down range. The SpaceLiner also would need a careful flight path during its final landing approach — the ""sonic boom"" shock that accompanies aircraft traveling faster than the speed of sound can damage buildings on the ground at low altitudes. ""The profile of the vehicle is very similar to a rocket-propelled vehicle,"" Sippel explained. ""We only have a small corridor in which we can fly safely and economically."" SpaceLiner's design will make use of study results from a FAST20XX (Future High-Altitude High-Speed Transport 20XX) project funded by the European Union and backed by researchers from Germany, Austria, Spain, Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Sweden. It can also draw lessons from upcoming efforts such as Project ALPHA by Aerospace Innovation GmbH — a space plane that aims to launch in midair from an Airbus A330 aircraft. But future success ultimately depends upon the success of space tourism efforts by companies such as Virgin Galactic. If enough people prove willing to pay top dollar for suborbital flights as part of their travels around the world, Sippel envisions a fleet of SpaceLiners eventually making 10 to 15 flights per day.

http://mashable.com/2013/01/24/ibm-hydrogel/,IBM Creates Weapon to Destroy Drug-Resistant Bacteria," Biofilms — groups of microorganisms that adhere to a surface — can be a real problem. When bacteria form a biofilm, it's difficult to treat since the cells are so densely packed. But now IBM has created a new substance that can break through biofilms such as plaque and drug-resistant bacteria, killing them while not harming humans. IBM Research and the Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology created a antimicrobial hydrogel — a highly absorbent substance made from synthetic polymers — that annihilates bacterial biofilms on contact. IBM claims the hydrogel is 100% efficient in destroying biofilms. The gel forms spontaneously when heated to body temperature. It's also biodegradable and non-toxic. The image below demonstrates the gel's effectiveness. According to IBM, on the left is a mature and healthy biofilm. The photo on the right shows the same biofilm after the hydrogel is applied. IBM says the small portion of cells that remain have drastically disrupted membrane, preventing resistance.  The hydrogel has clear applications in medicine, and IBM says it could be a tool hospital workers use to reduce health hazards. For example, biofilms build up on catheters quickly, so they need to be changed frequently. A catheter treated with the hydrogel, however, would prevent the biofilm from forming, reducing the risk of infection and letting the hospital change it less often. Hospitals are notorious for being breeding grounds for infection, and biofilms are a contributing factor. The discovery could potentially put a dent in hospital-acquired infections, which the US Department of Health and Human Services says is one of the top five causes of death in the country.

 IBM says the it helped create the hydrogel through processes that were originally used in semiconductor manufacturing. The company's ""nanomedicine"" program began four years ago and looks for ways to apply IBM's decades of research (and massive patent portfolio) to improve medicine.
